   MAYOR VARTIAINEN:  Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, dear
   friends, it is my great pleasure to warmly welcome you all to the
   beautiful capital of Finland, Helsinki, and the Helsinki City Hall.

   sack Helsinki in weeks – so confident that they had Dmitri Shostakovich
   compose music for the victory parade, before the Winter War even
   started.
--
   proposals to reduce tensions.  Together with our allies and partners,
   we used every forum to try to prevent war, from the NATO-Russia Council
   to the OSCE, from the UN to our direct channels.
--
   President Biden made clear that regardless of which path President
   Putin chose, we would be ready.  And if Russia chose war, we would do
   three things: support Ukraine, impose severe costs on Russia, and
--
   clear that no amount of diplomatic effort was going to change President
   Putin’s mind.  He would choose war.
   And so, on February 17, 2022, I went before the United Nations Security
   Council to warn the world that Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine
   was imminent.
--
   We hoped – we hoped – to be proven wrong.
   Unfortunately, we were right.  A week after my warning to the Security
   Council, President Putin invaded.  Ukrainians of all walks of life –

   Today, what I want to do is set out this and the many other ways
   Putin’s war of aggression against Ukraine has been a strategic failure,
   greatly diminishing Russia’s power, its interests, and its influence

   unlikely.  The United States had significantly reduced its forces in
   Europe since the end of the Cold War, from 315,000 in 1989 to 61,000 at
   the end of 2013.  Many European countries’ spending on defense had been

   the European Union, and other partners around the world have severely
   degraded Russia’s war machine and defense exports, setting them back
   for years to come.  Russia’s global defense partners and customers can

   Putin invested in technology and innovation rather than weapons and
   war.
   Russia’s foreign reserves are down by more than half, as are profits

   rallied to defend it.
   Sixth, prior to the war, President Putin regularly used Russia’s
   influence in international organizations to try to weaken the United
--
   Charter.   And countries from every part of the world are supporting
   efforts to hold Russia accountable for its war crimes and crimes
   against humanity, from creating a special UN commission to document the
   crimes and human rights violations committed in Russia’s war to
   assisting investigations by prosecutors in Ukraine and at the
--
   We have no quarrel with the Russian people, who had no say in starting
   this tragic war.  We lament that Putin is sending tens of thousands of
   Russians to their deaths in a war he could end now, if he chose – and
   inflicting ruinous impact on Russia’s economy and its
   prospects.  Indeed, it must be asked:  How has Putin’s war improved the
   lives, the livelihoods, or the prospects of ordinary Russian citizens?
--
   up for the international rules and principles that are threatened by
   Putin’s ongoing war.
   Let me say this directly to the Russian people:  The United States is
   not your enemy.  At the peaceful end of the Cold War, we shared the
   hope that Russia would emerge to a brighter future, free and open,

   the strength of its economy and its democracy. This is at the heart of
   our vision for the way forward:  Ukraine must not only survive, it must
   thrive.  To be strong enough to deter and defend against aggressors

   union formally granted Ukraine EU candidate status.  And Kyiv is
   working to make progress toward the EU’s benchmarks even as it fights
   for its survival.

   paves the way for diplomacy.  President Zelenskyy has said repeatedly
   that diplomacy is the only way to end this war, and we agree.  In
   December, he put forward a vision for a just and lasting
   peace.  Instead of engaging on that proposal or even offering one of

   Two of the six children Russia killed in a single strike.  Two of the
   thousands of Ukrainian children killed by Russia’s war of aggression.
   Thousands more have been wounded, and thousands beyond that have been
--
   Millions have been displaced.  All are part of a generation of
   Ukrainian children terrorized, traumatized, scarred by Putin’s war of
   aggression, all of whom remind us why Ukrainians are so fiercely
--
   we’d stop supporting Ukraine, and then if Ukraine truly wanted to end
   the war, it would just cut its losses and give up the fifth of its
   territory that Russia illegally occupies.  Let’s play this out for a
--
   sovereignty and territorial integrity if Putin’s aggression were to be
   rewarded with a fifth of Ukraine’s territory?
   And for that matter, how would any country that lives near a bully,

   connected to concrete actions, especially military withdrawal.  A just
   and lasting peace must end Russia’s war of aggression.
   Now, over the coming weeks and months, some countries will call for a
   ceasefire.  And on the surface, that sounds sensible – attractive,
   even.  After all, who doesn’t want warring parties to lay down their
   arms?  Who doesn’t want the killing to stop?
--
   It’s a Potemkin peace.  It would legitimize Russia’s land grab.  It
   would reward the aggressor and punish the victim.
   If and when Russia is ready to work for true peace, the United States

   original members of the Alliance gathered in Washington to sign its
   founding treaty.  President Truman warned the group, and I quote, “We
   cannot succeed if our people are haunted by the constant fear of

   individually against attack.  [W]e hope to create a shield against
   aggression and the fear of aggression – a bulwark which will permit us
   to get on with the real business of . . . achieving a fuller and
--
   people if it lives in constant fear of aggression.  That’s why we’ve
   all got a stake in ensuring that President Putin’s war of aggression
   against Ukraine continues to be a strategic failure.
