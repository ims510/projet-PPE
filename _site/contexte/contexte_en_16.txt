   What psychology is common to most, if not all wars? What mindsets lead
   to war?
   Human history is mostly of conflict and war. History teaches many
   lessons, but has few students. It seems that the main fact that humans
   can learn from history is that humans don’t learn from history.
   The cycle seems to be: conflict leading to war, massive damage,
   casualties and costs on all sides, collective statements of ‘never
   again’, followed by a short period of peace, then repeat.
   War seems so much part of the human condition that it is reasonable to
   ask: are humans hard-wired for war? Do genetics drive people to war so
   that their genes can be better reproduced after destroying the genes of
--
   Many anthropologists and archaeologists have provided evidence that
   human warfare emerged around only 6000 to 10000 years ago. The
   emergence of war coincides with the creation of agrarian systems and
   societies. Organising the mass production of food freed many people

   class then emerged.
   If wars only began after some people had the free time and the status
   to direct it, that indicates: the desire for war is not hard-wired, or,
   if hard-wired, the desire for war requires that time and resources are
   available for any such genes to be expressed.
   In the last 3000 years there have been few periods without war in
   Europe where richer nations appeared to have the genes, the time and
   resources. However, since the foundation of the forerunner of the EU in
   the aftermath of WWII, (created to prevent war), there have been no
   wars between any members of the EU, despite having the same gene pool,
   and vast time and resources being available. What explains the outbreak

   together, and have peaceful ways of resolving the inevitable conflicts,
   don’t make war on each other. Possibly where there is shared law, and
   equal access to justice, creating the mechanisms of trust, people
   generally live in peace, despite any minor disagreements. If war were
   hard-wired, and made possible by time and resource availability, such
   trading and cooperation structures as the EU would not prevent war.
   Most civil wars in recent history took place despite all of the above
   apparently being in place. Perhaps, when those systems break down war
   is still possible, or, is even inevitable. For example, when one or
   both parties to a potential civil war are not prepared to accept a
   shared solution, or, there is no mechanism to find, or implement, a new
   mutually acceptable status quo, perhaps war, or the separation of the
   parties in to new countries, is the only way to resolve the conflict.
--
   Indeed, many countries were formed under exactly those circumstances.
   War could be a toxic side effect induced by the type of people who
   enter politics. The characteristics widely thought to be necessary to

   psychopathy. Perhaps it is the dysfunctional psychology of many
   political “leaders,” that leads to war; in their attempts to cling to
   power they relinquish any principle, tell any lie, and order any act.
   Anyone who has followed a war either in real time, or in history, will
   have noted the lies that are told, and atrocities committed by both
   sides. ‘Truth is the first casualty of war,’ although often stated as
   truism, is, itself, not true. By the time someone is in a position to
   call for, or order war, truth and integrity have long since been
   accepted as ongoing collateral damage in their quest for power. War
   reveals that mendacity more starkly.
   Some wars are fought over control of or access to resources. Most
   species of animal only kill to eat. Those that kill but do not eat,
   usually do so, only if they are under actual physical threat. Humans
   will kill each other if their ideas are under threat. Many wars are
   fought over political ideology, religion, values, beliefs, governmental

   conflate personal survival with the acceptance of their ideas? Do
   people need validation so much that they are willing to go to war for
   it? While that may sound irrational, it seems to be so when people
   declare such as: ‘I am willing to kill or die for my beliefs.’ Here is
   an example from the cold war era: ‘I’d rather be dead than Red.’
   Politicians throughout history have directed people to commit murder on
--
   Since few people are prepared to harm anyone, let alone those who are
   just like them, it is necessary for politicians who wish war to
   ‘otherise’; to create an enemy, to spin that enemy as an existential
   threat to their people, to their way of life, to their ideas.
   The horrors of war are only possible if decent people can be convinced
   to murder; if they become the ‘Universal Soldier’, (as so well

   human rights; they are the subjects of moral exclusion.
   The brainwashing process of preparing a people for war is the same one
   that is used by cult leaders to disparage non-cult members, and keep
   cult members under control.
   Many other psychological factors are involved in war. Here are just
   some:
Revenge
   War based on revenge has has been present in several parts of the world
   for millennia. Each party seeks “justice” for the last “injustice”
--
Fear
   Humans have, over and over again, gone to war, for fear of being
   attacked. That is, fear of war creates war. Countless lives have been
   lost in ‘pre-emptive’ attacks to ‘defend’ against a threat that was
--
Hypocrisy
   Each party involved feels their war is ‘just’, in various forms:
   defending their country, their way of life, their resources, their
   morality. Each can justify fighting a war with their righteous
   indignation, but their enemies are condemned for thinking and acting in
--
   murder of their ‘enemies’, the egos of leaders in the present are
   tempted to write their place in history via war. What kind of person is
   prepared to authorise the massacre of millions to make themself
   ‘immortal’? A psychopath. The history and psychology of war seems to be
   the history and psychology of psychopaths.
--
“God is on our side”
   War after war has been fought in the name of religion, or justified
   using religion. Both sides use the same justifications and/or claim
--
   (for example, not to kill). Religion is co-opted and corrupted by
   politicians, and used to ‘justify’ war.
The first act of any organisation

   gripped by group think, it can quickly start and continue the madness
   of war.
There are no winners
   War almost always emerges as a result of a toxic cocktail of
   dysfunctional psychology. It matters not which side has the most
   delusional thinking, there are no winners in war, only greater or
   lesser losers.
   The people who fight wars are the youngest, fittest, and strongest,
   huge numbers of whom are killed in battle. The gene pool is diminished

   Vast numbers of the soldiers involved in a war have their lives ruined
   by post traumatic stress injury. They suffer nightmares for life, their

   suicide are all higher in those unlucky enough to have seen the reality
   of war.
   Few peoples have avoided paying massive costs for going to war. Are the
   costs of directing a country to go to war borne by those who direct it?
   No. Political systems seem to immunise those who start wars from the
   consequences of their decisions. Perhaps that immunity makes them more
