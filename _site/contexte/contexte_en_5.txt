   World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or in
   historical contexts, the Great War, was a global conflict from 1914 to
   1918. It was fought between two coalitions: the Allied Powers and the
   Central Powers. Fighting took place throughout Europe, the Middle East,
   Africa, the Pacific, and parts of Asia. One of the deadliest wars in
   history, it resulted in an estimated 9 million soldiers dead and 23
   million wounded, plus another 5 million civilian deaths from various
   causes. Millions more died as a result of genocide, and the war was a
   major factor in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.

   Austria-Hungary held Serbia responsible, and declared war on 28 July.

   was more dynamic, but neither side could gain a decisive advantage,
   despite costly offensives. As the war expanded to more fronts,
   Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Italy and others joined in from 1915 onward.
   In early 1917, the United States entered the war on the side of the
   Allies, and later the same year, the Bolsheviks seized power in the

   the creation of new independent states, including Poland, Finland,
   Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The inability to manage post-war
   instability contributed to the outbreak of World War II in September
   1939.
Names
   The term world war was first coined in September 1914 by German
   biologist and philosopher Ernst Haeckel. He claimed that "there is no
   doubt that the course and character of the feared 'European War' ...
   will become the first world war in the full sense of the word,"^[1] in
   The Indianapolis Star on 20 September 1914.
   The term First World War had been used by Lt-Col. Charles à Court
   Repington, as a title for his memoirs (published in 1920); he had noted

   University in his diary entry of 10 September 1918.^[2]^[3]
   Prior to World War II, the events of 1914–1918 were generally known as
   the Great War or simply the World War.^[4] In August 1914, the magazine
   The Independent wrote "This is the Great War. It names itself".^[5] In
   October 1914, the Canadian magazine Maclean's similarly wrote, "Some
   wars name themselves. This is the Great War."^[6] Contemporary
   Europeans also referred to it as "the war to end war" and it was also
   described as "the war to end all wars" due to their perception of its
   unparalleled scale, devastation, and loss of life.^[7]

   decline of the Ottoman Empire, New Imperialism, and the rise of Prussia
   under Otto von Bismarck. The 1866 Austro-Prussian War established

   into a German Empire under Prussian leadership. Avenging the defeat of

   In order to isolate France and avoid a war on two fronts, Bismarck
   negotiated the League of the Three Emperors (German: Dreikaiserbund)

   historian Laurence Van Ypersele emphasises the central role played by
   memory of the war and the Versailles Treaty in German politics in the
   1920s and 1930s:
     Active denial of war guilt in Germany and German resentment at both
     reparations and continued Allied occupation of the Rhineland made
     widespread revision of the meaning and memory of the war
     problematic. The legend of the "stab in the back" and the wish to

   A number of socialist parties initially supported the war when it began
   in August 1914.^[304] But European socialists split on national lines,
--
   Marxists and syndicalists being overborne by their patriotic support
   for the war.^[311] Once the war began, Austrian, British, French,
   German, and Russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current
   by supporting their countries' intervention in the war.^[312]
   Italian nationalism was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was
   initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions. One of
   the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of the
   war was Gabriele D'Annunzio, who promoted Italian irredentism and
   helped sway the Italian public to support intervention in the
   war.^[313] The Italian Liberal Party, under the leadership of Paolo
   Boselli, promoted intervention in the war on the side of the Allies and
   used the Dante Alighieri Society to promote Italian nationalism.^[314]
   Italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose
   it; some were militant supporters of the war, including Benito
   Mussolini and Leonida Bissolati.^[315] However, the Italian Socialist
   Party decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors were
   killed, resulting in a general strike called Red Week.^[316] The
   Italian Socialist Party purged itself of pro-war nationalist members,
   including Mussolini.^[316] Mussolini, a syndicalist who supported the
   war on grounds of irredentist claims on Italian-populated regions of
   Austria-Hungary, formed the pro-interventionist Il Popolo d'Italia and

   that had resurfaced in 1912, and by July 1914 there was a serious
   possibility of an outbreak of civil war in Ireland. Irish nationalists
   and Marxists attempted to pursue Irish independence, culminating in the

   The first tentative efforts to comprehend the meaning and consequences
   of modern warfare began during the initial phases of the war; this
   process continued throughout and after the end of hostilities, and is
   still underway more than a century later. Teaching World War I has
   presented special challenges. When compared with World War II, the
   First World War is often thought to be "a wrong war fought for the
   wrong reasons"; it lacks the metanarrative of good versus evil that
   characterizes retellings of the Second World War. Lacking recognizable
   heroes and villains, it is often taught thematically, invoking tropes
   like the wastefulness of war, the folly of generals and the innocence
   of soldiers. The complexity of the conflict is mostly obscured by these
   oversimplifications.^[347] George Kennan referred to the war as the
   "seminal catastrophe of the 20th century".^[348]
