   NEW YORK (AP) — Oscar-winning actor Susan Sarandon and “Scream” star
   Melissa Barrera were each dropped by Hollywood companies after making
   comments on the Israel-Hamas war that some deemed antisemitic.

   Spyglass Media Group, the production company behind the upcoming “Scream
   VII,” acknowledged Barrera’s exit from the horror franchise. The
   Mexican-born actress, who starred in “In the Heights” and the two recent
   “Scream” installments, had posted statements on Instagram Stories calling
   the war “genocide and ethnic cleansing.”

   “Gaza,” she wrote, “is currently being treated like a concentration camp.”

   Spyglass said in a statement that its position “is unequivocally clear: We
   have zero tolerance for antisemitism or the incitement of hate in any
   form, including false references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, Holocaust
   distortion or anything that flagrantly crosses the line into hate speech.”

   Late Wednesday, Barrera posted a statement on Instagram Stories about her
   firing.

   “First and foremost I condemn antisemitism and Islamophobia. I condemn
   hate and prejudice of any kind against any group of people,” she wrote.

   Gaza health officials say they lost the ability to count dead as Israeli
   offensive intensifies

   “I believe a group of people are NOT their leadership, and that no
   governing body should be above criticism,” she added. “I pray day and
   night for no more deaths, for no more violence, and for peaceful
   co-existence. I will continue to speak out for those that need it most and
   continue to advocate for peace and safety, for human rights and freedom.”

   Earlier Wednesday, Deadline reported that Jenna Ortega, who played
   Barrera’s sister in the two previous “Scream” films, has exited the
   seventh installment. Ortega earlier departed the franchise because of her
   “Wednesday” schedule, the trade reported. A spokesperson for Ortega didn’t
   immediately respond to queries.

   A spokesman for the United Talent Agency said Sarandon, the five-time
   Oscar nominee, is no longer represented by the agency. Sarandon’s exit
   from UTA followed comments she’s made about Israel, most recently in an
   appearance Nov. 17 at a pro-Palestinian rally in New York.

   “There are a lot of people afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are
   getting a taste of what it feels like to be a Muslim in this country, so
   often subjected to violence,” Sarandon said, according to the New York
   Post.

   The Post reported that Sarandon joined the crowd in chanting “From the
   river to the sea, Palestine will be free” — a slogan some see as
   antisemitic because it suggests the eradication of Israel.

   Sarandon could not be reached for comment Wednesday. At the rally, she
   also was quoted as saying: “There’s a terrible thing that’s happened where
   antisemitism has been confused with speaking up against Israel. I am
   against antisemitism. I am against Islamophobia.”

   The Israel-Hamas war has caused rifts throughout Hollywood. Earlier, when
   many groups were issuing statements condemning Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on
   Israel, the Writers Guild of America ultimately didn’t after failing to
   come to an agreement. Maha Dakhil, a prominent agent with Creative Arts
   Agency, last month resigned her board seat after sharing a social media
   post accusing Israel of genocide. Dakhil apologized.

   Israel and Hamas on Wednesday agreed to a four-day cease-fire in the war
   in Gaza.
