   What psychology is common to most, if not all wars? What mindsets lead to
   war? 

   Human history is mostly of conflict and war. History teaches many lessons,
   but has few students. It seems that the main fact that humans can learn
   from history is that humans don’t learn from history. 

   The cycle seems to be: conflict leading to war, massive damage, casualties
   and costs on all sides, collective statements of ‘never again’, followed
   by a short period of peace, then repeat. 

   War seems so much part of the human condition that it is reasonable to
   ask: are humans hard-wired for war? Do genetics drive people to war so
   that their genes can be better reproduced after destroying the genes of
   ‘others’ who compete for resources?

   Many anthropologists and archaeologists have provided evidence that human
   warfare emerged around only 6000 to 10000 years ago. The emergence of war
   coincides with the creation of agrarian systems and societies. Organising
   the mass production of food freed many people from the never ending cycle
   of hunting and gathering. That in turn, enabled some people to live off
   the labour of others; a ‘leadership‘ class then emerged. 

   If wars only began after some people had the free time and the status to
   direct it, that indicates: the desire for war is not hard-wired, or, if
   hard-wired, the desire for war requires that time and resources are
   available for any such genes to be expressed. 

   In the last 3000 years there have been few periods without war in Europe
   where richer nations appeared to have the genes, the time and resources.
   However, since the foundation of the forerunner of the EU in the aftermath
   of WWII, (created to prevent war), there have been no wars between any
   members of the EU, despite having the same gene pool, and vast time and
   resources being available. What explains the outbreak of nearly 80 years
   of peace?   

   Perhaps people who trade together, work together and make decisions
   together, and have peaceful ways of resolving the inevitable conflicts,
   don’t make war on each other. Possibly where there is shared law, and
   equal access to justice, creating the mechanisms of trust, people
   generally live in peace, despite any minor disagreements. If war were
   hard-wired, and made possible by time and resource availability, such
   trading and cooperation structures as the EU would not prevent war. 

   Most civil wars in recent history took place despite all of the above
   apparently being in place. Perhaps, when those systems break down war is
   still possible, or, is even inevitable. For example, when one or both
   parties to a potential civil war are not prepared to accept a shared
   solution, or, there is no mechanism to find, or implement, a new mutually
   acceptable status quo, perhaps war, or the separation of the parties in to
   new countries, is the only way to resolve the conflict. 

   That has been the solution to many conflicts. Three example from recent
   history are the former Yugoslavia, East Timor, and Sudan, Africa. Indeed,
   many countries were formed under exactly those circumstances. 

   War could be a toxic side effect induced by the type of people who enter
   politics. The characteristics widely thought to be necessary to thrive in
   political systems, are: mendacity, narcissism, and psychopathy. Perhaps it
   is the dysfunctional psychology of many political “leaders,” that leads to
   war; in their attempts to cling to power they relinquish any principle,
   tell any lie, and order any act. 

   Anyone who has followed a war either in real time, or in history, will
   have noted the lies that are told, and atrocities committed by both sides.
   ‘Truth is the first casualty of war,’ although often stated as truism, is,
   itself, not true. By the time someone is in a position to call for, or
   order war, truth and integrity have long since been accepted as ongoing
   collateral damage in their quest for power. War reveals that mendacity
   more starkly.

   Some wars are fought over control of or access to resources. Most species
   of animal only kill to eat. Those that kill but do not eat, usually do so,
   only if they are under actual physical threat. Humans will kill each other
   if their ideas are under threat. Many wars are fought over political
   ideology, religion, values, beliefs, governmental systems, etc. 

   Perhaps ideas, ideologies, can work in a way similar to genes. Could it be
   that humans compete for their ideas to be accepted? Do humans conflate
   personal survival with the acceptance of their ideas? Do people need
   validation so much that they are willing to go to war for it? While that
   may sound irrational, it seems to be so when people declare such as: ‘I am
   willing to kill or die for my beliefs.’ Here is an example from the cold
   war era: ‘I’d rather be dead than Red.’

   Politicians throughout history have directed people to commit murder on a
   huge scale over arbitrary ideas such as ‘countries’. ‘Patriotism is the
   last refuge of scoundrels,’ was said by Winston Churchill, before he, too,
   took refuge in the idea of ‘country’.

   Since few people are prepared to harm anyone, let alone those who are just
   like them, it is necessary for politicians who wish war to ‘otherise’; to
   create an enemy, to spin that enemy as an existential threat to their
   people, to their way of life, to their ideas. 

   The horrors of war are only possible if decent people can be convinced to
   murder; if they become the ‘Universal Soldier’, (as so well explained in
   the song by that name by Buffy Sainte-Marie). The process is started
   slowly, reasonably; the ‘other’ is contrasted with how civilised and
   honourable ‘we are’, Then, gradually the ‘other’ is demonised, and
   dehumanised. Once the newly minted ‘universal soldier’ is convinced that
   the ‘other’ is deserving of their fate, they will happily commit any
   atrocity ordered; their targets have foregone their human rights; they are
   the subjects of moral exclusion. 

   The brainwashing process of preparing a people for war is the same one
   that is used by cult leaders to disparage non-cult members, and keep cult
   members under control.

   Many other psychological factors are involved in war. Here are just some:

Revenge 

   War based on revenge has has been present in several parts of the world
   for millennia. Each party seeks “justice” for the last “injustice” imposed
   on them, and in so doing they impose another injustice, and the cycle
   continues, often for generations. 

Fear

   Humans have, over and over again, gone to war, for fear of being attacked.
   That is, fear of war creates war. Countless lives have been lost in
   ‘pre-emptive’ attacks to ‘defend’ against a threat that was utterly
   baseless. Repeatedly,  peoples have been manipulated by politicians to
   attack before they are attacked, when no such attack was intended or
   possible.

Hypocrisy

   Each party involved feels their war is ‘just’, in various forms: defending
   their country, their way of life, their resources, their morality. Each
   can justify fighting a war with their righteous indignation, but their
   enemies are condemned for thinking and acting in exactly the same way. 

Heroising 

   When leaders of the past are lauded as ‘great’ for having led the mass
   murder of their ‘enemies’, the egos of leaders in the present are tempted
   to write their place in history via war. What kind of person is prepared
   to authorise the massacre of millions to make themself ‘immortal’? A
   psychopath. The history and psychology of war seems to be the history and
   psychology of psychopaths.

Logic justifies emotion

   Most of us like to think we are rational and logical, that our emotions
   follow our logical analyses. Alas, we are not. It is the other way around:
   our logic is used to justify our emotions. Even the most base of emotions
   can be justified with logic, in very predictable ways:  

   ‘We don’t like [insert name of the “other”]. They are [insert wild
   imagined threats]. They are [insert baseless accusation of horrible
   characteristics]. We should [insert call to damage the “other”] to save
   ourselves, from them.’

“God is on our side”

   War after war has been fought in the name of religion, or justified using
   religion. Both sides use the same justifications and/or claim religious
   validation for breaking their legal and religious principles (for example,
   not to kill). Religion is co-opted and corrupted by politicians, and used
   to ‘justify’ war. 

The first act of any organisation 

   Organisations, like living systems, immediately they come into existence,
   set about protecting their existence. Arbitrary concepts such as groups,
   companies, and countries, seek to protect themselves, even if that means
   that all real and actual living members or citizens are annihilated.
   Governments have massacred their own people too in the name of ‘the
   party’.

Group think

   When a group of people comes together, they quickly adopt shared norms. If
   the group has been pre-selected for their shared view of the world, those
   norms have no means of being challenged. Any and all information which a
   rational, objective person could see would challenge the group’s
   dysfunctional thinking, is reinterpreted by the group as evidence to
   support their thinking. Such delusional reinterpretation of reality is
   common in many mental disorders. When those in power are gripped by group
   think, it can quickly start and continue the madness of war. 

There are no winners

   War almost always emerges as a result of a toxic cocktail of dysfunctional
   psychology. It matters not which side has the most delusional thinking,
   there are no winners in war, only greater or lesser losers. 

   The people who fight wars are the youngest, fittest, and strongest, huge
   numbers of whom are killed in battle. The gene pool is diminished for all.
   After WWI, vast numbers of women could find no husband, and had no
   children. 

   Vast numbers of the soldiers involved in a war have their lives ruined by
   post traumatic stress injury. They suffer nightmares for life, their
   relationships are impaired, holding down a normal career is difficult,
   depression, anxiety, alcoholism, unemployment, homelessness, and suicide
   are all higher in those unlucky enough to have seen the reality of war. 

   Few peoples have avoided paying massive costs for going to war. Are the
   costs of directing a country to go to war borne by those who direct it?
   No. Political systems seem to immunise those who start wars from the
   consequences of their decisions. Perhaps that immunity makes them more
   likely to lay down the lives of others, to protect or enhance their own
   lives and positions.
