                             Children Under Attack

  Children are coming under attack in conflicts across the world. We can’t
  accept this as a ‘new normal.’

   Around the world, attacks on children continue unabated. The number of
   countries experiencing violent conflict is the highest it has been in the
   last 30 years. The result is that more than 30 million children have been
   displaced by conflict. Many of them are being enslaved, trafficked, abused
   and exploited. Many more are living in limbo, without official immigration
   status or access to education and health care. From Afghanistan to Mali,
   to South Sudan, Yemen and beyond, warring parties are flouting one of the
   most basic rules of war: the protection of children.

     Children have become frontline targets. This is a moral crisis of our
     age: We must never accept this as the ‘new normal.’

   To better monitor, prevent, and end attacks against children, the United
   Nations Security Council has identified and condemned six grave violations
   against children in times of war: Killing and maiming of children;
   recruitment or use of children in armed forces and armed groups; attacks
   on schools or hospitals; rape or other grave sexual violence; abduction of
   children; and denial of humanitarian access for children.  

   Between 2005 and 2022, more than 315,000 grave violations were verified
   against children, committed by parties to conflict in more than 30
   conflict situations across Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin
   America. The actual number is undoubtedly far higher.  

Stop attacks on children

   Ultimately children need peace to thrive. It is critical for children that
   efforts to end today’s seemingly endless armed conflicts are redoubled.
   But children cannot wait for protection – while wars continue, we must
   never accept attacks against children.

   More than 30 years since the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of
   the Child, and more than 70 years since the four Geneva Conventions – the
   international legal bedrock to protect civilians in war – it is time to
   say “Enough! Stop attacks on children.”

What we can all do to make change happen

   Citizens everywhere can begin by not averting their gaze from children’s
   suffering, because it seems too distant or the politics of conflict too
   complex.

   We must insist to national and international leaders that protecting
   children during armed conflict is the cornerstone of our shared humanity.

   We must demand leadership which is prepared to act to prevent attacks and
   violence against children trapped in war zones.

   Governments and all warring parties where conflicts rage must act to
   fulfil their obligations to protect children and enable access to
   specialized response services for children affected by violence.

   Communities in conflict-affected areas must be supported to create
   protective environments for girls and boys.

   Governments who support or who have influence over warring parties must
   use all their influence to insist children are protected according to the
   requirements of international law.

   International peace and security institutions such as the United Nations
   Security Council and regional organizations can do more to prioritize the
   safety and well-being of children trapped in armed conflicts.

   The international community can do more to support programmes which work
   to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation, and deliver
   the services needed to help children come through conflict with hope for a
   better future.

   By protecting children from attacks in armed conflict, we keep hope alive,
   we begin to prepare children to shape peaceful futures for themselves and
   their countries. Acting together, we can turn back this deadly ‘new
   normal’ of attacks against children and preserve humanity.

   Children cannot wait. We must act now.

Protecting children from explosive weapons in populated areas

   In conflicts around the world, civilians continue to endure the
   devastating consequences of the use of explosive weapons in populated
   areas (EWIPA). When used in cities, towns and villages, these weapons
   often have effects well beyond their targets. They claim countless lives
   and limbs, cause widespread destruction, and deprive people of essential
   civilian services, such as water and sanitation, electricity, health care
   and education.

   On 18 November 2022, a new political declaration was launched:
   “Strengthening the Protection of Civilians from the Humanitarian
   Consequences Arising from the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated
   Areas.” The declaration, which had been signed by 80 states by 19 November
   2022, sends a strong signal worldwide that harming civilians and damaging
   cities is not a reality we should accept by committing signatory States to
   restrict or refrain from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.

  Emergency funding appeal for children

   Today, there are more children in need of humanitarian assistance than at
   any other time since the Second World War. Across the globe, children are
   facing a historic confluence of crises – from conflict and displacement to
   infectious disease outbreaks and soaring rates of malnutrition.

   More than 400 million children live in areas under conflict; an estimated
   1 billion children – nearly half the world’s children – live in countries
   at extreme vulnerability to the impacts of climate change; at least 36.5
   million children have been displaced from their homes; and 8 million
   children under age 5 across 15 crisis-hit countries are at risk of death
   from severe wasting.

   But the situation is far from hopeless. We know how to reach children at
   greatest risk and in greatest need. Decisive and timely humanitarian
   action can save children’s lives, while also sowing the seeds of future
   development.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Through the Humanitarian Action for Children appeal 2023, UNICEF is
   appealing for US$10.3 billion to reach more than 110 million children with
   humanitarian assistance.

  Humanitarian action for children: Goals for 2023

   In 2023, UNICEF and its partners will continue to provide a principled,
   timely, predictable and efficient humanitarian response in line with
   international norms and standards. UNICEF is also working on strengthening
   the resilience of communities and health infrastructure to withstand
   climate hazards, with the aim of better linking its humanitarian response
   to longer-term community resilience and climate adaptation.

   Gender equality and inclusive programming: In 2023, UNICEF will continue
   to prioritize gender equity in humanitarian action – from preparedness to
   response and recovery.

   Climate in humanitarian action: While much of the global focus is on
   mitigating climate change risk, investment in adaptation measures is
   required immediately to build resilience in a drastically – and rapidly –
   changing environment. UNICEF’s interventions focus on: (1) scaling up
   climate change adaptation models in global operations; (2) advocating and
   engaging in policy development; and (3) prioritizing climate-adaptive
   preparedness efforts as key elements to ensure timely, effective and
   cost-efficient actions to save lives and build resilience. 

   Global food and nutrition crises: UNICEF’s goal is to protect and promote
   diets, services and practices that prevent, detect and treat child
   wasting. UNICEF aims to ensure that no child dies from wasting. UNICEF
   will accelerate progress on two interrelated fronts simultaneously: (1)
   reduce the number of children suffering from the more severe forms of
   wasting; (2) increase the number of children with severe forms of wasting
   who access treatment. 👉🏼 Learn more about severe wasting

   Public health emergencies: The annual number of outbreaks reported to the
   World Health Organization has increased more than threefold since 1980.
   UNICEF is committed to addressing public health emergencies not only
   through emergency coordination and leadership, responding to the health
   threat, but also by working to ensure the continuity of essential
   services.
