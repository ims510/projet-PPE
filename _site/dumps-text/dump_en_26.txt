Ukraine has claimed initiative in Black Sea and forced Russian navy to pull
back, Zelenskiy says

   The president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Thursday that Ukraine had
   seized the initiative from Russia in the Black Sea and forced Russia’s
   naval fleet to pull back in the eastern part of the sea.

   “For the first time in the world, it was in the Black Sea that a fleet of
   naval drones began to operate – a Ukrainian fleet,” Zelenskiy wrote on the
   Telegram.

   “I would also like to note that now – as one of the main results of our
   actions – Russia is unable to use the Black Sea as a springboard to
   destabilise other regions of the world.”

Closing summary

   The Ukraine live blog is coming to a close. Below is a summary of the
   day’s events:

     * Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Ukraine had seized the initiative from
       Russia in the Black Sea and forced Russia’s naval fleet to pull back
       in the eastern part of the sea.

     * The foreign secretary, David Cameron, met the Ukrainian president,
       Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during a trip to Kyiv, pledging continued
       military support and a refocus on Ukraine as conflict continues in the
       Middle East.

     * At least one person was killed and two injured during Russian shelling
       of the southern Ukrainian Kherson region, the local governor Oleksandr
       Prokudin said.

     * The Ukrainian military shot down 16 out of 18 attack drones launched
       by Russia as well as one missile during overnight strikes, Kyiv’s air
       force said.

     * Rescuers cleared rubble from a Russian strike on a residential
       building in the eastern Ukrainian town of Selydove the previous day,
       and one more body was recovered, taking the death toll to three, an
       emergency service said.

     * Russian forces have continued attacks in the contested town of
       Avdiivka in Donetsk oblast, according to the UK’s Ministry of Defence.
       In the latest intelligence update, the MoD said: “Russia is almost
       certainly attempting a pincer movement to encircle the town.”

     * The European Commission has proposed a 12th round of sanctions against
       Moscow, including restrictions on scores of individuals apparently
       including the son of former president Dmitry Medvedev and a relative
       of Vladimir Putin’s.

     * Finland will close four of the nine crossing points on its border with
       Russia to stem a flow of asylum seekers to the Nordic nation, the
       prime minister, Petteri Orpo, said on Thursday.

     * The Kremlin has said that the Czech Republic’s decision to freeze
       Russian state-owned properties was illegal and that Moscow may
       retaliate against what it called a hostile step.

     * The Russian financial watchdog Rosfinmonitoring has placed three
       lawyers for the jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny on a list
       of “terrorists and extremists”.

     * A Russian court has found the artist and musician Alexandra
       Skochilenko guilty of knowingly spreading fake news about the Russian
       army’s behaviour in Ukraine and sentenced her to seven years in a
       prison colony. Amnesty International has declared 33-year-old
       Skochilenko – who replaced supermarket price tags with messages
       calling for an end to Moscow’s war in Ukraine – “a prisoner of
       conscience”.

Russia has sustained casualties of 300,000-400,000, western officials say

   Dan Sabbagh

   Russia has sustained casualties of between 300,000 and 400,000 killed and
   wounded in the war in Ukraine so far, and in the heaviest fighting at
   Avdiivka is losing between 500 and 1,000 a day according to a briefing by
   western officials.

   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, nevertheless
   acknowledged that Ukraine's counter offensive on the Zaporizhzhia front
   has essentially culminated, although "three brigades" are believed to have
   made it across the Dnipro river near Kherson.

   "Neither side is capable of mounting a decisive operation on land," one of
   the officials said, and it appeared that "a prolonged conflict" was likely
   to follow in which long term US and European military aid would be
   crucial.

   A significant force, described as three brigades, had established a
   position across the Dnipro that the Russians have proved unable to
   dislodge, although it was unclear, they said, how much armour the
   Ukrainian military had been able to get across the river.

   But despite the cross-river success, the officials said they expected that
   Ukraine would most likely only be able to make incremental "village at a
   time" progress, a similar pace to summer efforts south of Orikhiv and
   Velyka Novosilka.

   Russia’s state nuclear power corporation has reported that turbine blades
   broke at a plant where the company has installed two reactors of a type it
   is also building in Turkey and plans to construct in Hungary.

   Rosenergoatom, which runs Russia’s nuclear power stations, said it was not
   clear what caused the blades to break, forcing the shutdown of a unit at
   the Leningrad nuclear power plant west of St Petersburg on Sunday.

   “The main thing now is to understand the reason for the destruction of the
   blades. This is a new phenomenon,” said Alexander Shutikov, the head of
   Rosenergoatom. He said repairs should be completed by 22 December.

   The unit where the problem occurred was built in 2018 with a
   next-generation VVER 1200, a pressurised water reactor. Units of this type
   are being built by Russia at the Akkuyu nuclear power plant in Turkey and
   are planned for the Paks-2 plant in Hungary. Russia has already supplied
   them to Belarus.

   Shutikov said the blades that failed were part of a 1,200MW high-speed
   steam turbine. The turbines are produced by the businessman Alexei
   Mordashov’s Power Machines company.

   Power Machines said turbines of the same type had operated without
   problems since 2016 at four power units. It said it was taking all steps
   to restart the affected unit as soon as possible and working with
   specialists from the plant to investigate the causes and identify defects.

   “Based on the results, conclusions will be drawn and compensatory measures
   will be determined,” it said in reply to a request for comment from
   Reuters.

   Rosatom, the parent of Rosenergoatom, said similar turbine models are in
   operation at another unit of the Leningrad plant and in the southern
   Voronezh region. The company said it always investigates and corrects any
   malfunction.

   “Since turbines are not part of the ‘nuclear island’ of the plant, their
   malfunctioning has no impact on nuclear safety, as all reactor equipment
   is functioning as intended,” it said.

   At least one person was killed and two injured during Russian shelling of
   the southern Ukrainian Kherson region, the local governor Oleksandr
   Prokudin said on Thursday.

   “The enemy fire damaged residential buildings and a grocery store. A
   critical infrastructure facility was also destroyed,” Prokudin said on the
   Telegram messaging app, Reuters reports.

   Russian troops abandoned Kherson and the western bank of the Dnipro River
   in the region late last year, but now regularly shell those areas from
   positions on the eastern bank.

   The Guardian could not independently confirm the report.

   appointment.

   As he met Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Cameron pledged that
   long-term British support for Ukraine would continue. The meeting came
   amid concern in Ukraine around global support, with the conflict in the
   Middle East taking attention away from the country, and longer-term
   questions about western financial support as the US heads into an election

   Russian authorities on Wednesday detained two senior employees from
   Carlsberg’s Russian subsidiary, Baltika Breweries, over allegations of
   fraud, and made similar claims against several others, the Danish brewer
   Carlsberg said on Thursday.

   The company said in a statement the allegations were “fake”.

   Moscow in July took control of Carlsberg’s stake in Baltika through a
   presidential decree, saying it would put the foreign-owned stake under
   “temporary management”.

   CEO Jacob Aarup-Andersen last month said Russia had “stolen” its business,
   adding the group had cut all ties with its Russian business and refused to
   enter a deal with Russia’s government that would make its seizure of the
   assets look legitimate.

   “It is appalling that the efforts of the Russian state to justify their
   illegal takeover of our business in Russia has now evolved into targeting
   innocent employees,” Carlsberg said in a statement.

   The Vyborgsky district court on Wednesday ruled that Denis Sherstennikov
   and Anton Rogachevsky be remanded in custody on charges of large-scale
   fraud, accusing them and other unidentified people of having used their
   position at Baltika to transfer some intellectual property rights to
   Carlsberg as the Russian state assumed control of the brewer.

   The two men could not immediately be reached for comment. According to
   their Linkedin profiles, Sherstennikov is CEO of Baltika Breweries and
   Rogachevsky is vice-president, legal.

   “The allegations reported in Russian media are fake,” Carlsberg said.
   Large-scale fraud can carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.

   Police in St Petersburg and Baltika did not immediately respond to
   requests for comment.

   Baltika is suing Carlsberg in Russia, seeking to retain the right to use
   the Danish brewer’s trademarks. On Wednesday, a St Petersburg court
   granted Baltika’s request to hold proceedings behind closed doors, citing
   the need to protect trade secrets, Russian news agencies reported.

   Carlsberg has informed Baltika that the licence agreements enabling it to
   produce, market and sell all Carlsberg Group products, including
   international and regional brands, have been terminated.

   Executives have told Reuters that repercussions for local staff were among
   the top concerns for companies trying to negotiate an exit from Russia.

EU plans fresh Russia sanctions including against son of Dmitry Medvedev

   The European Commission is proposing a 12th round of sanctions against
   Moscow, including restrictions on scores of individuals apparently
   including the son of the former president Dmitry Medvedev and a relative
   of Vladimir Putin’s.

   Among the 47 individuals the commission wants added to existing sanctions
   lists are Putin’s cousin Anna Tsivileva, who chairs the “defenders of the
   fatherland” foundation which supports Russian soldiers fighting in
   Ukraine.

   Also on the extended list is Ilya Medvedev, whose name and date of birth
   match those of the former president’s only son. He is targeted for
   allegedly  orchestrating a disinformation and propaganda campaign in
   Ukraine.

   The inclusion of the relatives of senior officials, including the Putin
   family, will provoke anger in the Kremlin.
