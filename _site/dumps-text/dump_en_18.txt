                         Britain: The Psychology of War

   The War That Changed the World
   [ ]

   What did the world’s first industrial war do to the minds of people who
   fought in it? Amanda Vickery explores the mental motivations and
   psychological impacts of World War One.

   One hundred years ago World War One set the course for the twentieth
   century; for the countries that took part nothing would be the same again.
   In this worldwide series of events with the British Council, we look at
   the impact of the war from around the world.

   The third debate of the series comes from The Imperial War Museum in
   London as we explore the psychology of war. What drove men to volunteer
   for the war? What drove them to the edge of sanity when they got there?

   Historian and broadcaster Amanda Vickery is joined by a panel of experts
   and a live audience to explore the mental impact of fighting the war at
   home and abroad. World War One experts Dan Todman (Queen Mary, University
   of London) and Michael Roper (University of Essex) are joined by the
   celebrated cultural historian, Joanna Bourke (Birkbeck, University of
   London), who presents her specially commissioned essay, Shell Shock and
   the Shock of Shells.
