       Ukraine war: Why Kyiv's Dnipro east bank gain could be significant

   BBC News, Ukraine

   Ukrainian fighters on the front line say troops have not only crossed into
   Russian occupied territory but held a position, apparently for the first
   time, on the fiercely defended east (or left) bank of the Dnipro River in
   Kherson region.

   The development is potentially significant. Ukraine's counteroffensive
   aims to slice through Russian occupied territory, severing a land corridor
   to the Crimean peninsula which Moscow annexed - illegally - in 2014.

   In a text exchange, the 46th brigade told the BBC that troops were engaged
   in heavy fighting as they try to take full control of the village of
   Krynky.

   If successful, the force said, the settlement would give advanced units a
   base from which to launch a larger offensive aimed at dividing Russian
   troops and cutting off their supply lines.

   The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that Ukrainian
   forces were continuing larger than usual ground operations on the east
   bank and Russian military bloggers have also noted fighting in Krynky.

   And the action is being closely scrutinised - success here would be seized
   upon by Ukraine's military chiefs. Their counteroffensive, launched in
   June, has made slow progress, with limited territorial gains.

   But the fighters we spoke to acknowledged that, even if the troops were to
   take Krynky, a modern day "Normandy landings" style attack was unlikely.

   And they gave us a glimpse of the dangers and challenges they face,
   particularly as winter approaches.

   The 46th brigade is fighting further along the vast front line in the
   Zaporizhzhia region with the same aim in mind - to cut off Russian access
   to the Crimean peninsula.

   They told us they had just managed to partially breach the first line of
   Russian defence near the village of Verbove - and that they'd successfully
   targeted some ammunition depots and bases, but that progress was limited.

   They described heavily mined Russian fortifications and daily air attacks
   on their logistics routes without, they complained, air support of their
   own.

   Russian troops, they said, had been on the defensive but were now on the
   attack.

   And, as winter approaches, conditions are deteriorating - for both sides.

   Rainy weather is affecting the work of drones, reconnaissance equipment
   and aviation, the soldiers said. But they did not anticipate any let-up in
   the fighting.

   "Winter will not be a time for respite," they said.
