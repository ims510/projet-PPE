   The four-day ceasefire and hostage agreement tentatively reached between
   Israel and Hamas is a breakthrough following weeks of negotiations
   brokered by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States. Despite this, analysts
   highly doubt this brief truce will lead to a long-lasting ceasefire or any
   significant cessation of hostilities in a war nearing its fiftieth day.

   Reached on Wednesday, the agreement aims to facilitate Hamas’ release of
   50 hostages, civilian women and children, currently held in the Gaza
   Strip, and Israel releasing approximately three times as many Palestinian
   women and children in its prisons.

   Israel has further clarified that it will extend the ceasefire for each
   day Hamas agrees to release an additional 10 hostages it is holding. Hamas
   kidnapped as many as 240 Israeli and foreign civilians from Southern
   Israel during its unprecedented Oct. 7 attack that sparked this present
   war, the deadliest Gaza has ever seen.

   The ceasefire took effect on Friday, with Hamas releasing 24 people and
   Israel freeing 39 Palestinian prisoners.

   President Biden has said “the chances are real” that this pause could lead
   to a longer ceasefire, noting that it’s “only a start, but so far it’s
   gone well.”

   Ryan Bohl, a senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at the risk
   intelligence company RANE, dubbed the truce the “first significant
   diplomatic breakthrough” in this war so far, noting that it means
   humanitarian conditions in Gaza will be “allowed to improved” for at least
   a few days.

   The ceasefire comes amidst a war that has displaced two-thirds of Gaza’s
   2.2 million population, who have limited access to food and water. An
   estimated 200,000 Israelis living in border communities with Gaza and
   Lebanon in the north have also faced displacement since Oct. 7.

   “In terms of what’s next, what we needed to see is a diplomatic process
   that in some form or another will address Israel’s security concerns,
   which are driven by Hamas’s control of the Gaza Strip,” Bohl told me.

   “If this diplomatic process can somehow end Hamas’s control of Gaza, then
   it would preclude the need for further Israeli military operations and
   potentially prevent a full-scale reoccupation of Gaza by the Israeli
   military,” he said.

   However, Bohl underlined that this is “a very difficult scenario” since it
   would require Hamas to “accept a secondary or perhaps even non-existent
   formal role in Gaza” and perhaps even necessitate Israel accepting that it
   might not get all the perpetrators of the Oct. 7 attack.

   Independent Middle East analyst Kyle Orton believes there is “little
   chance” this ceasefire will lead to “a broader cessation of hostilities.”

   “Israel is willing to try anything to get the hostages back, but the
   determination to destroy Hamas remains: after Oct. 7, there is an
   overwhelming consensus within Israel that there can be no security while
   Hamas rules Gaza,” Orton told me.

   Israel’s campaign began shortly after the Hamas attack 49 days ago. So
   far, it has lasted almost as long as the longest Israeli operation against
   Hamas to date, Operation Protective Edge in mid-2014, which lasted 51 days
   but has proven far more deadly for Gaza and its inhabitants.

   While an estimated 2,310 Palestinians lost their lives in that 2014
   operation, an estimated 14,100 have been killed in the present conflict,
   according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It’s presently unclear how many of
   these are Hamas or other militants. The Hamas attack on Israel that
   precipitated this war was also the deadliest in Israel's modern history,
   killing at least 1,200 Israelis, the overwhelming majority of whom were
   civilians.

   “It is possible that we see humanitarian pauses and or a more restrained
   Israeli military campaign going forward to ease humanitarian concerns from
   the United States,” Bohl said. “But broadly, we are likely to see a
   resumption of Israeli military operations in the coming days or weeks in
   order to finish up the ground invasion.”

   “This is in large part because there are no readily viable options that
   address Israel’s security concerns short of this,” he added.

   Both Israel and Hamas made concessions to reach this agreement. Israel had
   previously maintained it wanted all the hostages released, while Hamas was
   insisting it would only trade the hostages for the estimated 6,000
   Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons.

   The two sides have also declared their readiness to resume fighting.

   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the trade a “difficult”
   but “right decision,” vowing that no hostage deal would end the fighting.
   He affirmed Israel will fight on until it meets its stated objectives of
   “eradicating Hamas, bringing all hostages back, and ensuring that in the
   day after Hamas, Gaza won’t threaten Israel.”

   For its part, Hamas declared that “our fingers remain on the trigger” and
   its “victorious fighters will remain on the lookout to defend our people
   and defeat the occupation.”

   Nicholas Heras, senior director of strategy and innovation at the New
   Lines Institute, described the ceasefire deal as “an inflection point” in
   the conflict.

   “The Netanyahu-led government insists that it will not have the IDF
   (Israel Defense Forces) leave Gaza until Hamas is removed from power, but
   there is enormous pressure from Biden on Netanyahu behind the scenes to
   end the conflict as soon as possible,” Heras told me.

   “For these reasons, the ceasefire deal, which is extendable by design,
   could be the start of the runway for Netanyahu to end the war,” he said.

   Netanyahu has previously refused even to contemplate a ceasefire until all
   the hostages were released. However, he has faced mounting pressure at
   home from the hostage families, who recently staged a large march to
   Jerusalem to pressure his government on the matter.

   Orton noted that Netanyahu had no choice but to try any means to get the
   hostages home, given the strong demand among the Israeli public.
   Nevertheless, he believes the Israeli prime minister is “on a hiding to
   nothing” regarding the outcome.

   “If some of the hostages are recovered, this will be seen as no more than
   what he should be doing to correct a mistake of his own making since many
   in Israel blame him for not adequately preparing to prevent the Oct. 7
   pogrom,” he said.

   On the other hand, if it all goes wrong, that will be added to the
   extensive “political indictment” against Netanyahu.

   “If Netanyahu was going to be replaced before the war was over, that would
   probably have already happened,” Orton said. “But if this leads to some
   kind of disaster or if Netanyahu seems to be getting drawn into an
   open-ended ceasefire, the chances of a move against him from within the
   Cabinet increase.”

   Heras doubts the Israeli military leadership will want to cease targeted
   operations and strikes against the Hamas leadership and also wants to
   guarantee Hamas will not run Gaza after this war eventually comes to a
   formal end.

   “This reality, combined with the fact that the top echelon of Hamas
   military leaders in Gaza are still alive and will want to claim victory
   over Israel by surviving beyond the war, means that the situation is on
   the knife’s edge of returning to a full-blown war,” he said.
