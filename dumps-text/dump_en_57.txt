                  Israel-Hamas conflict is the West’s war too

   Patience and tolerance toward a radical ideology that doesn’t recognize
   the legitimacy of your way of life is the greatest enemy of peace and
   coexistence.

   Gideon Sa’ar is a minister in the Israeli Government, a member of the
   Security Cabinet and chairman of the New Hope Party.

   In 2005 Israel withdrew from Gaza. It uprooted every Israeli and every
   community. Every Israeli grave was relocated. All soldiers were withdrawn,
   and military bases shuttered. Israel unilaterally withdrew to the pre-1967
   border.

   Gaza has always been an epicenter of hate, incitement, and terrorism
   against Israel. Since Israel’s withdrawal, instead of choosing prosperity
   and peace, instead of developing Gaza into the Singapore of the Middle
   East, Hamas and Islamic Jihad decided to use the entity as a launching pad
   for their armies to wage their war against Israel.

   In the past decades and elsewhere in the Middle East (Lebanon, Yemen and
   others), Islamist terrorists have taken control and created “terror
   states” that operate and function completely differently from normal
   sovereign states.

   They’re not just a “terrorist organization” acting within the territory of
   another country. They control every aspect of the territory they occupy
   and exploit resources and civilian populations for their war effort. This
   is the phenomenon of a terrorist state.

   The barbarous attacks of Hamas on October 7 against Israeli civilians were
   an act of state madness, aside from the utter immorality of mass murder
   and rape. It is not rational to start an all-out war against a much
   stronger country. But their rationale is different. It is fanatical.

   To grasp the antisemitic and psychotic state of mind of this movement, it
   is enough to read Hamas’s founding charter.

   According to Hamas, the murder of Jews is a religious commandment.
   According to the charter, Jews, in their minds, are responsible for every
   war or destructive historical event, including those where Jews themselves
   were victims. Among the events, the French Revolution, the Communist
   Revolution, the First and Second World Wars, the founding of the League of
   Nations (to control the world), and the establishment of the UN.

   In their eyes the entire land of Israel is sacred to Muslims until the
   resurrection of the dead and therefore nobody has the authority to
   relinquish any part of it whatsoever.

   To try and legitimize the barbaric massacre that took place on October 7
   is as absurd as trying to find justification for the perverse, murderous
   attack by al-Qaeda against the U.S. on September 11 2001. It’s the same
   madness, the same extremism, the same cruel murderousness.

   The reason for the attack on Israel was simple: Hamas wants to destroy the
   state of Israel. Hamas’ conflict with Israel is not a territorial one, it
   is a total ideological one.

   Since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, radical Islam has become an ideological
   rival of the democratic West. Radical Islam totally rejects Western values
   and wants to destroy Western civilization — so much for Francis Fukuyama’s
   theory of “the end of history.”

   Strategically, as it did on September 11, or during terror attacks
   inspired, encouraged and sometimes organized in European cities, radical
   Islam always seeks to attack people as well as nations on their own soil
   and in their own homes. It’s an attempt to undermine a sense of safety and
   security and to instil fear. Hamas’ charter states that no one will enjoy
   peace and security unless under the control of Islam.

   There is only one way to deal with terror states. Total war that ends with
   the destruction of the regime and its military capabilities — like the war
   the United States led against ISIS or like the Second World War. Truth be
   told, you cannot wipe out an ideology — after all, there are still Nazis
   in the world. But the danger they pose today is different from the Nazi
   regime.

   Radical ideologies are far more dangerous when they control or form a
   state, or a territorial caliphate. That is why the United States, along
   with its allies in the Middle East and Europe, decided it couldn’t allow
   Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s Islamic State to persist. The same goes for Hamas.

   During the nine-month-long battle for Mosul, the world saw ISIS use
   thousands of people as human shields. Thousands were kidnapped and
   executed who didn’t want to be human shields. ISIS terrorists shot
   civilians who sought to flee to safety. Hamas operates in the same way.

   The Hamas terrorist, in some cases, is less than one mile from where our
   citizens were butchered, beheaded, and cold-heartedly slaughtered. But
   make no mistake, Israel is the West’s frontline in the Middle East —
   Israel is certainly not the end game as far as radical Islam is concerned.
   And Israel’s war against radical Islam is also the West’s war — even if it
   refuses to acknowledge that.

   Israel is grateful to the United States, to its people and the
   administration led by President Joe Biden for unwavering friendship that
   is once again standing up to the test. But the loss of moral clarity and
   compass in some of America’s top university campuses is extremely
   concerning — so too are the pro-Hamas protests in American and European
   cities with participants baying for the destruction of the Jewish state.

   Israel has no choice but to inflict an absolute defeat on Hamas. This war
   comes after six previous military rounds when Israel didn’t utilize its
   full might against Hamas. Since 2007, when Hamas seized control of Gaza,
   Israeli citizens have been subjected time and again to constant rocket,
   missile, and mortar fire on their homes.

   The war being waged by radical Islam against the West and its values is
   only at its start. Al-Qaeda, ISIS and Hamas are the opening chapters in a
   war against the West and its values. In fact, radical Islam already has a
   grip on many European cities.

   It is imperative for the West to learn an important lesson that Israel
   knew in the past and unfortunately forgot in recent times: It is better to
   fight your enemy on their territory rather than wait for them to come to
   you.

   Patience and tolerance towards a radical ideology that doesn’t recognize
   the legitimacy of your way of life is the greatest enemy of peace and
   coexistence. If the Western way of life is important and meaningful, then
   there must be a willingness to stand up and fight for it against its foes.

   Israel’s war against Hamas is crucial to the safety and security of its
   citizens but not only to them. It is also vital to the security of the
   democratic West and to the United States.
