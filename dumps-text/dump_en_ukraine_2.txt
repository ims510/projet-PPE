   Zelensky: Thousands of children abducted by Russia

   By James Landale in New York & Jaroslav Lukiv in London
   BBC News

   "Evil cannot be trusted," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has told
   the UN General Assembly, as he urged the world to unite to end Russian
   aggression against his country.

   In a passionate speech in New York, Mr Zelensky said a nuclear-armed
   Moscow must be stopped from "pushing the world to the final war".

   He also accused Russia of weaponising everything from food to energy.

   Russia's full-scale invasion has prompted widespread condemnation.

   In a speech which focused heavily on the danger Russia poses to the world,
   he argued that other common challenges such as climate change can only be
   properly addressed after Moscow had been pushed back.

   "While Russia is pushing the world to the final war, Ukraine is doing
   everything to ensure that after the Russian aggression no-one in the world
   will dare to attack any nation," Mr Zelensky said to world leaders
   attending the annual General Assembly.

   He also said Russia simply had "no right to hold nuclear weapons".

   "Weaponisation must be restrained, war crimes must be punished, deported
   people must come back home, and the occupier must return to their own
   land.

   "We must be united to make it, and we will do it!" Mr Zelensky said.

   He also accused Moscow of carrying out "genocide" by abducting Ukrainian
   children.

   In March, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant
   for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the alleged unlawful deportation
   of Ukrainian children to Russia.

   Moscow has repeatedly denied Ukraine's accusations - but a number
   international experts and organisations point to a growing evidence that
   Russia has committed war crimes in Ukraine.

   The Ukrainian president went on to warn against "shady deals" to try to
   end the war - the biggest in Europe since World War Two - on unfair terms.

   But his key point was to warn the international community that the outcome
   of the war would affect everyone.

   Russia's goal, he said, was to turn Ukraine into "a weapon against you,
   against the rules-based international order".

   The peace formula that he had been outlining for months was, he said, not
   just for Ukraine, but also the rest of the world.

   So the pitch was clear and aimed squarely at countries - many of them in
   the so-called "Global South" including Brazil and India - which have thus
   far stayed on the sidelines.

   A number of nations have even strengthened their economic ties with the
   Kremlin.

   Western powers have been rushing around the UN trying to address those
   countries' wider concerns about development issues and climate change.

   Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian leader applauded Joe Biden's speech, in
   which his US counterpart warned of grave consequences if Russia's
   aggression was not stopped.

   "Russia believes that the world will grow weary and allow it to brutalise
   Ukraine without consequence. If we allow Ukraine to be carved up, is the
   independence of any nation secure?" Mr Biden said.

   Meanwhile, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi - whose country has provided
   combat drones to Russia and is seen as Moscow's key ally - accused
   Washington of escalating the war in Ukraine.

   "The United States of America has fanned the flames of violence in Ukraine
   in order to weaken the European countries. This is a long-term plan,
   unfortunately," he told the gathering in New York.
