The Israel-Hamas War: The Humanitarian Crisis in Gaza

   Calls for a cease-fire are rising worldwide as the war between Israel
   and Hamas further exacerbates the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

   On October 7, the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a massive
   surprise assault on southern Israel, the deadliest single attack on
   Israelis in history. Israel’s subsequent declaration of war against
   Hamas has further worsened an already dire situation in the Gaza Strip,
   where more than two million Palestinians live. As the violence
   escalates, some injured civilians and foreign nationals in Gaza have
   been able to leave the territory during short “humanitarian pauses,”
   but international appeals for a full cease-fire are persisting as the
   war’s death toll mounts.

   Gaza, a small territory of about 139 square miles (360 square
   kilometers), or roughly the size of the city of Detroit, was already
   experiencing a severe humanitarian crisis before the current
   hostilities broke out. As a result of a sixteen-year blockade by
   Israel, about 95 percent of the population cannot access clean water,
   while more than half of all Gazans depend on international assistance
   for basic services. Additionally, some 80 percent of Gaza’s residents
   are considered refugees under international law, and Palestinians
   overall compose the largest stateless community in the world.

   Since Hamas’s attack, the situation in Gaza has become a “catastrophe,”
   UN Secretary-General António Guterres said. According to the
   Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry, as of November 10, Israel’s
   retaliation has killed at least 11,070 people, two-thirds of them women
   and children, while some 2,650 others have been reported missing. These
   figures could not be independently verified, but outside sources have
   also put the death numbers in the thousands. At least forty journalists
   and media workers have also been killed, as well as more than one
   hundred UN employees. Hamas’s assault killed around 1,200 Israelis,
   around 70 percent of them civilians.

   Israel has imposed a complete siege of the territory, cutting off
   electricity and water, and supplies of food and medicine are dwindling
   fast. Without fuel, meanwhile, Gaza’s only power station has gone dark.
   The lack of electricity has shut down desalination and waste-water
   treatment plants, further compromising access to safe drinking water.
   Israeli air strikes have destroyed neighborhoods, schools, and mosques,
   though the Israeli military has said that it is only targeting weapons
   storage centers and infrastructure used or occupied by Hamas militants.
   However, Israeli air strikes targeting residential buildings and
   medical facilities have resulted in numerous civilian casualties.

   By the second week of November, Gaza’s health system was reported to
   have collapsed, with hospitals running low on rationed fuel reserves
   and medical supplies. Northern Gaza’s two major hospitals have already
   greatly exceeded capacity, and hospitals in the south are also
   overflowing. Beginning in November, Israeli strikes have targeted
   al-Shifa Hospital, the largest and best-equipped hospital in Gaza.
   Israeli officials claim Hamas has a command center beneath the
   facility. Meanwhile, a dispute between Israel and health authorities in
   Gaza over a potential fuel delivery has delayed fuel from reaching the
   hospital, from which thousands of people have fled. Israel’s energy
   minister said on October 12 that electricity, fuel, and water would not
   be provided to Gaza until all hostages—totaling roughly 240 people—held
   by Hamas are freed.

What are the refuge options for Palestinians in Gaza?

   On October 13, Israel ordered more than one million people living in
   northern Gaza to evacuate to the south within twenty-four hours, ahead
   of an expected ground invasion targeting Hamas. The United Nations
   called on Israel to rescind the order, saying it would be “impossible”
   to achieve without “devastating humanitarian consequences.” As of
   November 10, more than 1.6 million people, or over half of Gaza’s
   population, had been displaced.

   Gazans’ options for refuge are limited. Israel has closed its two
   border crossings with Gaza as part of its blockade. Egypt, which shares
   the Rafah border crossing with Gaza and already hosts more than 350,000
   refugees and asylum seekers [PDF], is the only viable outlet left.
   Though the Egyptian government was initially reluctant to open the
   crossing, it has since done so to allow aid trucks carrying water,
   food, and medical supplies to enter Gaza. (However, UN officials say
   the daily quota for deliveries is only a fraction of what is required
   to meet Gaza’s urgent needs.) Some foreign nationals and injured
   civilians have also been allowed to flee Gaza via the border
   crossing, which has temporarily closed several times due to Israeli
   strikes.

   With food, fuel, and water supplies rapidly dwindling, the United
   States is working with the United Nations and other international aid
   organizations to create “safe zones” [PDF] within Gaza where civilians
   can receive urgent humanitarian aid.

How are humanitarian aid organizations responding?

   In November, the United Nations launched an updated $481 million flash
   appeal to address the needs of people in Gaza and the West Bank. In
   Gaza, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and UN Relief and Works Agency
   for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) are helping to provide
   essential goods and services, such as medical supplies, fuel, and
   emergency assistance. Several other major organizations, including the
   International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement—which comprises the
   Palestine Red Crescent Society—and Doctors Without Borders, are also
   supplying humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict. As the
   fighting continues, international calls for humanitarian pauses have
   grown, including from countries in the European Union and the Group of
   Seven (G7), while members of the Arab League have pushed for a complete
   cease-fire.
