   Zelensky: Thousands of children abducted by Russia
   By James Landale in New York & Jaroslav Lukiv in London
   BBC News

   "Evil cannot be trusted," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has
   told the UN General Assembly, as he urged the world to unite to end
   Russian aggression against his country.

   In a passionate speech in New York, Mr Zelensky said a nuclear-armed
   Moscow must be stopped from "pushing the world to the final war".

   He also accused Russia of weaponising everything from food to energy.

   Russia's full-scale invasion has prompted widespread condemnation.

   In a speech which focused heavily on the danger Russia poses to the
   world, he argued that other common challenges such as climate change
   can only be properly addressed after Moscow had been pushed back.

   "While Russia is pushing the world to the final war, Ukraine is doing
   everything to ensure that after the Russian aggression no-one in the
   world will dare to attack any nation," Mr Zelensky said to world
   leaders attending the annual General Assembly.

   He also said Russia simply had "no right to hold nuclear weapons".

   "Weaponisation must be restrained, war crimes must be punished,
   deported people must come back home, and the occupier must return to
   their own land.

   "We must be united to make it, and we will do it!" Mr Zelensky said.

   He also accused Moscow of carrying out "genocide" by abducting
   Ukrainian children.

   In March, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest
   warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the alleged unlawful
   deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia.

   Moscow has repeatedly denied Ukraine's accusations - but a number
   international experts and organisations point to a growing evidence
   that Russia has committed war crimes in Ukraine.

   The Ukrainian president went on to warn against "shady deals" to try to
   end the war - the biggest in Europe since World War Two - on unfair
   terms.

   But his key point was to warn the international community that the
   outcome of the war would affect everyone.

   Russia's goal, he said, was to turn Ukraine into "a weapon against you,
   against the rules-based international order".

   The peace formula that he had been outlining for months was, he said,
   not just for Ukraine, but also the rest of the world.

   So the pitch was clear and aimed squarely at countries - many of them
   in the so-called "Global South" including Brazil and India - which have
   thus far stayed on the sidelines.

   A number of nations have even strengthened their economic ties with the
   Kremlin.

   Western powers have been rushing around the UN trying to address those
   countries' wider concerns about development issues and climate change.

   Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian leader applauded Joe Biden's speech,
   in which his US counterpart warned of grave consequences if Russia's
   aggression was not stopped.

   "Russia believes that the world will grow weary and allow it to
   brutalise Ukraine without consequence. If we allow Ukraine to be carved
   up, is the independence of any nation secure?" Mr Biden said.

   Meanwhile, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi - whose country has provided
   combat drones to Russia and is seen as Moscow's key ally - accused
   Washington of escalating the war in Ukraine.

   "The United States of America has fanned the flames of violence in
   Ukraine in order to weaken the European countries. This is a long-term
   plan, unfortunately," he told the gathering in New York.
