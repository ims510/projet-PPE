Europe

Russian losses in Ukraine have wiped out its advantage in Baltics, report
says

   STUTTGART, Germany — Russia’s battlefield losses in Ukraine have
   eliminated the military advantages it once held over NATO allies in the
   Baltic region, a new think tank report says.

   “Russia has effectively lost its position of power and the capacity to
   threaten its neighbors with projections of military power,” Pavel Baev
   wrote in a November report for the French Institute of International
   Relations.

   Baev, a longtime Russia expert who once worked at a research institute
   inside the Soviet Union’s defense ministry, argues many Western policy
   planners haven’t grasped the long-term implications of what the war in
   Ukraine means for security in the Baltics.

   While some in the West see Russia’s weakened position as transitional
   and a Russian comeback inevitable, Moscow sees the loss of its
   conventional military edge in the Baltics as “both unacceptable and
   irreversible,” Baev said.

   The Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were annexed by the
   Soviet Union during World War II. Since becoming independent in the
   1990s, their forces always have been far smaller and less developed
   than Russia’s.

   However, they have welcomed training with U.S. troops and other NATO
   allies, which are required to collectively defend the Baltic nations if
   they are attacked, in line with the alliance’s treaty.

   up rotations of other combat forces in the region.

   Russia’s war in Ukraine has taken an extreme toll on its military and
   challenges its ability to maintain a large force on its western flank
   with NATO, the report said. The study argues that Moscow’s strategic
   goal of turning its military exclave of Kaliningrad into a launching
   pad to dominate the central part of the Baltic region “has effectively
   been canceled.”

   Moreover, Ukraine’s ability to target Russian military infrastructure
   around Crimea has exposed weaknesses in Russia’s coastal defense weapon
   systems. Those vulnerabilities also apply to the Russian military along
   the Baltic coast.

   Beyond the tactical weaknesses, Russian capabilities were compromised
   as assets moved to the war front. Many of the Baltic units tasked with
   guarding Russia’s western border with NATO countries have been
   decimated during the nearly two years of fighting in Ukraine, according
   to the report, which cites a lengthy list of damaged units.

   “Whatever the scope of the outcome of the war, Russia will not be able
   to rebuild a position of military superiority in the Baltic theater or
   even to set an approximate balance of forces with NATO, which is
   implementing a new plan to strengthen its posture in this reconfigured
   direction,” Baev said.

   Moscow could be forced to rely more on long-range missiles and talk up
   its nuclear capability for deterrence purposes, to make up for its
   conventional military disadvantages.

   “Plain strategic logic dictates that weakness of conventional forces
   necessitates greater reliance on nuclear capabilities, and the Baltic
   theater may see applications of this logic,” the report says.

   Regardless of the outcome of the war, Russia also will need to position
   forces along its southern border with Ukraine for the long-haul, the
   report says.

   For years, the Baltics have been a focal point for the American-led
   NATO alliance, which has strengthened its position in the region amid
   concerns that it was outgunned by Russia. Many of the alliance’s
   changes were prompted by Russia’s initial 2014 intervention in Ukraine,
   which shattered old post-Cold War assumptions about a more secure
   Europe.

   In the years before 2014, many NATO militaries drastically reduced
   defense spending, shrunk the sizes of their militaries and regarded the
   prospect of large-scale conflict on the European continent as an
   anachronism.

   The U.S. military also sharply scaled back on the Continent, removing
   the last of its battle tanks from Europe just months before Russia’s
   annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula.

   The diminished NATO force prompted angst among security analysts at the
   time. Those concerns were reinforced by a large war game, carried out
   by the Rand Corp. think tank with the assistance of numerous American
   military commands between 2014 and 2015.

   It found a Russian offensive in the Baltics would overwhelm
   lesser-armed alliance forces and seize the Estonian and Latvian
   capitals in a matter of hours.

   The Rand war game, which garnered much attention at the time, said “the
   outcome was, bluntly, a disaster for NATO.”

   Since then, NATO has added multinational battlegroups in the Baltics
   and Poland and ramped up rotations of other combat forces in the
   region, including U.S. Army tank units.

   That, along with the addition of Finland into NATO and eventually
   Sweden, tipped the balance in the Baltics to NATO’s favor, Baev said.

   “With the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO, the Baltic theater
   is reconfigured so profoundly to Russia’s disadvantage that no amount
   of effort could make ‘Fortress Kaliningrad’ defensible,” the report
   said.
