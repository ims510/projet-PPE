   Israel's Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi submitted a proposal to take
   action against Haaretz by ending the publication of government notices in
   Haaretz. Karhi, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud
   party, said the newspaper was "sabotaging Israel in wartime" and was an
   "inflammatory mouthpiece for Israel’s enemies."

   The proposal, which was submitted without being vetted by the ministry's
   legal adviser, would immediately halt any payments to Haaretz from any
   state entity within his purview.

   Haaretz publisher Amos Schocken responded to Karhi’s proposal by saying,
   “If the government wants to close Haaretz, that’s the time to read
   Haaretz.”

   Karhi's proposal, which would forbid the publication of official
   government notices in Haaretz, and would cancel all state employee Haaretz
   subscriptions – including those held by members of the IDF, the police,
   the prison service, government ministries and government companies – was
   sent to Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs.

   In a letter to Fuchs entitled, “Taking action against the Haaretz
   newspaper for the dissemination of lying, defeatist propaganda,” Karhi
   wrote: “Since the beginning of the war, I have received many complaints
   that Haaretz has taken an offensive line which undermines the war's goals
   and disparages the military effort and its social fortitude. It is
   possible that some of the paper's publications even cross the criminal
   standard set in those far-flung sections of the penal code reserved for
   wartime only.”

   Karhi added: “The State of Israel is one of Haaretz’s customers, and the
   government has the power to decide that it isn’t interested in being a
   customer of a newspaper that is sabotaging Israel in wartime and
   undermining the spirit of Israeli soldiers and civilians in the face of
   the enemy.” He noted he was still waiting for his ministry's legal adviser
   to offer an opinion regarding his proposal, “and I don’t know what it will
   be.”

   The Israeli journalists’ union said in a statement that “the
   communications minister has lost his way. Karhi, who spent most of his
   brief tenure in failed attempts to close the public broadcasting
   corporation, has decided to tame a new target. His new proposal to end all
   government business with Haaretz is a populistic proposal devoid of any
   feasibility or logic, and its entire purpose is to garner likes among his
   political base at the expense of dedicated journalists who are working
   night and day right now to cover the war."

   “We support Haaretz’s journalists, and we’re certain they will continue to
   do important work for the benefit of Israel and won’t be deterred by
   Minister Karhi’s stupid, empty threats,” it added.

   In his letter, Karhi cited the recently approved emergency regulations
   that allow the government to take action against foreign media outlets
   that harm the country.

   “It’s inconceivable that at a time when we are taking action against
   foreign stations, an Israeli newspaper should continue to get a
   significant share of its funding from the Israeli public while it serves
   as an inflammatory mouthpiece for Israel’s enemies,” he wrote.

   The security cabinet recently authorized Karhi to take action under these
   regulations against Al Mayadeen, a Lebanese television station affiliated
   with Hezbollah that also reports from Israel, on the grounds that it harms
   national security and serves a terrorist organization. Karhi subsequently
   signed an order blocking the station’s internet channel in Israel and
   asked the army to issue a closure order for its offices in the West Bank.

   However, the cabinet refused to approve his request to close the Qatari
   station Al Jazeera, in part because of Qatar’s involvement in negotiations
   for the release of the hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

   Prominent journalists from around the world have denounced Karhi's
   threats. CNN's Jake Tapper tweeted: "A push to undermine the free press
   from the Netanyahu government." The Nation's Jeet Heer wrote: "Haaretz is
   a great newspaper, needed now more than ever." Yashar Ali, who writes for
   the Huffington Post and the New York Magazine, wrote in response: "I just
   subscribed."
