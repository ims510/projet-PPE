IDF confirms released hostages are inside Israel

   The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have confirmed that the Israeli
   hostages freed from Gaza are now in Israel and have undergone medical
   checks.

   A statement from the IDF reads:

     The released hostages underwent an initial medical assessment inside
     Israeli territory. They will continue to be accompanied by IDF
     soldiers as they make their way to Israeli hospitals, where they
     will be reunited with their families.

   Axios’ Barak Ravid has shared the full IDF statement in English:

Closing summary

   It’s turned 7.15am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv and we’ll close this blog
   in a moment. Our live coverage of the Israel-Hamas war will resume
   soon, and in the meantime you can see all our coverage here. Here’s
   where things stand.
     * The first group of hostages were released by Hamas – 13 Israelis,
       10 Thais and a Philippine national – on Friday. The 13 Israelis,
       who included very young children and older women, had reached their
       home country by early evening. The Thai ministry said it “will do
       all possible to expedite” the return of their nationals to
       Thailand. Israel has received a list of hostages who are expected
       to be released by Hamas on Saturday, Israeli prime minister
       Benjamin Netanyahu’s office says.
     * Thirty-nine Palestinian prisoners were released by Israel on Friday
       evening. They consisted of 24 women, including some convicted of
       attempted murder for attacks on Israeli forces, and 15 teenagers
       jailed for offences such as throwing stones. Celebrations have been
       taking place in the occupied West Bank following their release.
     * The hostage release came as part of a deal that has brought about a
       temporary pause in hostilities, with the four-day ceasefire marking
       the first break in seven weeks of war in Gaza. Under the agreement,
       Hamas is due to free at least 50 of the about 240 mostly Israeli
       hostages it has held since launching attacks into southern Israel
       on 7 October in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed.
       In return, Israel will release at least 150 Palestinian prisoners
       and allow up to 300 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
     * The families of the 10 Thai hostages released on Friday had been
       notified, Thailand’s ministry of foreign affairs said, and the
       group was now with officials from the Thai embassy. The ministry
       also said there were now an estimated 20 Thai nationals who were
       still being held in Gaza.
     * US president Joe Biden said the chances were “real” that a
       temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be extended.
       Biden said Friday’s hostage release was the “start of a process”
       and that he “will not stop” until all remaining hostages in Gaza
       were brought home. The deal reached by Israel and Hamas involved
       “extensive US diplomacy”, he said, adding: “It’s only a start, but
       so far it’s gone well.” Biden also said he expected American
       citizens to be among the hostages who would be released.
     * Most of the Israeli hostages released by Hamas were said to be in
       good health after returning to Israel, the hospital receiving them
       announced. Schneider Children’s hospital, where four women and four
       child hostages were released, said doctors had conducted a
       preliminary examination and said they were all in in good physical
       condition.
     * Some 137 trucks of goods were offloaded by the UN agency for
       Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reception point in the Gaza Strip on
       Friday. The UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs
       said it was “the biggest humanitarian convoy received” in Gaza
       since 7 October. In addition, 129,000 litres of fuel and four
       trucks of gas also crossed into Gaza, it said.
     * Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos said on X that he was
       “overjoyed” to confirm that a Filipino, Gelienor “Jimmy” Pacheco,
       was among the first group of hostages released on Friday. Pacheco
       was working as a carer when he was captured by Hamas during the 7
       October attacks.
     * The World Health Organisation has voiced concern about the fate of
       the head of Gaza City’s al-Shifa hospital, whom Israeli forces
       detained over the facility’s alleged use by Hamas.
     * Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters are expected to
       gather in London for the latest demonstration calling for a
       permanent ceasefire in Gaza. The Metropolitan police will be on
       high alert and about 1,500 officers will be deployed for the
       protests on Saturday.
     * The Israeli offensive on Gaza has killed more than 14,000 people,
       thousands of them children, according to Palestinian officials.
       More are thought to be buried under rubble. At least 1,200 people,
       mostly civilians, were killed in the Hamas attacks on 7 October,
       and more than 240 people taken hostage.

   The war is paused, but it is not over.

   There will be relief at the promised four days of quiet between Israel
   and Hamas, and there will be joy for the families waiting to be
   reunited with loved ones, thanks to Friday’s exchange of hostages held
   in Gaza for prisoners held in Israel.

   But even if the ceasefire is extended, perhaps in return for the
   release of more Hamas-held captives, this war will not be over anytime
   soon. If anything, it is likely to intensify.

   It is too big to stop now, it runs too deep. And it has already turned
   Israel upside down.

   You only have to spend a few days in the country to see that. The war
   is everywhere.

   In case you missed this earlier, Jonathan Freedland has spoken to
   survivors, displaced people and senior political and military figures
   about life in Israel before and after 7 October, and considers the
   longer-term ramifications:

WHO concerned for arrested al-Shifa hospital chief

   The World Health Organisation has voiced concern about the fate of the
   head of Gaza City’s al-Shifa hospital, whom Israeli forces detained
   over the facility’s alleged use by Hamas.

   The WHO said in a statement that the chief of the Gaza Strip’s biggest
   hospital, Mohammad Abu Salmiya, had been arrested on Wednesday along
   with five other health workers while they were taking part in a UN
   mission to evacuate patients, Agence France-Presse reports.

   “Three medical personnel from the Palestine Red Crescent Society and
   three from the ministry of health were detained,” the WHO said.

   Since then two of the six have reportedly been released, but “we do not
   have information about the well-being of the four remaining health
   staff, including the director of al-Shifa hospital”, the statement
   added.

   The UN agency called for “their legal and human rights to be fully
   observed during their detention”.

   A spokesperson for the Israeli army said on Saturday that Abu Salmiya
   was being questioned. Doron Spielman said:

     We are currently moving forward with... questioning him over the
     fact that he was the head of a hospital that was really sitting on
     top of an entire terror network.

     How could he not know what’s happening? We have hostages that were
     on, you know, CCTV in his hospital.

   The Israeli army, which raided the hospital last week, has alleged
   Hamas fighters used a tunnel complex beneath the facility. Hamas and
   hospital officials have repeatedly denied the claims.

   During the WHO’s latest mission to the hospital on Wednesday – carried
   out in cooperation with the Palestine Red Crescent – 151 people were
   evacuated, including patients, their relatives and healthcare workers,
   according to the WHO.

Israel reviews list of Hamas hostages to be freed on Saturday

   Israel has received a list of hostages set to be freed by Hamas from
   Gaza on Saturday, Israeli officials said, following the release of 24
   hostages on Friday – the first of a planned four-day ceasefire.

   Reuters reports that Israeli security officials were reviewing the
   list, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement,
   after his government’s vow to work for the release of all hostages
   taken by Hamas in the militant group’s attack on southern Israel on 7
   October.

   The pause in the fighting was the first such break, with both sides
   saying hostilities would resume as soon as the truce ends. US president
   Joe Biden, however, expressed hope the pause could be extended.

   The released hostages, including Israeli women and children and Thai
   farm workers, were transferred from Gaza and handed to Egyptian
   authorities at the Rafah border crossing, along with eight staff of the
   International Committee of the Red Cross in a four-car convoy, the
   organisation said.

   They were then taken to Israel for medical checks and reunions with
   relatives.

Twenty Thais still captive in Gaza, says Thailand, after 10 freed

   Thailand’s ministry of foreign affairs said the families of the 10 Thai
   hostages released by Hamas on Friday had been notified, and the group
   was now with officials from the Thai embassy.

   The ministry said in a statement.

     This group will stay in the hospital for at least 48 hours, while
     RTE [the royal Thai embassy] will make all the necessary
     arrangements for their travel back to Thailand and their families as
     soon as possible.

   The ministry has confirmed that 10 Thai hostages were released on
   Friday, not 12 as was initially suggested by Thai authorities.

     confirmed as hostages) pic.twitter.com/Eb6PDvc4dY
     — Rebecca Ratcliffe (@rebeccarat) November 25, 2023

   The ministry also said there were now an estimated 20 Thai nationals
   who were still being held in Gaza. It was previously thought that at
   least 26 Thai nationals had been abducted, including the 10 people
   recently released. However, of the group of 10 released on Friday, four
   had not previously been confirmed as hostages.

   The ministry thanked all governments and organisations who helped to
   secure Friday’s release, saying:

     The Thai government would like to express, once again, its deepest
     appreciation to all of the parties from whom the Thai authorities
     had sought assistance and support, such as the governments of Qatar,
     Israel, Egypt, Iran, Malaysia and the ICRC [International Committee
     of the Red Cross], as well as others involved in the immense efforts
     that led to this recent release.

     We sincerely hope that the remaining hostages will be treated
     humanely and released safely as soon as possible.

Ferdinand Marcos 'overjoyed' at Filipino's release

   Rebecca Ratcliffe
   Rebecca Ratcliffe

   Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos has said on X that he is
   “overjoyed” to confirm that a Filipino, Gelienor “Jimmy” Pacheco, was
   among the first group of hostages released on Friday.
   Pacheco was working as a carer when he was captured by Hamas during the
   7 October attacks.
   Marcos added:

     He is now safely in the custody of officials in our Israel Embassy.
     I salute the work of the Philippine Foreign Service in securing his
     release, and once again thank the State of Qatar for their
     invaluable assistance in making Jimmy’s release possible.

   Marcos said the search for a second missing person continued.

     We remain concerned over the whereabouts of our other national, Ms
     Noralyn Babadilla, and are sparing no effort to locate and secure
     her if she is indeed found to be one of the hostages. We pray for
     the continued success of the truce and for all hostages to be
     released.

     I am overjoyed to confirm that a Filipino, Mr. Gelienor “Jimmy”
     Pacheco, was among the first group of 24 hostages released by the
     Hamas yesterday.
     He is now safely in the custody of officials in our Israel Embassy.
     I salute the work of the Philippine Foreign Service in…

   The Metropolitan police said officers would hand out leaflets to
   provide “absolute clarity” on what would be deemed at Saturday’s
   pro-Palestinian rally in London, where tens of thousands are expected
   to call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.

   Deputy assistant commissioner Ade Adelekan said:

     This sets out that anyone who is racist or incites hatred against
     any group should expect to be arrested. As should anyone who
     supports Hamas or any other banned organisation.

   Organisers Stop the War coalition said such a measure was “intrusive”
   but asked anyone attending to avoid “any actions that might leave you
   or others around you open to arrest”.

   The afternoon will also see a protest by Hizb-ut-Tahrir outside the
   Egyptian embassy. It is the first by the group since 21 October, after
   a video emerged showing a man chanting “jihad”, prompting an outcry
   from politicians.

   A march organised by the charity Campaign Against Antisemitism is also
   due to take place on Sunday, with about 40,000 to 50,000 people
   expected to attend.

London police on high alert over major pro-Palestinian protest

   Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters are expected to gather
   in London for the latest demonstration calling for a permanent
   ceasefire in Gaza.

   PA Media reports that about 1,500 officers will be deployed for the
   protests, which come amid the temporary truce in the war and Hamas’
   release of 24 hostages, along with Israel’s release of 39 Palestinian
   prisoners.

   The Metropolitan police will be on high alert in the capital, after a
   previous rally on Armistice Day saw scenes of violent disorder after
   counter-protesters clashed with officers.

   The Met had come under severe pressure from politicians over the
   decision to allow that march to go ahead, with former home secretary
   Suella Braverman accusing the force of showing bias in favour of
   leftwing protesters.

   About 100,000 people are expected to march on Saturday from Park Lane
   to Whitehall, as organisers rejected the label of “hate march” deployed
   by Braverman before she was sacked by prime minister Rishi Sunak.

   Most of the Israeli hostages released by Hamas were said to be in good
   health after returning to Israel, the hospital receiving them
   announced.

   A statement from Schneider Children’s hospital, where four women and
   four child hostages were released, said doctors had conducted a
   preliminary examination and said they were all in in good physical
   condition, Associated Press reports.

   A total of 13 Israeli hostages were freed on Friday and transferred to
   three separate hospitals across Israel. Thirty-nine Palestinian
   prisoners were released by Israel on Friday evening.

   Reuters has posted a video report on displaced Palestinians in Gaza
   saying they’re not being allowed to return north as the Israel-Hamas
   ceasefire continues.

   A man beside a road in Khan Younis, in the territory’s south, says in
   the video, posted on X (formerly Twitter):

     They didn’t let us go back to Gaza City to see our children. They’re
     young and don’t know their way ... No one knows what to do or how we
     will bring them back.

     We are poor people, I got them food to eat. Our hearts are aching.

     Gaza residents said the Israelis had dropped leaflets warning people
     not to return to northern Gaza Strip as a temporary ceasefire
     between Israeli and Hamas began https://t.co/4yk9LThC3u

   As we posted earlier, Israeli troops fatally shot two Palestinians and
   wounded 11 others on Friday as they headed toward northern Gaza,
   Associated Press reported.

   The shooting took place as hundreds of Palestinians who sought refuge
   in southern Gaza were seen trying to head back to the north, despite
   warnings by the Israeli army not to attempt to return to their homes.

   Witnesses said Israeli troops were opening fire on people trying to
   head north.

   An AP journalist saw the two bodies and the wounded as they arrived at
   a hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah in the southern half of Gaza.
   The injured people had been shot in the legs.

   For the families of the Israelis hostages freed by Hamas, there was
   happiness mingled with concern for those who remained in Gaza, Reuters
   reports.

   “I am happy I received my family back, it’s allowed to feel joy and
   it’s allowed to shed a tear. That’s a human thing,” said Yoni Katz
   Asher, whose wife Doron and children Raz and Aviv were freed on Friday.

     But I am not celebrating, I will not celebrate until the last of the
     hostages returns home.

   Israeli leaders have sworn to free the rest of the hostages as the
   military pursues its invasion of Gaza in the wake of Hamas’ attack on 7
   October.

   For the moment, the hostages are being kept away from the media while
   their condition is assessed. And for those whose relatives have not
   come home, the wait continues in a conflicting swirl of feelings.

   “The emotions are mixed emotions,” said Shelly Shem Tov, the mother
   Omer Shem Tov, 21, who had attended the outdoor Supernova dance
   festival that was targeted in the attack and was among those taken
   hostage. He was not among those released on Friday.

   “I’m excited for the families who today are going to hug their loved
   ones,” she said in an interview with Israel’s Channel 12.

     I am jealous. And I am sad. Mostly sad that Omer is still not coming
     home.

   Hamas released the first group of hostages – 13 Israelis, 10 Thais and
   a Philippine national – on Friday, while Israel released 39 Palestinian
   prisoners.

   Organisers of a march against antisemitism billed as Britain’s biggest
   since the second world war have demanded that the far-right leader
   Stephen Yaxley-Lennon stay away.

   Yaxley-Lennon, who uses the name Tommy Robinson, has claimed to support
   the aims of the march through central London due to be held this
   Sunday.

   Organisers say it will be the biggest protest against anti-Jewish
   hatred since the 1936 Cable Street protests against Oswald Mosley’s
   blackshirts.

   Britain’s Jewish communities have suffered a large rise in antisemitism
   since the Middle East exploded into crisis after the Hamas attacks
   against Israel on 7 October. Police said up to 50,000 people were
   expected at Sunday’s march.

   A spokesperson for Campaign Against Antisemitism said:

     Contrary to what Tommy Robinson appears to believe, the drunken
     far-right thugs who came to ‘protect the Cenotaph’ on Armistice Day,
     some of whom shouted ‘sieg heil’ or hospitalised police officers,
     are not allies of the Jewish community and are not welcome at our
     solidarity march on Sunday 26 November.

     We look forward to seeing those who genuinely support our community
     and invite all of our allies to join us and march shoulder to
     shoulder in solidarity with British Jews.

   On 11 November, Armistice Day, Robinson supporters were among those who
   attacked police after claiming to be protecting war monuments from
   pro-Palestine marchers.

   The Met deputy assistant commissioner Ade Adelekan said:

     Having spoken to the Campaign Against Antisemitism, Tommy Robinson
     is not welcome at the march on Sunday.

   Police said they were aware that Robinson might try to attend posing as
   a reporter.

WHO 'extremely concerned' about safety of patients at al-Shifa after hospital
director arrested

   The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is “extremely
   concerned” about the safety of the estimated 100 patients and health
   worker remaining at Gaza’s al-Shifa hospital.

   In a statement published today, the WHO said it did not “have
   information about the well-being” of four health workers who have been
   arrested, including the director of al-Shifa hospital.

   On Thursday, Mohammad abu Salmiya and other medics were reportedly
   arrested by members of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) as they were
   travelling with a WHO evacuation convoy.

   The WHO said it participated in a “high-risk mission” on Wednesday, in
   cooperation with the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), to transfer
   151 patients, relatives and health workers from al-Shifa.

   During the screening process by members of the IDF, three medical
   personnel from the PRCS and three from the health ministry were
   detained, it said. The statement continued:

     Two of the six detained health workers have reportedly been
     released. We do not have information about the well-being of the
     four remaining health staff, including the director of Al-Shifa
     hospital. WHO calls for their legal and human rights to be fully
     observed during their detention.

   The IDF has confirmed Abu Salmiya had been arrested and transferred to
   the Shin Bet domestic security service for further questioning. It said
   that al-Shifa “under his direct management, served as a Hamas command
   and control centre” and that Hamas fighters had sought refuge in the
   hospital.

     And we expect that dozens more, including Americans, will be

'Real' chance of ceasefire extension, says Biden; putting conditions on
Israel aid 'worthwhile thought'

   Joe Biden has said the chances were “real” that a temporary ceasefire
   between Israel and Hamas could be extended.

   The pause in hostilities, which began this morning and will initially
   last four or five days, was announced early on Wednesday and has raised
   hopes for a more durable pause in the violence.

   The US president, speaking to reporters from Nantucket, Massachusetts
   earlier today, was asked whether the truce could be extended, Reuters
   reported. He replied:

     I think the chances are real.

   Asked what his expectations were, Biden said “I don’t know how long it
   will take,” adding:

     My expectation and hope is that as we move forward, the rest of the
     Arab world and the region is also putting pressure on all sides to
     slow this down, to bring this to an end as quickly as we can.

   He also said that conditioning military aid to Israel was a “worthwhile
   thought, but I don’t think if I started off with that we would have
   ever gotten where we are today”, AP reported.

   Spain and Belgium’s prime ministers called for a “permanent ceasefire”
   on Friday at the Rafah border crossing, welcoming a four-day truce that
   paused fighting between Israel and Hamas.

   “It is absolutely necessary to establish a lasting humanitarian
   ceasefire to reverse the catastrophic situation that the people of the
   [Gaza] Strip are going through,” said Spain’s prime minister, Pedro
   Sánchez.

   Alexander De Croo, Belgium’s prime minister, echoed Sánchez, saying:
   “The destruction of Gaza is unacceptable. We cannot accept that a
   society is being destroyed the way it is being destroyed.”
