   A recent intelligence report published by the UK’s Ministry of Defence
   about Russia’s attempt to capture the town of Avdiivka in the Donetsk
   region is the latest illustration of just how much the conflict in
   Ukraine is becoming a war of attrition. Russia’s push to mount a new
   offensive in the east has resulted in substantive “personnel losses”
   for its military.

   In the west, many assume that every inch of Ukrainian land that is
   liberated brings Russia closer to military defeat and Europe to peace.
   But Russia has adapted to both internal and external shocks. As of
   August, it was estimated that Russia had suffered “as many as 120,000
   deaths”. That number will have risen in recent weeks. And as the death
   toll climbs, the ability to replace troops becomes as important as
   military equipment and technology.

   Even though many young men left Russia rather than be sent to the
   front, the country still has a large pool of young men from which to
   recruit and has claimed to have enlisted a large number without
   resorting to general conscription – although the Kremlin’s figures have
   been questioned by other sources.

   But the question remains as to how many Russian military deaths is too
   many for Putin to retain the support of the Russian people. And it’s a
   very difficult question to answer. In Russia, the notion of military
   sacrifice plays an important role in informing national identity.

   Russia’s national story is constituted by loss. It has lived and
   continues to live a tale of self-induced suffering. Even just
   considering the past century, military losses during the second world
   war and in Afghanistan – followed by the loss of a sense of identity
   after the collapse of the Soviet empire in 1991 – have all come to
   define Russia’s character today. The sense of the “loss of empire” is
   what has driven Vladimir Putin’s foreign adventurism in Georgia and
   Ukraine.

For the motherland

   For the British people, the death of 179 solidiers in Iraq was
   traumatic enough for leaders to change course. But military sacrifice
   has a different meaning in Russia, one that is diametrically opposed to
   the value the liberal west places on the individual subject.

   For Russia, every dead soldier in Ukraine constitutes a step towards
   victory and reclaiming the great power image of the country’s Soviet
   past. While the west’s liberal philosophy promulgates the importance of
   individual rights, Russia is defined by a system of collectivism.
   Within its value system, the individual subject confers prestige
   through their self-sacrifice for the collective wellbeing.

   In Soviet iconography, tropes of self-sacrifice and fatal injury tend
   to be closely tied to nationalist ideas of pride and superiority. They
   pervaded propaganda posters during the “great patriotic war”.

   Kokorekin
   Russia’s notion of sacrifice: ‘For the Motherland’ (1942).

   Take the image For the Motherland! (1942) by Aleksei Kokorekin as an
   example. It conveyed Soviet resilience through the portrayal of a
   wounded soldier fighting on bravely and showing no sign of physical
   weakness despite his injuries.

   This juxtaposition between the injured self and national status is
   telling. Kokorekin’s depiction of Soviet heroism was also indicative of
   the Soviet mentality on death – where the emphasis on physical
   suffering became a source of national superiority.

Spirituality of loss

   This logic permeated the consciousness of subsequent generations and in
   how they interpreted military sacrifice. For her 1990 study Tsinkovye
   mal’chiki (translated as Zinky Boys) by Nobel prize-winning writer
   Svetlana Aleksievich, the author interviewed army veterans from the
   campaign in Afghanistan. She recalled how in one interview an artillery
   soldier described war as “a spiritual experience”, while referencing
   the self-sacrifice of the Red Army during the great patriotic war.

   This experience of spirituality through war not only reflects how
   Russians seek to replay and become part of the past, but speaks to the
   religious dimension of Russia’s discourse on self-sacrifice. This theme
   emerged strongly in comments by Patriarch Kirill, the head of the
   Russian Orthodox Church, in September 2022, in which he was encouraging
   Russian men to join up.

     …if a person dies in the performance of this duty [war], then they
     have undoubtedly committed an act equivalent to sacrifice. They will
     have sacrificed themselves for others. And therefore, we believe
     that this sacrifice washes away all the sins that a person has
     committed.

   His statement rationalised the self-sacrifice of the Russian soldier on
   the basis that it served a transcendental duty – a Christ-like
   sacrifice – which would ultimately absolve them from sin. The
   patriarch’s comments speak to a particular historical tradition of
   religious masochism – the practice of self-induced physical trauma – in
   Russia, which dates back to “the early days of Christian Rus’”.

Military martyrdom

   Deciphering this internal logic governing the way many Russians deal
   with loss is imperative to the west’s understanding of the Ukraine war.
   Putin draws on a language of sacrifice which has its cultural and
   historical roots in Russian Orthodox thinking and Soviet mythology.

   This language reveals something important about Russian psychology when
   it comes to dealing with news of large-scale casualties on the
   battlefield. A soldier’s body is a potent mixture of the political and
   spiritual in the Russian psyche.

   The death of that body is for Russia a step towards achieving the
   fantasy of national prestige. For some Russians (by no means all), the
   trauma of military loss does not mean that they should stop fighting in
   Ukraine. On the contrary, it can represent a pathway to martyrdom.
