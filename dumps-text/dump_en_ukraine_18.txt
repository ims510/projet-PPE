   A man from the Siberian region of Buryatia was sentenced to five years in
   prison after it turned out that he attempted to avoid returning to the war
   in Ukraine by acquiring a false death certificate, RFE/RL has learned.
   Zorigto Arabzhayev was mobilized and sent to Ukraine in November 2022 and
   returned on leave in the spring. When military officials came to his home
   after he failed to return to his unit, his son told them he had died and
   showed them a death certificate that turned out to be fake upon further
   investigation. Arabzhayev was subsequently arrested. To read the original

   A Russian strike on a train station in the southern Ukrainian city of
   Kherson has killed at least one person and wounded four others, the
   Ukrainian interior minister said on December 26.

   Ihor Klymenko said that the attack killed at least one person and wounded
   four others. The train station was filled with about 140 civilians waiting
   for an evacuation train at the time of the attack.

   Ukraine’s national railway operator said the station and trains were
   damaged in the attack.

   "Currently, several injured workers are known. Passengers are in shelter,"
   Ukrzaliznytsia added.

  Opposition In Serbia Holds Ninth Day Of Protest Over Alleged Election Fraud

   25.

   Several hundred people gathered on December 26 in Belgrade for another
   protest organized by the opposition to demand the cancellation of
   elections held earlier this month.

   It was the ninth day of protests by the Serbia Against Violence coalition
   since parliamentary and local elections on December 17 in which the ruling
   Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) of President Aleksandar Vucic declared
   victory at all levels.

   The Serbia Against Violence coalition accuses the SNS of election fraud,
   which the party and the state leadership deny.

   "We will not recognize the theft, and the electoral will of the citizens
   will be defended," Vladimir Obradovic, the Serbia Against Violence
   coalition’s candidate for mayor of Belgrade, said during the protest on
   December 26.

   As Obradovic spoke the protest continued in front of the Palace of
   Justice, where the Belgrade courts and the Prosecutor-General’s Office are
   located. The protesters demanded the release of all people arrested after
   a protest on December 24, saying they were being held unjustly.

   Almost 40 demonstrators were arrested after incidents following that
   protest, which was the first to turn violent. Police officers inside the
   assembly building prevented some people from entering, using tear gas and
   pepper spray after windows of the building were broken. The police said
   eight officers were injured.

   The Serbia Against Violence coalition said the incidents were carried out
   by "hooligans sent by the government."

   Separately, Marinika Tepic, a leading figure in Serbia's main opposition
   party, vowed to press on with a hunger strike to protest election fraud.

   Tepic, who went on hunger strike along with five colleagues following the
   vote, was placed on intravenous drips following a deterioration in her
   health on December 25. She told Reuters in an interview that she planned
   to reject further medical advice to end her protest.

   "They will probably ask me to stop the hunger strike and I will ask them
   to help this struggle to continue," Tepic said. "This is the struggle for
   our freedom."

   Tepic echoed the claims of the opposition accusing authorities of
   including dead people on voter lists and bringing in ethnic Serbs from
   Bosnia-Herzegovina and other former Yugoslav republics to vote in
   Belgrade, thus handing victory to the SNS.

   The electoral commission announced on December 24 that it determined
   following a check of voter lists that the claims were “not true.”

   Vucic has denied allegations by domestic nongovernmental organizations,
   foreign observers, and opposition figures of electoral irregularities. He
   said the vote took place in a democratic atmosphere and was "the most
   peaceful ever in modern history."

   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and other
   international observers denounced what they called a series of
   "irregularities" in the voting. Domestic nongovernmental
   election-monitoring groups also alleged irregularities following the vote.

   The U.S. State Department has called on the authorities in Serbia to
   cooperate with the OSCE mission in investigating allegations of electoral
   irregularities.

  EU Welcomes Serbia's Decision To Recognize Vehicle License Plates Issued By
                                     Kosovo

   Vehicles traveling from Kosovo wait in line at a Kosovo-Serbia border
   crossing in Merdare earlier this month.

   The European Union has welcomed Serbia's decision to recognize vehicle
   license plates issued by Kosovo, saying it demonstrates that progress in
   the process of normalizing relations is possible.

   EU foreign affairs spokesperson Peter Stano said on X, formerly Twitter,
   on December 26 that the decision was “a positive step in the
   implementation of the Agreement on the Path to Normalisation, as well as
   past Dialogue commitments related to Freedom of Movement.”

   He also said it was "a step in the right direction towards better regional
   and EU integration of the W. Balkans, which ultimately benefits the
   citizens of the region."

   The European Union expects Kosovo to respond in a similar manner, he
   added.

   There has been no response from the Kosovo government on whether it will
   reciprocate.

   Vehicle license plates became a flashpoint over their display of national
   symbols. Until now, vehicles from either Kosovo or Serbia could cross the
   border only if they placed stickers to hide the symbols.

   Serbia decided on December 25 to allow all vehicles from Kosovo with
   Republic of Kosovo license plates to cross freely. Petar Petkovic, the
   head of the Serbian government office for Kosovo, confirmed that the
   decision will apply from January 1, 2024.

   Petkovic said that a disclaimer will be posted at all border and
   administrative crossings stating that the change was made for practical
   reasons to facilitate freedom of movement “and that it cannot be
   interpreted as recognition of Kosovo's independence.”

   Serbia in 2011 agreed to recognize Kosovo license plates and vice versa
   after a European Union (EU) mediated deal, but the decision was never
   fully implemented.

   Kosovo earlier this year pulled back from a controversial decision to
   penalize drivers who did not swap vehicle license plates issued by Serbia
   for those issued by Pristina.

   Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry has ordered the expulsion of two French
   diplomats due to "activities incompatible with their diplomatic status."
   The ministry said in a December 26 statement that it had summoned the
   French ambassador to express a "strong protest over the actions of two
   employees of the French Embassy." The two were ordered to leave within 48
   hours. There was no immediate reaction from Paris to the move, and it
   wasn't immediately clear what prompted it, Tensions between the two
   countries have climbed in recent years, as France has stepped up support
   for neighboring Armenia, and escalated its criticism of Baku. To read the

        Kremlin Critic Aleksei Navalny Confirms Arrival At Arctic Prison

   Kremlin critic Aleksei Navalny has published his first message from the
   Arctic prison he has been transferred to, telling his followers on X,
   formerly Twitter, not to worry about him after an absence of more than two
   weeks that raised concerns about his well-being.

   “I'm totally relieved that I've finally made it,” Navalny said in a series
   of posts on December 26 from the prison in the village of Kharp in the
   Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District. “Thanks again to everyone for your
   support. And happy holidays!”

   Navalny joked that he is “still in a good mood, as befits a Santa Claus.”
   He said he now has a sheepskin coat and a fur hat with flaps to cover his
   ears and expects to receive winter footwear. He also said he grew a beard
   during his transfer, which he said lasted 20 days and was “quite tiring.”

   “They brought me on Saturday evening (December 23). And they transported
   me with such precautions and on such a strange route…that I did not expect
   anyone to find me here before mid-January,” he said.

   He also said he was “very surprised” on December 25 when his lawyer
   arrived to see him. He also described some of the conditions in the
   prison, saying he “went for a walk” to a neighboring cell that was a “bit
   bigger with snow on the ground.” He added that from his cell window he can
   only see a fence that is very close.

   Navalny was transported to the Arctic prison from a prison in the Vladimir
   region about 240 kilometers east of Moscow. The Kremlin critic was
   sentenced to 19 years in prison in August on extremism charges, on top of
   previous sentences for fraud. He says the charges are politically
   motivated, and human rights organizations have recognized him as a
   political prisoner.

   Navalny’s associates reported on December 25 that he was in penal colony
   No. 3 in Kharp and that his lawyer had visited him.

   The so-called Polar Wolf colony is one of the most remote, said Ivan
   Zhdanov on X, formerly Twitter, on December 25.

   “The conditions there are harsh, with a special regime in the permafrost
   zone. It is very difficult to get there, and there are no letter delivery
   systems,” said Zhdanov.

   Kira Yarmysh, spokeswoman for Navalny said on CNN that Navalny and his
   team, including many who have fled the country amid pressure from Russian
   authorities, will continue their work because they believe it’s something
   Russia needs.

   “Russia is repressed by a dictator,” she said. Navalny “knows he needs to
   keep going.”

   Navalny has posed one of the most serious threats to Russian President
   Vladimir Putin, who recently announced he is running for reelection in
   March.

   Putin is expected to comfortably win the election amid the continued
   sidelining of opponents and a clampdown on opposition and civil society
   that intensified after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

   Navalny survived a poisoning with a Novichok-type nerve agent in 2020 that
   he says was ordered by Putin. The Kremlin has denied any role in Navalny's
   poisoning.

    Ukrainian Air Force Claims Destruction Of Russian Ship In Crimea; Moscow
                            Confirms Missile Strike

   FEODOSIA, Ukraine -- Ukraine's air force hit a major naval port on the
   Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula, and claimed a Russian naval landing
   ship docked there was destroyed.

   Ukraine’s military said in a post to Telegram on December 26 that tactical
   aviation units fired cruise missiles at the port of Feodosia, on the
   eastern side of the Black Sea peninsula, around 3 a.m. local time, hitting
   the ship, the Novocherkassk.

   Explosions reverberated throughout the city, waking up residents, setting
   off car alarms, and breaking storefront and building windows some distance
   away from the port.

   The commander of Ukraine’s air force, Lieutenant General Mykola Oleshchuk,
   said in a post on Telegram that “Russia’s naval fleet is getting smaller,”
   and suggested that Ukrainian jets were involved, but gave no other
   details.

   “We saw how powerful the explosion and detonation were," Colonel Yuriy
   Ihnat, an air force spokesman, told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service. "It’s
   extremely difficult for a ship to survive something like that."

   attack.

   “An enemy attack was carried out in the Feodosia area. The port area is
   cordoned off. At this moment, explosions have stopped and the fire has
   been contained,” Sergei Aksyonov, the Russian-backed governor of the
   Crimea region, said in a post to Telegram.

   Unverified photos and videos showed fireballs climbing into the night sky,
   accompanied by an enormous shockwave. Photographs taken by a correspondent
   for Crimea Realities, a regional desk of RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service,
   showed broken windows on several buildings along the city’s waterfront
   embankment.

   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy expressed "special thanks" to the
   Ukrainian Air Force for its "excellent work against the occupiers in
   Crimea" but did not say anything specific about the attack or the state of
   the Novocherkassk.

   RFE/RL's Crimea.Realities reported that two Russian vessels left the port
   of Feodosia in the afternoon of December 26. It was not possible to
   identify the ships by name, but judging by their size, the vessels were a

     * Elsewhere, Russia’s military claimed the capture of the eastern town
   of Maryinka, which would potentially open up a new corridor for advancing
   in the Donetsk region. Shoigu was shown in a televised meeting on December
   25 telling Putin about the town’s purported capture.

   Kyiv initially disputed the claim, but on December 26 the Ukrainian
   military's commander in chief, General Valeriy Zaluzhniy, said Kyiv's
   forces had retreated from Maryinka and new defense lines had been prepared
   outside the town, which is largely destroyed and deserted but holds
   strategic importance.

   Maryinka is located just under 30 kilometers southwest of the city of
   Donetsk, which is controlled by Russian forces.

   Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said late on December 26 that a
   Russian strike on a train station in the southern city of Kherson killed

   to put economic cooperation ahead of any “political ambitions” of members
   when he assumes the rotating chairmanship of the Russia-led Eurasian
   Economic Union (EAES) in 2024. Armenia’s normally tight relations with
   Moscow have frayed in recent years after a series of disagreements,
   including Yerevan’s criticism of Russia for what it saw as a lack of
   support as rival Azerbaijan retook the ethnic-Armenian populated breakaway
   region of Nagorno-Karabakh this year. Pashinian was speaking in St.
   Petersburg, where he attended a council meeting of the EAES, which also
   includes Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Kyrgyzstan. To read the original story

   fundamental change of circumstances...the involvement of the Republic of
   Belarus in the illegal use of force against Ukraine," he said. The
   government proposes terminating the free trade agreement of December 1992
   and two protocols related to the treaty. After Russia's invasion, Ukraine
   suspended its trade relations with Minsk.

   Israeli Air Strike In Syria Kills Commander Of Iran's Revolutionary Guard

   Razi Mousavi was a senior adviser in Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps.

   An Israeli air strike in Syria killed a top commander of Iran’s Islamic
   Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), prompting Tehran to threaten that
   Israeli will “certainly pay” for its actions.

   Iranian state media on December 25 identified the commander as Razi
   Mousavi, a senior adviser of the IRGC Quds Force, saying he had been
   killed in an air strike near the Syrian capital, Damascus.

   Full details of the attack were not disclosed, although Iran’s official
   IRNA news agency reported it took place in the Zeinabiyah district in the
   Damascus suburbs.

   Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said in a statement that Israel "will
   certainly pay for this crime."

   Reuters quoted three sources as saying that Mousavi was responsible for
   military coordination between Tehran and Damascus as part of the IRGC's
   Quds Force.

   The Tasnim news agency, which is close to the IRGC, said Mousavi was one
   of the oldest advisers of the force in Syria and "an associate" of Qasem
   Soleimani, a former Quds commander who was killed in January 2020 in an
   air strike by U.S. forces near Baghdad. The United States held Soleimani
   responsible for the deaths of many of its soldiers in Iraq.

   The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Israel targeted Mousavi at a
   farm in the area that reportedly housed several offices for the
   Lebanon-based Hizballah extremist group. Israeli forces have been
   exchanging intensified gunfire with Hizballah fighters along the Lebanese
   border in recent months.

   Israel did not immediately comment on the attack, but it has consistently
   vowed that Iran will not be allowed to establish a presence in Syria.
   President Bashar al-Assad of Syria is a close ally of Iran and Russia,
   relying on their support to remain in power despite major opposition and a
   civil war in the country.

   In early December, Israel said its air strikes had killed two IRGC members
   in Syria who had served as military advisers there, also prompting vows of
   revenge by Tehran.

   A U.S. State Department report this month said Iran remained the leading
   state sponsor of global terrorism last year, involved in backing terrorist
   recruitment, financing, and plotting across Africa, Asia, Europe, and the
   Americas.

   The report said Tehran also provided support to extremist groups in
   Bahrain, Iraq, and Syria through its Quds Force with the aim of creating
   instability in the region.

   Foreign shareholders suspended participation in the Arctic LNG 2 project
   due to sanctions, renouncing their responsibilities for financing and for
   offtake contracts for the new Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant,
   the daily Kommersant reported on December 25. The project, seen as a key
   element in Russia's drive to boost its LNG global market share to 20
   percent by 2030 from 8 percent, was already facing difficulties due to
   U.S. sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine and a lack of gas carriers.
   The newspaper said the suspension may lead to Arctic LNG 2 losing its
   long-term contracts on LNG supplies.

 'Highest Possible Level Of Isolation': Kremlin Critic Navalny Moved To Arctic
                                  Penal Colony

   Jailed Russian opposition activist Aleksei Navalny gestures during a court
   hearing in Moscow in February 2021.

   Imprisoned Russian opposition politician Aleksei Navalny, whose
   whereabouts had been unknown since early December, has been moved to a
   penal colony in the brutally cold Arctic region, his spokeswoman said
   December 25.

   "We have found Aleksei Navalny. He is now in [penal colony]-3 in the
   settlement of Kharp in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District. His lawyer
   visited him today. Aleksei is doing well," Kira Yarmysh announced on
   social media platform X.

   The remote region, which spans the Arctic Circle, is known for its brutal
   winters and includes the former Soviet prison-camp city of Vorkuta, which
   is Europe’s easternmost and coldest town, about 100 kilometers from the
   Kharp site.

   “It is almost impossible to get to this colony; it is almost impossible to
   even send letters there,” Leonid Volkov, Navalny’s chief strategist, wrote
   on social media.

   "This is the highest possible level of isolation from the world, which is
   what it was all about," he added.

   It was Navalny’s longest absence since he was taken into captivity in
   January 2021 after returning to Russia from Germany, where he underwent
   treatment for a near-fatal nerve-agent poisoning that he believes was
   carried out by Russian security operatives at the behest of authoritarian
   President Vladimir Putin.

   Navalny’s supporters have launched an Internet campaign using the hashtag
   #WhereIsNavalny.

   The United States on December 25 said it welcomed that the 47-year-old
   Kremlin critic had been located but added it remained "deeply concerned"
   about his safety and detention conditions.

   A spokesperson said Washington joined the activist's family and supporters
   "in calling for his immediate release, without conditions."

   "We call on the Russian government to end its escalating repression of
   independent voices in Russia," the spokesperson added.

   Council of Europe Secretary General Marija Pejcinovic Buric wrote on X
   that she had “serious concerns” about Navalny and called for his release
   “in line with relevant judgements of the European Court of Human Rights.”

   Prison officials had said Navalny was no longer in the Vladimir region
   prison where he had been serving a 19-year term but had refused to say
   where he is. In a statement on December 12, the Federal Penitentiary
   Service (FSIN) said only that Navalny had left “for a penal institution
   outside the borders of Vladimir Oblast.”

   The process of transferring convicts in Russia, known as "etap," involves
   "vagonzaks" -- trains specifically designed for prisoners.

   Such trains have caged compartments for prisoners, who are provided with
   little fresh air, no showers, and only limited access to food or a toilet.

   The transfers can take days, weeks, or even months as the trains stop and
   convicts spend time in transit prisons. Convicts almost always face
   humiliation, beatings, and sometimes even death at the hands of their
   guards or other convicts.

   Harsh rules dating back to Soviet times provide for the prisoners'
   families and lawyers being informed about their whereabouts only after
   they have reached their destination.

   Earlier this month, two courts in the Vladimir region have postponed
   hearings into complaints filed by Navalny pending information on his
   whereabouts.

   Navalny had complained of a concerted campaign of harassment and
   mistreatment since his imprisonment, including sleep deprivation, repeated
   stints in punishment cells for minor alleged infractions, and a lack of
   medical care.

   He has been recognized as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty
   International and listed as a political prisoner by Russia’s banned
   Memorial human-rights group.

   Latvia has given Ukraine more than 270 vehicles confiscated from drunk
   drivers this year. The vehicles have a total value of nearly $1.1 million,
   the Latvian news portal Delfi reported on December 25. In February, the
   Latvian parliament decided that confiscated vehicles should be handed over
   to Ukraine for free. As a result of Russian air strikes and fighting in
   Ukraine since Moscow's invasion in early 2022, civilian cars are regularly
   damaged or destroyed. Ukrainian citizens are in urgent need of vehicles in
   order to flee from areas particularly affected by the war.

   Iran's Foreign Ministry has rejected on Washington's claims that a drone

   The December 23 targeting of the Japanese-owned Chem Pluto chemical tanker
   came amid a flurry of drone and missile attacks by Yemen's Iran-backed
   Huthi rebels in the Red Sea in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, where
   Israel is battling militants from Hamas, a group designated as a terrorist
   organization by Washington and the EU. The Pentagon later openly accused
   Tehran of the attack. "We declare these claims as completely rejected and
   worthless," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said on

   traveled 1,600 kilometers on December 21 from Turbat, a town in
   Balochistan Province, to protest forced disappearances and extrajudicial
   killings in the militancy-ravaged southwest. The protesters were mostly
   women and some had brought along their children, aged 7-12, when security
   forces used batons and water canons to disperse and arrest them.

   BELGRADE -- Student groups ended their seven-hour blockade of central
   Belgrade streets without major incidents after they had joined angry
   opposition supporters on December 25 in protests against alleged fraud in
   elections last weekend.

   Student leaders demanded that the authorities grant access to voter lists
   to verify the eligibility of participants in the December 17 elections
   after domestic and European organizations observers expressed doubts about
   the validity of many ballots.

   Many of the Belgrade students -- joined by students from Novi Sad
   University -- left the blockade after about seven hours and joined the
   main protests.

   Student leaders said they did not expect their street blockades to be
   repeated on December 26, but opposition leaders said they planned to
   returm to the streets for a ninth night of protests.

   Many of the protesters concluded their actions in front of the Belgrade
   city police department headquarters. Local media reported that some
   students had been arrested, but information remained scarce.

   Miroslav Aleksic, a leader of the opposition coalition, thanked students
   for aiding their efforts.

   The opposition groups, led by the pro-Europe Serbia Against Violence
   coalition, claimed that populist President Aleksandar Vucic’s ruling
   Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) had brought in ethnic Serbs from
   Bosnia-Herzegovina and other former Yugoslav republics to vote in Belgrade
   in the parliamentary and local elections, thus handing victory to the SNS.

   Western observers, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation
   in Europe, also assailed the ruling party's grip on media sources and
   intimidation tactics throughout the campaign leading up to election day.

   Vucic and his government have denied allegations of voter irregularities
   and have said the elections were held under democratic conditions.

   In a social media post on December 25, the U.S. ambassador to Belgrade,
   Christopher Hill, wrote: “In the hours and days ahead, Serbia's leaders
   and its citizens should remember: The legitimacy of democratic processes
   depends upon transparency and on the readiness of all parties, winning or
   losing, to respect the will of the people as expressed at the ballot box.”

   Overnight, dozens of people were detained and at least seven police
   officers injured in Belgrade as riot police tried to prevent hundreds of
   the opposition supporters from entering the city council building.

   Some people battled with police outside the city hall, smashing windows,
   breaking doors, and attempting to force their way in.

   Opposition leaders later alleged that violence at the demonstrations had
   been perpetrated by “hooligans sent by the authorities.” It was not
   possible to immediately verify the claims.

   Vucic called the protest an attempt to overthrow the government instigated
   from abroad. The president said more than 35 people were arrested and more
   detentions would follow.

   “This was an attempted violent takeover of state institutions,” Vucic told
   the pro-government Pink TV late on December 24, adding that there was
   evidence that "everything was prepared in advance.”

   Vucic called the demonstrators “thugs” who would not succeed in
   destabilizing the country. He suggested that the unrest was orchestrated
   from abroad but provided no evidence to support the claim.

   The protest was called by the Serbia Against Violence coalition, which
   rejected the outcome of the December 17 elections following victory claims
   by the SNS.

   International and domestic election observers reported multiple
   irregularities, including cases of bought votes and the stuffing of ballot
   boxes.

   There have been peaceful protests every evening since the vote, with the
   opposition demanding the annulment of election results. The December 24
   protest was the first to turn violent.

   "The whole world has seen the theft that has not been recorded. In
   Belgrade, we won. Belgrade is a free city," opposition politician Srdjan
   Milivojevic of the Democratic Party said at the rally.

   Protesters carried banners and flags of Serbia and the European Union as
   they blew whistles and repeatedly shouted "thieves, thieves" during the
   demonstrations.

   Vucic said the newly elected parliament -- with the SNS in control --
   would be installed in January 2024 and that formation of the government is
   expected at the end of February.

   On December 23, the Serbian Prosecutor's Office said it had launched an
   investigation into the allegations.

   On election night, the Belgrade Electoral Commission reported that the SNS
   won 39.3 percent of the votes in the Belgrade elections, and the Serbia
   Against Violence won 34.3 percent.

   In the nationwide parliamentary vote, officials said that -- based on
   complete but uncertified results -- the SNS received about 46 percent of
   the vote and Serbia Against Violence won 23.5 percent.

   Officials said final results on both parliamentary and local elections in
   Belgrade are still pending and could take months to determine.

   Girkin, 52, has been charged with public calls for extremist activities.
   He pleaded not guilty in a trial that began on December 14. He was
   arrested in July after he sharply criticized President Vladimir Putin for
   his “too kind’ handling of the Ukraine invasion, referring to him as a
   “nonentity” and accusing him of “cowardly mediocrity.” He has urged for a
   more-aggressive war against Ukraine and total mobilization for Russia to

   KYIV --Russia on December 25 said its forces had captured the strategic
   Donetsk region town of Maryinka in eastern Ukraine, but Kyiv disputed the
   claim, reporting that its troops had repelled three “unsuccessful attacks”
   near the ruined and nearly deserted community.

  Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine

   RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on
   Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military
   aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's
   coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.

   "It's not correct to talk about seizing Maryinka," Ukrainian military
   spokesman Oleksandr Shtupun told Ukrainian TV following claims made by
   Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu during a televised meeting with
   President Vladimir Putin.

   "The fighting for Maryinka continues,” Shtupun said.

   “Currently, our servicemen are within the administrative borders of
   Maryinka, but the city has been completely destroyed,” he added.

   Maryinka is a relatively small town -- with a prewar population under
   10,000 -- but, according to British intelligence, the Russian military has
   been seeking to capture it in order to advance further west and better
   protect occupied Donetsk city.

   The fighting comes as Ukraine celebrated Christmas on December 25 for the
   first time instead of the traditional January date of past years.

   President Volodymyr Zelenskiy signed a law in July moving the official
   holiday to December 25 from January 7, the day observed by the Russian
   Orthodox Church. The law stated its goal was to “abandon the Russian
   heritage” following Moscow's decision to invade in February 2022.

   The switch brings Ukraine's Orthodox worshippers in line with the
   country's Catholics, who earlier this year approved a similar change in
   calendars.

     * Ukraine’s military on Christmas Day said its forces shot down dozens
   of Iranian-made Shahed drones and claimed to have blasted another two
   Russian fighter jets from the sky, adding to previous claims of mounting
   success against enemy air assaults.

   Ukrainian military authorities said the jets had been downed late on
   December 24, following reports that the country’s forces had shot down
   three jets in the previous two days, as Kyiv and Moscow exchanged
   unconfirmed claims that enemy warplanes had been downed. It also said 38
   Shahed drones had been shot down.

   One of the Russian jets was downed in the area of occupied Mariupol, a
   Ukrainian official said.

   "It has been confirmed that our anti-aircraft missile system hit an Su-34
   fighter-bomber in the Mariupol sector. It did not return to its airfield,"
   Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk said on Telegram,

   Reports from either side could not immediately be independently verified.

   But they come as Kyiv awaits delivery in the coming days of the
   long-desired first shipment of advanced F-16 fighter jets as Ukraine
   attempts to counter Russia’s air supremacy over occupied territory.

   Meanwhile, Ukrainian military spokesman Shtupun in Ukraine’s Tavria region
   said Russian occupying forces are "increasingly" refusing to take part in
   assault operations at the front lines.

   “There is information about an increasing number of occupiers' refusals to
   participate in assault operations. In particular, this was seen in the
   units of [Russia’s] 1st Army Corps," he said.

   Elsewhere on the battlefield, the Ukrainian military reported the movement
   of Russian tanks in the Mariupol district.

   "Over the weekend, the movement of tanks -- at least five units -- with
   modern modifications was detected through Mariupol in the direction of
   Berdyansk," said Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s Mariupol
   mayor.

   Mariupol was occupied by Russian troops in the spring of 2022 after a long
   siege and street fighting. The city was badly damaged. Currently, it is
   located at a considerable distance from the front line, but Ukrainian
   forces periodically launch missile strikes on Russian military facilities
   in Mariupol.

   Ukraine also announced good news on Christmas Day on the economic front,
   saying it had received $1.34 billion in financing, mostly through the
   World Bank -- funds that will be partially used to compensate social
   programs for monies lost to security and defense financial needs.

   The Finance Ministry said the package consisted of a $1.086 billion loan
   from the World Bank, a $190 million grant from Norway, $50 million from
   the United States, and $20 million from Switzerland.

   "International financial assistance is a significant contribution to
   maintaining the financial and economic stability of Ukraine and allows us
   to ensure priority social expenditures during the war," Finance Minister
   Serhiy Marchenko said.

   "Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the governments of Japan,
   the United States, Norway, and Switzerland have repeatedly demonstrated
   their unwavering support and solidarity to Ukraine," he added.

   Thousands Gather In Belgrade To Protest Serbian Election, Demand Annulment

   allegations of election theft on December 24.

   BELGRADE -- Several thousand people gathered for a seventh night in
   central Belgrade to protest what the opposition and many Western observers
   called fraud in the country’s December 17 parliamentary and local
   elections, with some demonstrators attempting to enter the capital’s
   assembly building late in the evening.

   The December 24 protest was called by the pro-Europe Serbia Against
   Violence coalition, which rejected the outcome of the elections following
   victory claims by President Aleksandar Vucic's ruling Serbian Progressive
   Party (SNS).

   "The whole world has seen the theft that has not been recorded. In
   Belgrade, we won. Belgrade is a free city," opposition politician Srdjan
   Milivojevic of the Democratic Party said at the rally.

   Police officers were reportedly inside the assembly building, poised to
   fend off protesters attempting to gain entry into the site, where windows
   had been broken. Police fired tear gas at demonstrators.

   Protesters carried banners and flags of Serbia and the European Union as
   they blew whistles and repeatedly shouted "Thieves, thieves!" during the
   protests.

   Earlier, opposition figures from the Serbia Against Violence list said
   they wanted to enter the assembly building to address people from the
   balcony at the site.

   The protest had begun in front of the headquarters of the Republic
   Electoral Commission (RIK), where thousands of citizens answered calls to
   appear by the opposition coalition.

   The opposition is demanding annulment of election results at all levels
   because of what it says was widespread fraud, claiming that Vucic's SNS
   stole the elections.

   Vucic denied allegations by domestic nongovernmental organizations,
   foreign observers, and opposition figures of electoral irregularities. He
   said the vote took place in a democratic atmosphere and were "the most
   peaceful ever in modern history."

   He said it was solely up to the country's institutions to decide whether
   any elections should be rerun.

   Vucic said the newly elected parliament -- with the SNS in control --
   would be installed in January 2024 and that formation of the government is
   expected at the end of February.

   He added, without elaborating, that he did not expect Ana Brnabic to
   remain as prime minister in the next government. But he said she will
   perform "significant functions in the future."

   On December 23, the Serbian Prosecutor's Office said it had launched an
   investigation into allegations of fraud during the elections after it said
   it received reports of possible irregularities, including vote buying and
   the falsifying of ballots and signatures

   The OSCE and other international observers denounced what they called a
   series of "irregularities" in the voting. Domestic nongovernmental
   election-monitoring groups also alleged irregularities following the vote.

   Among the claims by the opposition were allegations that the ruling party
   brought in ethnic Serbs from Bosnia-Herzegovina and other former Yugoslav
   republics to vote in the capital.

   Election officials at the RIK on December 24 said that, following a check
   of voter lists, they had determined that the claims of ineligible voters
   taking part in the Belgrade elections were "not true."

   On election night, the Belgrade Electoral Commission reported that the SNS
   list won 39.3 percent of the votes (49 mandates) in the Belgrade
   elections, and the Serbia Against Violence list won 34.3 percent (42
   mandates).

   In the nationwide parliamentary vote, officials said that, based on
   complete but uncertified results, the SNS received about 46 percent of the
   vote and Serbia Against Violence won 23.5 percent.

   Officials said final results on both parliamentary and local elections in
   Belgrade are still pending and could take months to determine, given that
   some objections filed could lead to the repeating of elections at
   particular precincts.

   Polish truckers on December 24 ended their blockade of a border checkpoint
   with Ukraine, Kyiv said, days after the countries discussed resolving a
   row that has soured ties. Polish haulers have blocked crossing points
   since early November to protest what they say is unfair competition from
   Ukrainian truckers. The Ukrainian border guard on December 24 said the
   protest at the Medyka-Shehyni checkpoint ended at 9:30 a.m., with the
   registration and crossing of trucks resuming "as usual." The European
   Union had waived a requirement for Ukrainian transport companies to
   possess entry permits in a gesture of solidarity after Russia's invasion
   in February 2022.

       Moldova Pro-West President Sandu To Seek Reelection, EU Referendum

   Moldovan President Maia Sandu attends a rally celebrating the European
   Union's decision to open membership talks with Moldova, in Chisinau on
   December 17.

   CHISINAU – Maia Sandu, Moldova’s pro-Western president, announced she will
   seek reelection next year and also called on parliament to organize a
   referendum on her small southeastern European nation’s potential accession
   to the EU.

   “Our future lies in the European family and it is necessary to say clearly
   -- the whole country -- which path we choose for Moldova,” she said in a
   Facebook post and video on December 24.

   “I call on parliament to initiate the holding of a referendum next autumn,
   at which the voice of citizens will be decisive,” she added.

   At a summit in Brussels, the EU on December 14 announced the decision to
   open membership negotiations with Moldova and Ukraine and to grant
   candidacy status to Georgia.

   Sandu at the time invited citizens to a pro-European gathering on December
   17 in Chisinau to herald what she described as the "historic step for the
   destiny of our country."

   Moldova's pro-Western prime minister, Dorin Recean, echoed Sandu, saying
   that "Moldova is European" and "our future is in the EU."

   Sandu on December 14 also hailed parliament’s adoption of a national
   defense strategy tying her nation to the West, saying it "is a big step
   toward strengthening the security and stability of our country."

   Sandu added that the government's goal is to transform Moldova -- which
   has a population of about 3.5 million people -- from "a vulnerable state
   with fragile democracy" into a "strong, modern, resilient, and European
   state, capable of taking care of its citizens."

   In her Christmas Eve comments, Sandu asked asks voters to support her for
   another term as president in the elections expected to take place in
   November 2024.

   It was not immediately clear whether Sandu is seeking to hold a referendum
   on EU membership at the same time.

   It would be the third time Sandu has run for president. She was defeated
   by pro-Moscow Socialist Igor Dodon in 2016 but scored a victory against
   Dodon in 2020.

   In a Facebook posting, Dodon on December 24 blasted Sandu’s announcement,
   saying that “after three years in office, Maia Sandu has nothing to offer
   but a referendum to ‘save’ her from political drowning.”

   “She hopes to partner with Europe and that this will bring her a new
   mandate. But people are no longer as naive as they were in 2020. Today,
   they associate Maia Sandu not with progress and law, but with poverty,
   arrogance, and anti-democratic abuse,” he said, adding that the Socialists
   "have every moral and legal basis" to run the country.

   Afghanistan will launch a massive new polio vaccination campaign on
   December 25 aimed at protecting more than 8.8 million children, the Health
   Ministry announced on December 24. The campaign will last four days, but
   will be extended to one week in 42 districts in the eastern part of the
   country where the risk of the wild virus is very high, the ministry added.
   Children under the age of 10 will be vaccinated in these areas too, while
   elsewhere the age cap for the vaccine is 5. The number of positive cases
   recorded this year is concerning, the ministry said.
