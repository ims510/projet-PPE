   Here is the situation on Saturday, October 21, 2023.

Fighting

     * A man was killed and a woman was left in a critical condition after
       a Russian missile hit homes in Kryvyi Rih in the central Ukrainian
       region of Dnipropetrovsk.
     * Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the south of the
       country where he said his armed forces had repelled a new Russian
       offensive against the eastern town of Avdiivka and Ukrainian forces
       were holding their ground.
     * Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the headquarters of
       Russia’s Southern Military District, located less than 100km (60
       miles) from Ukraine’s southeastern border. Putin was briefed on the
       war by the Chief of the General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, the
       Kremlin said.

     * The Ukrainian military said fighting was raging along the front
       line, with about 90 combat clashes in the past 24 hours. That
       compares with an average of about 60 daily clashes a week ago.
     * Russian forces have intensified attacks around Avdiivka and
       Kupiansk. Kyiv said the military aim of the Russian attacks around
       Avdiivka and Kupiansk was to draw in Ukrainian troops from other
       front lines and to try to gain ground before winter sets in.
     * The Institute for the Study of War, a US-based think tank, said
       Ukrainian forces appeared to have broken through on the eastern
       bank of the Dnipro river in Kherson.
     * Kyiv has not commented and Russia’s defence ministry said it had
       thwarted attempts by Ukrainian troops to establish a foothold on
       the Russian-controlled bank of the Dnipro river.
     * Russia named a replacement for the former head of the country’s
       Aerospace Forces. State media reported that Colonel General Viktor
       Afzalov, acting head of the air force, had officially replaced
       General Sergei Surovikin  – who came under suspicion following the
       revolt by Wagner mercenaries against Moscow’s military leaders
       earlier this year.

Politics

     * Russia ordered Russian American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva to be
       detained for three additional days, after prosecutors said she had
       failed to register as a “foreign agent”. Kurmasheva, who works for
       the US-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty media outlet, was
       detained by law enforcement officers in the Russian city of Kazan.
     * Kyiv’s iconic Motherland statue representing a female warrior
       towering over the capital has reopened for public viewing after its
       Soviet-era hammer and sickle emblem was replaced with the Ukrainian
       trident.

Diplomacy

     * Biden and European Union leaders delivered a message of support for
       both Ukraine and Israel. “These conflicts show democracies must
       stand together,” European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen
       said of both countries. Biden said: “We stood together to support
       the brave people of Ukraine in the face of Putin’s aggression.
       We’re standing together now to support Israel in the wake of
       Hamas’s appalling terrorist attack.”

     * Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed claims by
       Ukrainian officials that Moscow has profited from the Israel-Hamas
       war, which had taken public attention away from Ukraine.

Military aid

     * Biden requested urgent military aid for Ukraine and Israel in a
       massive $106bn security package, which includes $61bn in military
       aid for Ukraine and $14bn in military aid for Israel.
     * North Korea has condemned the US for supplying Ukraine with
       long-range ATACMS ballistic  missiles.

Regional security

     * Russia’s defence ministry released a video showing a UK
       reconnaissance above the Black Sea being intercepted by Russian
       jets to prevent it from entering Russian airspace.
     * US intelligence reported that Russia is using its spy network,
       state-run media and social media platforms to undermine public
       trust in elections around the world.
     * The International Criminal Court (ICC) said an “unprecedented”
       cyberattack it suffered in September was probably “espionage” aimed
       at undermining its work. The attack comes as Russian investigators
       have opened criminal cases against the ICC’s prosecutor and judges
       who issued an arrest warrant for Putin for war crimes earlier this
       year.
