   World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or in
   historical contexts, the Great War, was a global conflict from 1914 to
   1918. It was fought between two coalitions: the Allied Powers and the
   Central Powers. Fighting took place throughout Europe, the Middle East,
   Africa, the Pacific, and parts of Asia. One of the deadliest wars in
   history, it resulted in an estimated 9 million soldiers dead and 23
   million wounded, plus another 5 million civilian deaths from various
   causes. Millions more died as a result of genocide, and the war was a
   major factor in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.

   The first decade of the 20th century saw increasing diplomatic tension
   between the European great powers. This reached a breaking point on 28
   June 1914, when a Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip assassinated
   Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne.
   Austria-Hungary held Serbia responsible, and declared war on 28 July.
   Russia came to Serbia's defence, and by 4 August, Germany, France, and
   Britain were drawn into the war, with the Ottoman Empire joining in
   November of that same year.

   Germany's strategy in 1914 was to first defeat France, then transfer
   forces to the Russian front. However, this failed, and by the end of
   1914, the Western Front consisted of a continuous line of trenches
   stretching from the English Channel to Switzerland. The Eastern Front
   was more dynamic, but neither side could gain a decisive advantage,
   despite costly offensives. As the war expanded to more fronts,
   Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Italy and others joined in from 1915 onward.

   In early 1917, the United States entered the war on the side of the
   Allies, and later the same year, the Bolsheviks seized power in the
   Russian October Revolution, making peace with the Central Powers in
   early 1918. Germany launched an offensive in the west in March 1918,
   and despite initial success, it left the German Army exhausted and
   demoralised. A successful Allied counter-offensive later that year
   caused a collapse of the German frontline. By the end of 1918,
   Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary agreed to armistices
   with the Allies, leaving Germany isolated. Facing revolution at home
   and with his army on the verge of mutiny, Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated
   on 9 November.

   Fighting ended with the Armistice of 11 November 1918, while the
   subsequent Paris Peace Conference imposed various settlements on the
   defeated powers, notably the Treaty of Versailles. The dissolution of
   the Russian, German, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman Empires resulted in
   the creation of new independent states, including Poland, Finland,
   Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The inability to manage post-war
   instability contributed to the outbreak of World War II in September
   1939.

Names

   The term world war was first coined in September 1914 by German
   biologist and philosopher Ernst Haeckel. He claimed that "there is no
   doubt that the course and character of the feared 'European War' ...
   will become the first world war in the full sense of the word,"^[1] in
   The Indianapolis Star on 20 September 1914.

   The term First World War had been used by Lt-Col. Charles à Court
   Repington, as a title for his memoirs (published in 1920); he had noted
   his discussion on the matter with a Major Johnstone of Harvard
   University in his diary entry of 10 September 1918.^[2]^[3]

   Prior to World War II, the events of 1914–1918 were generally known as
   the Great War or simply the World War.^[4] In August 1914, the magazine
   The Independent wrote "This is the Great War. It names itself".^[5] In
   October 1914, the Canadian magazine Maclean's similarly wrote, "Some
   wars name themselves. This is the Great War."^[6] Contemporary
   Europeans also referred to it as "the war to end war" and it was also
   described as "the war to end all wars" due to their perception of its
   unparalleled scale, devastation, and loss of life.^[7]

Background

   Main article: Causes of World War I

  Political and military alliances

   For much of the 19th century, the major European powers maintained a
   tenuous balance of power among themselves, known as the Concert of
   Europe.^[8] After 1848, this was challenged by a variety of factors,
   including Britain's withdrawal into so-called splendid isolation, the
   decline of the Ottoman Empire, New Imperialism, and the rise of Prussia
   under Otto von Bismarck. The 1866 Austro-Prussian War established
   Prussian hegemony in German states, while victory in the 1870–1871
   Franco-Prussian War allowed Bismarck to consolidate the German states
   into a German Empire under Prussian leadership. Avenging the defeat of
   1871, or revanchism, and recovering the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine
   became the principal objects of French policy for the next forty
   years.^[9]

     Triple Entente

     Triple Alliance

   In order to isolate France and avoid a war on two fronts, Bismarck
   negotiated the League of the Three Emperors (German: Dreikaiserbund)
   between Austria-Hungary, Russia and Germany. After Russian victory in
   the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War, the League was dissolved due to
   Austrian concerns over Russian influence in the Balkans, an area they
   considered of vital strategic interest. Germany and Austria-Hungary
   then formed the 1879 Dual Alliance, which became the Triple Alliance
   when Italy joined in 1882.^[10] For Bismarck, the purpose of these
   agreements was to isolate France by ensuring the three Empires resolved
   any disputes between themselves; when this was threatened in 1880 by
   British and French attempts to negotiate directly with Russia, he
   reformed the League in 1881, which was renewed in 1883 and 1885. After
   the agreement lapsed in 1887, he replaced it with the Reinsurance
   Treaty, a secret agreement between Germany and Russia to remain neutral
   if either were attacked by France or Austria-Hungary.^[11]

   Bismarck viewed peace with Russia as the foundation of German foreign
   policy but after becoming Kaiser in 1890, Wilhelm II forced him to
   retire and was persuaded not to renew the Reinsurance Treaty by his new
   Chancellor, Leo von Caprivi.^[12] This provided France an opportunity
   to counteract the Triple Alliance by signing the Franco-Russian
   Alliance in 1894, followed by the 1904 Entente Cordiale with Britain.
   The Triple Entente was completed by the 1907 Anglo-Russian Convention.
   While these were not formal alliances, by settling long-standing
   colonial disputes in Africa and Asia, the notion of British entry into
   any future conflict involving France or Russia became a
   possibility.^[13] British and Russian support for France against
   Germany during the Agadir Crisis in 1911 reinforced their relationship
   and increased Anglo-German estrangement, deepening the divisions that
   would erupt in 1914.^[14]

  Arms race

   German industrial strength and production significantly increased after
   1871, driven by the creation of a unified Reich, French indemnity
   payments, and the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine. Backed by Wilhelm II,
   Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz sought to use this growth in economic power
   to build a Kaiserliche Marine, or Imperial German Navy, which could
   compete with the British Royal Navy for world naval supremacy.^[15] His
   thinking was influenced by US naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, who
   argued possession of a blue-water navy was vital for global power
   projection; Tirpitz had his books translated into German, while Wilhelm
   made them required reading for his advisors and senior military
   personnel.^[16]

   However, it was also an emotional decision, driven by Wilhelm's
   simultaneous admiration for the Royal Navy and desire to outdo and
   surpass it. Bismarck thought that the British would not interfere in
   Europe, so long as its maritime supremacy remained secure, but his
   dismissal in 1890 led to a change in policy and an Anglo-German naval
   arms race began.^[17] Despite the vast sums spent by Tirpitz, the
   launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1906 gave the British a technological
   advantage over their German rivals which they never lost.^[15]
   Ultimately, the race diverted huge resources into creating a German
   navy large enough to antagonise Britain, but not defeat it; in 1911,
   Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg acknowledged defeat, leading
   to the Rüstungswende or 'armaments turning point', when he switched
   expenditure from the navy to the army.^[18]

   nd%22.jpg] SMS Rheinland, a Nassau-class battleship, Germany's first
   response to the British Dreadnought

   This decision was not driven by a reduction in political tensions, but
   German concern over Russia's quick recovery from its defeat in the
   Russo-Japanese War and subsequent 1905 Russian Revolution that same
   year. Economic reforms backed by funding from the French led to a
   significant post-1908 expansion of railways and transportation
   infrastructure, particularly in its western border regions.^[19] Since
   Germany and Austria-Hungary relied on faster mobilisation to compensate
   for their numerical inferiority compared to Russia, the threat posed by
   the closing of this gap was more important than competing with the
   Royal Navy. After Germany expanded its standing army by 170,000 troops
   in 1913, France extended compulsory military service from two to three
   years; similar measures were taken by the Balkan powers and Italy,
   which led to increased expenditure by the Ottomans and Austria-Hungary.
   Absolute figures are hard to calculate due to differences in
   categorising expenditure, since they often omit civilian infrastructure
   projects like railways which also had logistical importance and
   military use. It is known, however, that from 1908 to 1913, military
   spending by the six major European powers increased by over 50% in real
   terms.^[20]

  Conflicts in the Balkans

   proclamation of the Austrian annexation in 1908

   The years before 1914 were marked by a series of crises in the Balkans
   as other powers sought to benefit from Ottoman decline. While
   Pan-Slavic and Orthodox Russia considered itself the protector of
   Serbia and other Slav states, they preferred the strategically vital
   Bosporus straits to be controlled by a weak Ottoman government, rather
   than an ambitious Slav power like Bulgaria. Since Russia had its own
   ambitions in northeastern Anatolia and their clients had over-lapping
   claims in the Balkans, balancing these divided Russian policy-makers
   and added to regional instability.^[21]

   Austrian statesmen viewed the Balkans as essential for the continued
   existence of their Empire, and saw Serbian expansion as a direct
   threat. The 1908–1909 Bosnian Crisis began when Austria annexed the
   former Ottoman territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which it had
   occupied since 1878. Timed to coincide with the Bulgarian Declaration
   of Independence from the Ottoman Empire, this unilateral action was
   denounced by the European powers, but accepted as there was no
   consensus on how to resolve the situation. Some historians see this as
   a significant escalation, ending any chance of Austria co-operating
   with Russia in the Balkans while also damaging diplomatic relations
   between Serbia and Italy, both of whom had their own expansionist
   ambitions in the region.^[22]

   Tensions increased after the 1911–1912 Italo-Turkish War demonstrated
   Ottoman weakness and led to the formation of the Balkan League, an
   alliance of Serbia, Bulgaria, Montenegro, and Greece.^[23] The League
   quickly overran most of the Ottomans' territory in the Balkans during
   the 1912–1913 First Balkan War, much to the surprise of outside
   observers.^[24] The Serbian capture of ports on the Adriatic resulted
   in partial Austrian mobilisation starting on 21 November 1912,
   including units along the Russian border in Galicia. In a meeting the
   next day, the Russian government decided not to mobilise in response,
   unwilling to precipitate a war for which they were not as of yet
   prepared to handle.^[25]

   The Great Powers sought to re-assert control through the 1913 Treaty of
   London, which created an independent Albania, while enlarging the
   territories of Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Greece. However,
   disputes between the victors sparked the 33-day Second Balkan War, when
   Bulgaria attacked Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913; it was defeated,
   losing most of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece, and Southern Dobruja to
   Romania.^[26] The result was that even countries which benefited from
   the Balkan Wars, such as Serbia and Greece, felt cheated of their
   "rightful gains", while for Austria it demonstrated the apparent
   indifference with which other powers viewed their concerns, including
   Germany.^[27] This complex mix of resentment, nationalism and
   insecurity helps explain why the pre-1914 Balkans became known as the
   "powder keg of Europe".^[28]

  Sarajevo assassination

   Main article: Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand

   [220px-Gavrilo_Princip_captured_in_Sarajevo_1914.jpg] Traditionally
   thought to show the arrest of Gavrilo Princip (right), this photo is
   now believed by historians to depict an innocent bystander, Ferdinand
   Behr^[29]^[30]

   Summer 1914 the sovereigns of Europe were woven together by treaties,
   alliances, as well as secret agreements. The Triple Alliance (1882)
   encompassed the German Empire, Austria, and Italy.^[31]

   On 28 June 1914 Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive
   to Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, visited Sarajevo, capital of the
   recently annexed provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The assassins
   Cvjetko Popović, Gavrilo Princip, Nedeljko Čabrinović, Trifko Grabež,
   and Vaso Čubrilović were Bosnian Serbs, while Muhamed Mehmedbašić was
   from the Bosniaks community^[32] from the movement known as Young
   Bosnia, or Mlada Bosna, took up positions along the route taken by the
   Archduke's motorcade, with the intention of assassinating him. Supplied
   with arms by extremists within the Serbian Black Hand intelligence
   organisation, they hoped his death would free Bosnia from Austrian
   rule, although there was little agreement on what would replace
   it.^[33]

   Nedeljko Čabrinović threw a grenade at the Archduke's car and injured
   two of his aides, who were taken to hospital while the convoy carried
   on. The other assassins were also unsuccessful but an hour later, as
   Ferdinand was returning from visiting the injured officers, his car
   took a wrong turn into a street where Gavrilo Princip was standing. He
   stepped forward and fired two pistol shots, fatally wounding Ferdinand
   and his wife Sophie, who both died shortly thereafter.^[34] Although
   Emperor Franz Joseph was shocked by the incident, political and
   personal differences meant the two men were not close; allegedly, his
   first reported comment was "A higher power has re-established the order
   which I, alas, could not preserve".^[35]

   According to historian Zbyněk Zeman, his reaction was reflected more
   broadly in Vienna, where "the event almost failed to make any
   impression whatsoever. On 28 and 29 June, the crowds listened to music
   and drank wine, as if nothing had happened."^[36] Nevertheless, the
   impact of the murder of the heir to the throne was significant, and has
   been described by historian Christopher Clark as a "9/11 effect, a
   terrorist event charged with historic meaning, transforming the
   political chemistry in Vienna".^[37]

  Expansion of violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina

   [220px-1914-06-29_-_Aftermath_of_attacks_against_Serbs_in_Sarajevo.png]
   Crowds on the streets in the aftermath of the anti-Serb riots in
   Sarajevo, 29 June 1914

   The Austro-Hungarian authorities encouraged the subsequent anti-Serb
   riots in Sarajevo, in which Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks killed two
   Bosnian Serbs and damaged numerous Serb-owned buildings.^[38]^[39]
   Violent actions against ethnic Serbs were also organised outside
   Sarajevo, in other cities in Austro-Hungarian-controlled Bosnia and
   Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia. Austro-Hungarian authorities in
   Bosnia and Herzegovina imprisoned and extradited approximately 5,500
   prominent Serbs, 700 to 2,200 of whom died in prison. A further 460
   Serbs were sentenced to death. A predominantly Bosniak special militia
   known as the Schutzkorps was established and carried out the
   persecution of Serbs.^[40]^[41]^[42]^[43]

  July Crisis

   Main articles: July Crisis, German entry into World War I,
   Austro-Hungarian entry into World War I, and Russian entry into World
   War I

   The assassination initiated the July Crisis, a month of diplomatic
   manoeuvring between Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France and
   Britain. Believing Serbian intelligence helped organise Franz
   Ferdinand's murder, Austrian officials wanted to use the opportunity to
   end their interference in Bosnia and saw war as the best way of
   achieving this.^[44] However, the Foreign Ministry had no solid proof
   of Serbian involvement and a dossier used to make its case contained
   multiple errors.^[45] On 23 July, Austria delivered an ultimatum to
   Serbia, listing ten demands made intentionally unacceptable to provide
   an excuse for starting hostilities.^[46]
   [310px-Austria_Hungary_ethnic.svg.png] Ethno-linguistic map of
   Austria-Hungary, 1910. Bosnia-Herzegovina was annexed in 1908.

   Serbia ordered general mobilisation on 25 July, but accepted all the
   terms, except for those empowering Austrian representatives to suppress
   "subversive elements" inside Serbia, and take part in the investigation
   and trial of Serbians linked to the assassination.^[47]^[48] Claiming
   this amounted to rejection, Austria broke off diplomatic relations and
   ordered partial mobilisation the next day; on 28 July, they declared
   war on Serbia and began shelling Belgrade. Having initiated war
   preparations on 25 July, Russia now ordered general mobilisation in
   support of Serbia on 30th.^[49]

   Anxious to ensure backing from the SPD political opposition by
   presenting Russia as the aggressor, German Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg
   delayed commencement of war preparations until 31 July.^[50] That
   afternoon the Russian government were handed a note requiring them to
   "cease all war measures against Germany and Austria-Hungary" within 12
   hours.^[51] A further German demand for neutrality was refused by the
   French who ordered general mobilisation but delayed declaring war.^[52]
   The German General Staff had long assumed they faced a war on two
   fronts; the Schlieffen Plan envisaged using 80% of the army to defeat
   France in the west, then switch to Russia. Since this required them to
   move quickly, mobilisation orders were issued that afternoon.^[53]
   [220px-The_War_of_the_Nations_WW1_337.jpg] Cheering crowds in London
   and Paris on the day war was declared.

   At a meeting on 29 July, the British cabinet had narrowly decided its
   obligations to Belgium under the 1839 Treaty of London did not require
   it to oppose a German invasion with military force. However, this was
   largely driven by Prime Minister Asquith's desire to maintain unity; he
   and his senior Cabinet ministers were already committed to support
   France, the Royal Navy had been mobilised and public opinion was
   strongly in favour of intervention.^[54] On 31 July, Britain sent notes
   to Germany and France, asking them to respect Belgian neutrality;
   France pledged to do so, Germany did not reply.^[55]

   Once the German ultimatum to Russia expired on the morning of 1 August,
   the two countries were at war. Later the same day, Wilhelm was informed
   by his ambassador in London, Prince Lichnowsky, that Britain would
   remain neutral if France was not attacked, and might not intervene at
   all given the ongoing Home Rule Crisis in Ireland.^[56] Jubilant at
   this news, he ordered General Moltke, the German chief of staff, to
   "march the whole of the ... army to the East". This allegedly brought
   Moltke to the verge of a nervous breakdown, before Lichnowsky realised
   he was mistaken. Once Wilhelm received a telegram from George V, it
   confirmed there had been a misunderstanding, and he told Moltke, "Now
   do what you want."^[57]

   Aware of German plans to attack through Belgium, French
   Commander-in-Chief Joseph Joffre asked his government for permission to
   cross the border and pre-empt such a move. To avoid a violation of
   Belgian neutrality, he was told any advance could come only after a
   German invasion.^[58] On 2 August, Germany occupied Luxembourg and
   exchanged fire with French units; on 3 August, they declared war on
   France and demanded free passage across Belgium, which was refused.
   Early on the morning of 4 August, the Germans invaded and Albert I of
   Belgium called for assistance under the Treaty of London.^[59]^[60]
   Britain sent Germany an ultimatum demanding they withdraw from Belgium;
   when this expired at midnight without a response, the two empires were
   at war.^[61]

  Opening hostilities

    Confusion among the Central Powers

   The strategy of the Central Powers suffered from miscommunication.
   Germany had promised to support Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia,
   but interpretations of what this meant differed. Previously tested
   deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914, but those had never
   been tested in exercises. Austro-Hungarian leaders believed Germany
   would cover its northern flank against Russia.^[62]

    Serbian campaign

   Main article: Serbian campaign

   [220px-FirstSerbianArmedPlane1915.jpg] Serbian Army Blériot XI "Oluj",
   1915

   Beginning on 12 August, the Austrian and Serbs clashed at the battles
   of the Cer and Kolubara; over the next two weeks, Austrian attacks were
   repulsed with heavy losses, dashing their hopes of a swift victory and
   marking the first major Allied victories of the war. As a result,
   Austria had to keep sizeable forces on the Serbian front, weakening its
   efforts against Russia.^[63] Serbia's defeat of the 1914 invasion has
   been called one of the major upset victories of the twentieth
   century.^[64] In spring 1915, the campaign saw the first use of
   anti-aircraft warfare after an Austrian plane was shot down with
   ground-to-air fire, as well as the first medical evacuation by the
   Serbian army in autumn 1915.^[65]^[66]

    German offensive in Belgium and France

   Main article: Great Retreat

   [220px-German_soldiers_in_a_railroad_car_on_the_way_to_the_front_during

   German soldiers on the way to the front in 1914; at this stage, all
   sides expected the conflict to be a short one.

   Upon mobilisation in 1914, 80% of the German Army was located on the
   Western Front, with the remainder acting as a screening force in the
   East; officially titled Aufmarsch II West, it is better known as the
   Schlieffen Plan after its creator, Alfred von Schlieffen, head of the
   German General Staff from 1891 to 1906. Rather than a direct attack
   across their shared frontier, the German right wing would sweep through
   the Netherlands and Belgium, then swing south, encircling Paris and
   trapping the French army against the Swiss border. Schlieffen estimated
   this would take six weeks, after which the German army would transfer
   to the East and defeat the Russians.^[67]

   The plan was substantially modified by his successor, Helmuth von
   Moltke the Younger. Under Schlieffen, 85% of German forces in the west
   were assigned to the right wing, with the remainder holding along the
   frontier. By keeping his left wing deliberately weak, he hoped to lure
   the French into an offensive into the "lost provinces" of
   Alsace-Lorraine, which was in fact the strategy envisaged by their Plan
   XVII.^[67] However, Moltke grew concerned the French might push too
   hard on his left flank and as the German Army increased in size from
   1908 to 1914, he changed the allocation of forces between the two wings
   from 85:15 to 70:30.^[68] He also considered Dutch neutrality essential
   for German trade and cancelled the incursion into the Netherlands,
   which meant any delays in Belgium threatened the entire viability of
   the plan.^[69] Historian Richard Holmes argues these changes meant the
   right wing was not strong enough to achieve decisive success and thus
   led to unrealistic goals and timings.^[70]
   [220px-Georges_Scott%2C_A_la_ba%C3%AFonnette_%21.jpg] French bayonet
   charge during the Battle of the Frontiers; by the end of August, French
   casualties exceeded 260,000, including 75,000 dead.

   The initial German advance in the West was very successful and by the
   end of August the Allied left, which included the British Expeditionary
   Force (BEF), was in full retreat. At the same time, the French
   offensive in Alsace-Lorraine was a disastrous failure, with casualties
   exceeding 260,000, including 27,000 killed on 22 August during the
   Battle of the Frontiers.^[71] German planning provided broad strategic
   instructions, while allowing army commanders considerable freedom in
   carrying them out at the front; this worked well in 1866 and 1870 but
   in 1914, von Kluck used this freedom to disobey orders, opening a gap
   between the German armies as they closed on Paris.^[72]

   In 1911, the Russian Stavka had agreed with the French to attack
   Germany within fifteen days of mobilisation, ten days before the
   Germans had anticipated, although it meant the two Russian armies that
   entered East Prussia on 17 August did so without many of their support
   elements.^[73]

   By the end of 1914, German troops held strong defensive positions
   inside France, controlled the bulk of France's domestic coalfields and
   had inflicted 230,000 more casualties than it lost itself. However,
   communications problems and questionable command decisions cost Germany
   the chance of a decisive outcome, while it had failed to achieve the
   primary objective of avoiding a long, two-front war.^[74] As was
   apparent to a number of German leaders, this amounted to a strategic
   defeat; shortly after the Marne, Crown Prince Wilhelm told an American
   reporter; "We have lost the war. It will go on for a long time but lost
   it is already."^[75]

    Asia and the Pacific

   Main article: Asian and Pacific theatre of World War I

   [310px-World_1914_empires_colonies_territory.PNG] World empires and
   colonies around 1914

   On 30 August 1914, New Zealand occupied German Samoa, now the
   independent state of Samoa. On 11 September, the Australian Naval and
   Military Expeditionary Force landed on the island of New Britain, then
   part of German New Guinea. On 28 October, the German cruiser SMS Emden
   sank the Russian cruiser Zhemchug in the Battle of Penang. Japan
   declared war on Germany prior to seizing territories in the Pacific
   which later became the South Seas Mandate, as well as German Treaty
   ports on the Chinese Shandong peninsula at Tsingtao. After Vienna
   refused to withdraw its cruiser SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth from Tsingtao,
   Japan declared war on Austria-Hungary as well, and the ship was sunk at
   Tsingtao in November 1914.^[76] Within a few months, Allied forces had
   seized all German territories in the Pacific, leaving only isolated
   commerce raiders and a few holdouts in New Guinea.^[77]^[78]

    African campaigns

   Main article: African theatre of World War I

   Some of the first clashes of the war involved British, French, and
   German colonial forces in Africa. On 6–7 August, French and British
   troops invaded the German protectorate of Togoland and Kamerun. On 10
   August, German forces in South-West Africa attacked South Africa;
   sporadic and fierce fighting continued for the rest of the war. The
   German colonial forces in German East Africa, led by Colonel Paul von
   Lettow-Vorbeck, fought a guerrilla warfare campaign during World War I
   and only surrendered two weeks after the armistice took effect in
   Europe.^[79]

    Indian support for the Allies

   d_war_2.jpg] British Indian Army infantry divisions in France; these
   troops were withdrawn in December 1915, and served in the Mesopotamian
   campaign.

   Prior to the war, Germany had attempted to use Indian nationalism and
   pan-Islamism to its advantage, a policy continued post-1914 by
   instigating uprisings in India, while the Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition
   urged Afghanistan to join the war on the side of Central Powers.
   However, contrary to British fears of a revolt in India, the outbreak
   of the war saw a reduction in nationalist activity.^[80]^[81] This was
   largely because leaders from the Indian National Congress and other
   groups believed support for the British war effort would hasten Indian
   Home Rule, a promise allegedly made explicit in 1917 by Edwin Montagu,
   the Secretary of State for India.^[82]

   In 1914, the British Indian Army was larger than the British Army
   itself, and between 1914 and 1918 an estimated 1.3 million Indian
   soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East,
   while the Government of India and their princely allies supplied large
   quantities of food, money, and ammunition. In all, 140,000 soldiers
   served on the Western Front and nearly 700,000 in the Middle East, with
   47,746 killed and 65,126 wounded.^[83]

   The suffering engendered by the war, as well as the failure of the
   British government to grant self-government to India after the end of
   hostilities, bred disillusionment and resulted in the campaign for full
   independence led by Mahatma Gandhi.^[84]

    Trench warfare begins

   Pre-war military tactics that emphasised open warfare and the
   individual rifleman proved obsolete when confronted with conditions
   prevailing in 1914. Technological advances allowed the creation of
   strong defensive systems largely impervious to massed infantry
   advances, such as barbed wire, machine guns and above all far more
   powerful artillery, which dominated the battlefield and made crossing
   open ground extremely difficult.^[85] Both sides struggled to develop
   tactics for breaching entrenched positions without suffering heavy
   casualties. In time, however, technology enabled the production of new
   offensive weapons, such as gas warfare and the tank.^[86]

   After the First Battle of the Marne in September 1914, Allied and
   German forces unsuccessfully tried to outflank each other, a series of
   manoeuvres later known as the "Race to the Sea". By the end of 1914,
   the opposing forces confronted each other along an uninterrupted line
   of entrenched positions from the Channel to the Swiss border.^[87]
   Since the Germans were normally able to choose where to stand, they
   generally held the high ground, while their trenches tended to be
   better built; those constructed by the French and English were
   initially considered "temporary", only needed until an offensive would
   smash the German defences.^[88] Both sides tried to break the stalemate
   using scientific and technological advances. On 22 April 1915, at the
   Second Battle of Ypres, the Germans (violating the Hague Convention)
   used chlorine gas for the first time on the Western Front. Several
   types of gas soon became widely used by both sides, and though it never
   proved a decisive, battle-winning weapon, it became one of the
   most-feared and best-remembered horrors of the war.^[89]^[90]

    Continuation of trench warfare

   [220px-The_Battle_of_the_Somme%2C_July-november_1916_Q4218.jpg] German
   casualties at the Somme, 1916

   In February 1916 the Germans attacked French defensive positions at the
   Battle of Verdun, lasting until December 1916. The Germans made initial
   gains, before French counter-attacks returned matters to near their
   starting point. Casualties were greater for the French, but the Germans
   bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000^[91] to 975,000^[92]
   casualties suffered between the two combatants. Verdun became a symbol
   of French determination and self-sacrifice.^[93]

   The Battle of the Somme was an Anglo-French offensive of July to
   November 1916. The opening day on 1 July 1916 was the bloodiest single
   day in the history of the British Army, which suffered 57,470
   casualties, including 19,240 dead. As a whole, the Somme offensive led
   to an estimated 420,000 British casualties, along with 200,000 French
   and 500,000 German.^[94] Gun fire was not the only factor taking lives;
   the diseases that emerged in the trenches were a major killer on both
   sides. The living conditions made it so that countless diseases and
   infections occurred, such as trench foot, shell shock, blindness/burns
   from mustard gas, lice, trench fever, "cooties" (body lice) and the
   'Spanish flu'.^[citation needed]

  Naval war

   Main article: Naval warfare of World War I

   [220px-Hochseeflotte_2.jpg] Battleships of the Hochseeflotte, 1917

   At the start of the war, German cruisers were scattered across the
   globe, some of which were subsequently used to attack Allied merchant
   shipping. These were systematically hunted down by the Royal Navy,
   although not before causing considerable damage. One of the most
   successful was the SMS Emden, part of the German East Asia Squadron
   stationed at Qingdao, which seized or sank 15 merchantmen, as well as a
   Russian cruiser and a French destroyer. Most of the squadron was
   returning to Germany when it sank two British armoured cruisers at the
   Battle of Coronel in November 1914, before being virtually destroyed at
   the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December. The SMS Dresden escaped
   with a few auxiliaries, but after the Battle of Más a Tierra, these too
   were either destroyed or interned.^[95]

   Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade
   of Germany. This proved effective in cutting off vital military and
   civilian supplies, although it violated accepted international law
   codified by several international agreements of the past two
   centuries.^[96] Britain also mined international waters which closed
   off entire sections of ocean, even to neutral ships.^[97] Since there
   was limited response to this tactic of the British, Germany expected a
   similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.^[98]

   The Battle of Jutland ^[k] in May/June 1916 was the only full-scale
   clash of battleships during the war, and one of the largest in history.
   The clash was indecisive, although the Germans inflicted more damage
   than they received, since thereafter the bulk of the German High Seas
   Fleet was confined to port for the duration of the war.^[99]
   [220px-NationaalArchief_uboat155London.jpg] U-155 exhibited near Tower
   Bridge in London, after the 1918 Armistice

   German U-boats attempted to cut the supply lines between North America
   and Britain.^[100] The nature of submarine warfare meant that attacks
   often came without warning, giving the crews of the merchant ships
   little hope of survival.^[100]^[101] The United States launched a
   protest, and Germany changed its rules of engagement. After the sinking
   of the passenger ship RMS Lusitania in 1915, Germany promised not to
   target passenger liners, while Britain armed its merchant ships,
   placing them beyond the protection of the "cruiser rules", which
   demanded warning and movement of crews to "a place of safety" (a
   standard that lifeboats did not meet).^[102] Finally, in early 1917,
   Germany adopted a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, realising
   the Americans would eventually enter the war.^[100]^[103] Germany
   sought to strangle Allied sea lanes before the United States could
   transport a large army overseas, but after initial successes eventually
   failed to do so.^[100]

   The U-boat threat lessened in 1917, when merchant ships began
   travelling in convoys, escorted by destroyers. This tactic made it
   difficult for U-boats to find targets, which significantly lessened
   losses; after the hydrophone and depth charges were introduced,
   accompanying destroyers could attack a submerged submarine with some
   hope of success. Convoys slowed the flow of supplies since ships had to
   wait as convoys were assembled. The solution to the delays was an
   extensive program of building new freighters. Troopships were too fast
   for the submarines and did not travel the North Atlantic in
   convoys.^[104] The U-boats had sunk more than 5,000 Allied ships, at a
   cost of 199 submarines.^[105]

   World War I also saw the first use of aircraft carriers in combat, with
   HMS Furious launching Sopwith Camels in a successful raid against the
   Zeppelin hangars at Tondern in July 1918, as well as blimps for
   antisubmarine patrol.^[106]

   Faced with Russia in the east, Austria-Hungary could spare only
   one-third of its army to attack Serbia. After suffering heavy losses,
   the Austrians briefly occupied the Serbian capital, Belgrade. A Serbian
   counter-attack in the Battle of Kolubara succeeded in driving them from
   the country by the end of 1914. For the first ten months of 1915,
   Austria-Hungary used most of its military reserves to fight Italy.
   German and Austro-Hungarian diplomats, however, scored a coup by
   persuading Bulgaria to join the attack on Serbia.^[107] The
   Austro-Hungarian provinces of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia provided
   troops for Austria-Hungary in the fight with Serbia, Russia and Italy.
   Montenegro allied itself with Serbia.^[108]

   Bulgaria declared war on Serbia on 14 October 1915 and joined in the
   attack by the Austro-Hungarian army under Mackensen's army of 250,000
   that was already underway. Serbia was conquered in a little more than a
   month, as the Central Powers, now including Bulgaria, sent in 600,000
   troops total. The Serbian army, fighting on two fronts and facing
   certain defeat, retreated into northern Albania. The Serbs suffered
   defeat in the Battle of Kosovo. Montenegro covered the Serbian retreat
   towards the Adriatic coast in the Battle of Mojkovac in 6–7 January
   1916, but ultimately the Austrians also conquered Montenegro. The
   surviving Serbian soldiers were evacuated by ship to Greece.^[109]
   After conquest, Serbia was divided between Austro-Hungary and
   Bulgaria.^[110]

   In late 1915, a Franco-British force landed at Salonica in Greece to
   offer assistance and to pressure its government to declare war against
   the Central Powers. However, the pro-German King Constantine I
   dismissed the pro-Allied government of Eleftherios Venizelos before the
   Allied expeditionary force arrived.^[111]

   The Macedonian front was initially mostly static. French and Serbian
   forces retook limited areas of Macedonia by recapturing Bitola on 19
   November 1916 following the costly Monastir offensive, which brought
   stabilisation of the front.^[112]
   [220px-Austrians_executing_Serbs_1917.JPG] Austro-Hungarian troops
   executing captured Serbians, 1917. Serbia lost about 850,000 people
   during the war, a quarter of its pre-war population.^[113]

   Serbian and French troops finally made a breakthrough in September 1918
   in the Vardar offensive, after most of the German and Austro-Hungarian
   troops had been withdrawn. The Bulgarians were defeated at the Battle
   of Dobro Pole, and by 25 September British and French troops had
   crossed the border into Bulgaria proper as the Bulgarian army
   collapsed. Bulgaria capitulated four days later, on 29 September
   1918.^[114] The German high command responded by despatching troops to
   hold the line, but these forces were far too weak to re-establish a
   front.^[115]

   The disappearance of the Macedonian front meant that the road to
   Budapest and Vienna was now opened to Allied forces. Hindenburg and
   Ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now
   shifted decidedly against the Central Powers and, a day after the
   Bulgarian collapse, insisted on an immediate peace settlement.^[116]

    Ottoman Empire

   Gallipoli Campaign

   The Ottomans threatened Russia's Caucasian territories and Britain's
   communications with India via the Suez Canal. As the conflict
   progressed, the Ottoman Empire took advantage of the European powers'
   preoccupation with the war and conducted large-scale ethnic cleansing
   of the indigenous Armenian, Greek, and Assyrian Christian populations,
   known as the Armenian genocide, Greek genocide, and Sayfo
   respectively.^[117]^[118]^[119]

   The British and French opened overseas fronts with the Gallipoli (1915)
   and Mesopotamian campaigns (1914). In Gallipoli, the Ottoman Empire
   successfully repelled the British, French, and Australian and New
   Zealand Army Corps (ANZACs). In Mesopotamia, by contrast, after the
   defeat of the British defenders in the siege of Kut by the Ottomans
   (1915–16), British Imperial forces reorganised and captured Baghdad in
   March 1917. The British were aided in Mesopotamia by local Arab and
   Assyrian fighters, while the Ottomans employed local Kurdish and
   Turcoman tribes.^[120]

   Further to the west, the Suez Canal was defended from Ottoman attacks
   in 1915 and 1916; in August, a German and Ottoman force was defeated at
   the Battle of Romani by the ANZAC Mounted Division and the 52nd
   (Lowland) Infantry Division. Following this victory, an Egyptian
   Expeditionary Force advanced across the Sinai Peninsula, pushing
   Ottoman forces back in the Battle of Magdhaba in December and the
   Battle of Rafa on the border between the Egyptian Sinai and Ottoman
   Palestine in January 1917.^[121]
   [220px-Sarikam.jpg] Russian forest trench at the Battle of Sarikamish,

   Russian armies generally had success in the Caucasus campaign. Enver
   Pasha, supreme commander of the Ottoman armed forces, was ambitious and
   dreamed of re-conquering central Asia and areas that had been lost to
   Russia previously. He was, however, a poor commander.^[122] He launched
   an offensive against the Russians in the Caucasus in December 1914 with
   100,000 troops, insisting on a frontal attack against mountainous
   Russian positions in winter. He lost 86% of his force at the Battle of
   Sarikamish.^[123]
   [220px-Ottoman_15th_Corps.jpg] Kaiser Wilhelm II and Prince Leopold of

   The Ottoman Empire, with German support, invaded Persia (modern Iran)
   in December 1914 in an effort to cut off British and Russian access to
   petroleum reservoirs around Baku near the Caspian Sea.^[124] Persia,
   ostensibly neutral, had long been under the spheres of British and
   Russian influence. The Ottomans and Germans were aided by Kurdish and
   Azeri forces, together with a large number of major Iranian tribes,
   such as the Qashqai, Tangistanis, Lurs, and Khamseh, while the Russians
   and British had the support of Armenian and Assyrian forces. The
   Persian campaign was to last until 1918 and end in failure for the
   Ottomans and their allies. However, the Russian withdrawal from the war
   in 1917 led to Armenian and Assyrian forces, who had hitherto inflicted
   a series of defeats upon the forces of the Ottomans and their allies,
   being cut off from supply lines, outnumbered, outgunned and isolated,
   forcing them to fight and flee towards British lines in northern
   Mesopotamia.^[125]

   General Yudenich, the Russian commander from 1915 to 1916, drove the
   Turks out of most of the southern Caucasus with a string of
   victories.^[123]

   The Arab Revolt, instigated by the Arab bureau of the British Foreign
   Office, started June 1916 with the Battle of Mecca, led by Sharif
   Hussein of Mecca, and ended with the Ottoman surrender of Damascus.
   Fakhri Pasha, the Ottoman commander of Medina, resisted for more than
   two and half years during the siege of Medina before surrendering in
   January 1919.^[126]

   The Senussi tribe, along the border of Italian Libya and British Egypt,
   incited and armed by the Turks, waged a small-scale guerrilla war
   against Allied troops. The British were forced to dispatch 12,000
   troops to oppose them in the Senussi campaign. Their rebellion was
   finally crushed in mid-1916.^[127]

   Total Allied casualties on the Ottoman fronts amounted 650,000 men.
   Total Ottoman casualties were 725,000, with 325,000 dead and 400,000
   wounded.^[128]

   [220px-Italian_Front_1915-1917.jpg] Isonzo Offensives 1915–1917

   Although Italy joined the Triple Alliance in 1882, a treaty with its
   traditional Austrian enemy was so controversial that subsequent
   governments denied its existence and the terms were only made public in
   1915.^[129] This arose from nationalist designs on Austro-Hungarian
   territory in Trentino, the Austrian Littoral, Rijeka and Dalmatia,
   which were considered vital to secure the borders established in
   1866.^[130] In 1902, Rome secretly agreed with France to remain neutral
   if the latter was attacked by Germany, effectively nullifying its role
   in the Triple Alliance.^[131]

   When the war began in 1914, Italy argued the Triple Alliance was
   defensive in nature and it was not obliged to support an Austrian
   attack on Serbia. Opposition to joining the Central Powers increased
   when Turkey became a member in September, since in 1911 Italy had
   occupied Ottoman possessions in Libya and the Dodecanese islands.^[132]
   To secure Italian neutrality, the Central Powers offered them the
   French protectorate of Tunisia, while in return for an immediate entry
   into the war, the Allies agreed to their demands for Austrian territory
   and sovereignty over the Dodecanese.^[133] Although they remained
   secret, these provisions were incorporated into the April 1915 Treaty
   of London; Italy joined the Triple Entente and on 23 May declared war
   on Austria-Hungary,^[134] followed by Germany fifteen months later.
   [220px-1917_ortler_vorgipfelstellung_3850_m_highest_trench_in_history_o
   f_first_world_war.jpg] Austro-Hungarian trench at 3,850 metres in the
   Ortler Alps, one of the most challenging fronts of the war

   The pre-1914 Italian army was the weakest in Europe, short of officers,
   trained men, adequate transport and modern weapons; by April 1915, some
   of these deficiencies had been remedied but it was still unprepared for
   the major offensive required by the Treaty of London.^[135] The
   advantage of superior numbers was offset by the difficult terrain; much
   of the fighting took place at altitudes of over 3000 metres in the Alps
   and Dolomites, where trench lines had to be cut through rock and ice
   and keeping troops supplied was a major challenge. These issues were
   exacerbated by unimaginative strategies and tactics.^[136] Between 1915
   and 1917, the Italian commander, Luigi Cadorna, undertook a series of
   frontal assaults along the Isonzo which made little progress and cost
   many lives; by the end of the war, total Italian combat deaths totalled
   around 548,000.^[137]

   In the spring of 1916, the Austro-Hungarians counterattacked in Asiago
   in the Strafexpedition, but made little progress and were pushed by the
   Italians back to the Tyrol.^[138] Although an Italian corps occupied
   southern Albania in May 1916, their main focus was the Isonzo front
   which after the capture of Gorizia in August 1916 remained static until
   October 1917. After a combined Austro-German force won a major victory
   at Caporetto, Cadorna was replaced by Armando Diaz who retreated more
   than 100 kilometres (62 mi) before holding positions along the Piave
   River.^[139] A second Austrian offensive was repulsed in June 1918 and
   by October it was clear the Central Powers had lost the war. On 24
   October, Diaz launched the Battle of Vittorio Veneto and initially met
   stubborn resistance, ^[140] but with Austria-Hungary collapsing,
   Hungarian divisions in Italy now demanded they be sent home.^[141] When
   this was granted, many others followed and the Imperial army
   disintegrated, the Italians taking over 300,000 prisoners.^[142] On
   3 November, the Armistice of Villa Giusti ended hostilities between
   Austria-Hungary and Italy which occupied Trieste and areas along the
   Adriatic Sea awarded to it in 1915.^[143]

  Eastern Front

    Initial actions

   [220px-Mikolaj_II_w_Twierdzy_Przemysl.jpg] Emperor Nicholas II and
   Grand Duke Nikolaevich following the Russian capture of Przemyśl, the
   longest siege of the war.

   As previously agreed with France, Russian plans at the start of the war
   were to simultaneously advance into Austrian Galicia and East Prussia
   as soon as possible. Although their attack on Galicia was largely
   successful, and the invasions achieved their aim of forcing Germany to
   divert troops from the Western Front, the speed of mobilisation meant
   they did so without much of their heavy equipment and support
   functions. These weaknesses contributed to Russian defeats at
   Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes in August and September 1914, forcing
   them to withdraw from East Prussia with heavy losses.^[144]^[145] By
   spring 1915, they had also retreated from Galicia, and the May 1915
   Gorlice–Tarnów offensive then allowed the Central Powers to invade
   Russian-occupied Poland.^[146]

   Despite the successful June 1916 Brusilov offensive against the
   Austrians in eastern Galicia,^[147] shortages of supplies, heavy losses
   and command failures prevented the Russians from fully exploiting their
   victory. However, it was one of the most significant and impactful
   offensives of the war, diverting German resources from Verdun,
   relieving Austro-Hungarian pressure on the Italians, and convincing
   Romania to enter the war on the side of the Allies on 27 August. It
   also fatally weakened both the Austrian and Russian armies, whose
   offensive capabilities were badly affected by their losses and
   increased the disillusionment with the war that ultimately led to the
   Russian revolutions.^[148]

   Meanwhile, unrest grew in Russia as the Tsar remained at the front,
   with the home front controlled by Empress Alexandra. Her increasingly
   incompetent rule and food shortages in urban areas led to widespread
   protests and the murder of her favourite, Grigori Rasputin, at the end
   of 1916.^[149]

   Romania key locations 1916–1918 (note; using 2022 borders)

   Despite secretly agreeing to support the Triple Alliance in 1883,
   Romania increasingly found itself at odds with the Central Powers over
   their support for Bulgaria in the 1912 to 1913 Balkan Wars and the
   status of ethnic Romanian communities in Hungarian-controlled
   Transylvania,^[150] which comprised an estimated 2.8 million of the 5.0
   million population.^[151] With the ruling elite split into pro-German
   and pro-Entente factions, Romania remained neutral in 1914, arguing
   like Italy that because Austria-Hungary had declared war on Serbia, it
   was under no obligation to join them.^[152] They maintained this
   position for the next two years, while allowing Germany and Austria to
   transport military supplies and advisors across Romanian
   territory.^[153]

   In September 1914, Russia had acknowledged Romanian rights to
   Austro-Hungarian territories including Transylvania and Banat, whose
   acquisition had widespread popular support, ^[151] and Russian success
   against Austria led Romania to join the Entente in the August 1916
   Treaty of Bucharest.^[153] Under the strategic plan known as Hypothesis
   Z, the Romanian army planned an offensive into Transylvania, while
   defending Southern Dobruja and Giurgiu against a possible Bulgarian
   counterattack.^[154] On 27 August 1916, they attacked Transylvania and
   occupied substantial parts of the province before being driven back by
   the recently formed German 9th Army, led by former Chief of Staff
   Falkenhayn.^[155] A combined German-Bulgarian-Turkish offensive
   captured Dobruja and Giurgiu, although the bulk of the Romanian army
   managed to escape encirclement and retreated to Bucharest, which
   surrendered to the Central Powers on 6 December 1916.^[156]

   On 7 May 1918 Romania signed the Treaty of Bucharest with the Central
   Powers, which recognised Romanian sovereignty over Bessarabia in return
   for ceding control of passes in the Carpathian Mountains to
   Austria-Hungary and granting oil concessions to Germany.^[157] Romania
   re-entered the war on 10 November 1918 on the side of the Allies and
   the Treaty of Bucharest was formally annulled by the Armistice of 11
   November 1918.^[158]^[l]

  Central Powers peace overtures

   [220px-River_Crossing_NGM-v31-p338.jpg] "They shall not pass", a phrase
   typically associated with the defence of Verdun

   On 12 December 1916, after ten brutal months of the Battle of Verdun
   and a successful offensive against Romania, Germany attempted to
   negotiate a peace with the Allies.^[160] However, this attempt was
   rejected out of hand as a "duplicitous war ruse".^[160]

   Soon after, US president Woodrow Wilson attempted to intervene as a
   peacemaker, asking in a note for both sides to state their demands and
   start negotiations. Lloyd George's War Cabinet considered the German
   offer to be a ploy to create divisions amongst the Allies. After
   initial outrage and much deliberation, they took Wilson's note as a
   separate effort, signalling that the United States was on the verge of
   entering the war against Germany following the "submarine outrages".
   While the Allies debated a response to Wilson's offer, the Germans
   chose to rebuff it in favour of "a direct exchange of views". Learning
   of the German response, the Allied governments were free to make clear
   demands in their response of 14 January. They sought restoration of
   damages, the evacuation of occupied territories, reparations for
   France, Russia and Romania, and a recognition of the principle of
   nationalities.^[161] This included the liberation of Italians, Slavs,
   Romanians, Czecho-Slovaks, and the creation of a "free and united
   Poland".^[161] On the question of security, the Allies sought
   guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars, complete with
   sanctions, as a condition of any peace settlement.^[162] The
   negotiations failed and the Entente powers rejected the German offer on
   the grounds that Germany had not put forward any specific
   proposals.^[citation needed]

  Final years of the war

    Russian Revolution and withdrawal

   Main articles: Russian Revolution, February Revolution, and October
   Revolution

   By the end of 1916, Russian casualties totalled nearly five million
   killed, wounded or captured, with major urban areas affected by food
   shortages and high prices. In March 1917, Tsar Nicholas ordered the
   military to forcibly suppress a wave of strikes in Petrograd but the
   troops refused to fire on the crowds.^[163] Revolutionaries set up the
   Petrograd Soviet and fearing a left-wing takeover, the State Duma
   forced Nicholas to abdicate and established the Russian Provisional
   Government, which confirmed Russia's willingness to continue the war.
   However, the Petrograd Soviet refused to disband, creating competing
   power centres and caused confusion and chaos, with frontline soldiers
   becoming increasingly demoralised and unwilling to fight on.^[164]

   Following the Tsar's abdication, Vladimir Lenin—with the help of the
   German government—was ushered by train from Switzerland into Russia on
   16 April 1917. Discontent and the weaknesses of the Provisional
   Government led to a rise in the popularity of the Bolshevik Party, led
   by Lenin, which demanded an immediate end to the war. The Revolution of
   November was followed in December by an armistice and negotiations with
   Germany. At first, the Bolsheviks refused the German terms, but when
   German troops began marching across Ukraine unopposed, the new
   government acceded to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on 3 March 1918. The
   treaty ceded vast territories, including Finland, Estonia, Latvia,
   Lithuania, parts of Poland and Ukraine to the Central Powers.^[165]

   With the Russian Empire out of the war, Romania found itself alone on
   the Eastern Front and signed the Treaty of Bucharest with the Central
   Powers in May 1918, ending the state of war between Romania and the
   Central Powers. Under the terms of the treaty, Romania had to give
   territory to Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, and lease its oil reserves
   to Germany. However, the terms also included the Central Powers
   recognition of the union of Bessarabia with Romania.^[166]^[167]

    United States enters the war

   ny%2C_2_April_1917.jpg] President Wilson asking Congress to declare war
   on Germany, 2 April 1917

   The United States was a major supplier of war materiel to the Allies
   but remained neutral in 1914, in large part due to domestic
   opposition.^[168] The most significant factor in creating the support
   Wilson needed was the German submarine offensive, which not only cost
   American lives, but paralysed trade as ships were reluctant to put to
   sea.^[169]

   On 6 April 1917, Congress declared war on Germany as an "Associated
   Power" of the Allies.^[170] The United States Navy sent a battleship
   group to Scapa Flow to join the Grand Fleet and provided convoy
   escorts. In April 1917, the United States Army had fewer than 300,000
   men, including National Guard units, compared to British and French
   armies of 4.1 and 8.3 million respectively. The Selective Service Act
   of 1917 drafted 2.8 million men, although training and equipping such
   numbers was a huge logistical challenge. By June 1918, over 667,000
   members of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF), had been
   transported to France, a figure which reached 2 million by the end of
   November.^[171]

   Despite his conviction Germany must be defeated, Wilson went to war to
   ensure the US played a leading role in shaping the peace, which meant
   preserving the AEF as a separate military force, rather than being
   absorbed into British or French units as his Allies wanted.^[172] He
   was strongly supported by AEF commander General John J. Pershing, a
   proponent of pre-1914 "open warfare" who considered the French and
   British emphasis on artillery as misguided and incompatible with
   American "offensive spirit".^[173] Much to the frustration of his
   Allies, who had suffered heavy losses in 1917, he insisted on retaining
   control of American troops and refused to commit them to the front line
   until able to operate as independent units. As a result, the first
   significant US involvement was the Meuse–Argonne offensive in late
   September 1918.^[174]

   [260px-Assaut-chemin-des-dames.jpg] French infantry advance on the
   Chemin des Dames, April 1917

   In December 1916, Robert Nivelle replaced Pétain as commander of French
   armies on the Western Front and began planning a spring attack in
   Champagne, part of a joint Franco-British operation. Nivelle claimed
   the capture of his main objective, the Chemin des Dames, would achieve
   a massive breakthrough and cost no more than 15,000 casualties.^[175]
   Poor security meant German intelligence was well informed on tactics
   and timetables, but despite this, when the attack began on 16 April the
   French made substantial gains, before being brought to a halt by the
   newly built and extremely strong defences of the Hindenburg Line.
   Nivelle persisted with frontal assaults and by 25 April the French had
   suffered nearly 135,000 casualties, including 30,000 dead, most
   incurred in the first two days.^[176]
   Files of soldiers with rifles slung follow close behind a tank, there
   is a dead body in the foreground Canadian Corps troops at the Battle of
   Vimy Ridge, 1917

   Concurrent British attacks at Arras were more successful, although
   ultimately of little strategic value.^[177] Operating as a separate
   unit for the first time, the Canadian Corps capture of Vimy Ridge
   during the battle is viewed by many Canadians as a defining moment in
   creating a sense of national identity.^[178]^[179] Although Nivelle
   continued the offensive, on 3 May the 21st Division, which had been
   involved in some of the heaviest fighting at Verdun, refused orders to
   go into battle, initiating the French Army mutinies; within days, acts
   of "collective indiscipline" had spread to 54 divisions, while over
   20,000 deserted.^[180] Unrest was almost entirely confined to the
   infantry, whose demands were largely non-political, including better

   In March and April 1917, at the First and Second Battles of Gaza,
   German and Ottoman forces stopped the advance of the Egyptian
   Expeditionary Force, which had begun in August 1916 at the Battle of
   Romani.^[182]^[183] At the end of October, the Sinai and Palestine
   campaign resumed, when General Edmund Allenby's XXth Corps, XXI Corps
   and Desert Mounted Corps won the Battle of Beersheba.^[184] Two Ottoman
   armies were defeated a few weeks later at the Battle of Mughar Ridge
   and, early in December, Jerusalem was captured following another
   Ottoman defeat at the Battle of Jerusalem.^[185]^[186]^[187] About this
   time, Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein was relieved of his
   duties as the Eighth Army's commander, replaced by Djevad Pasha, and a
   few months later the commander of the Ottoman Army in Palestine, Erich
   von Falkenhayn, was replaced by Otto Liman von Sanders.^[188]^[189]

   In early 1918, the front line was extended and the Jordan Valley was
   occupied, following the First Transjordan and the Second Transjordan
   attacks by British Empire forces in March and April 1918.^[190]

    German offensive and Allied counter-offensive (March–November 1918)

   strength fell by half.^[191]

   In December 1917, the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia,
   thus freeing large numbers of German troops for use in the west. With
   German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in, the outcome
   was to be decided on the Western Front. The Central Powers knew that
   they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for
   success based on a final quick offensive.^[192] Ludendorff drew up
   plans (codenamed Operation Michael) for the 1918 offensive on the
   Western Front. The operation commenced on 21 March 1918 with an attack
   on British forces near Saint-Quentin. German forces achieved an
   unprecedented advance of 60 kilometres (37 mi).^[193] The initial
   offensive a success; after heavy fighting, however, the offensive was
   halted. Lacking tanks or motorised artillery, the Germans were unable
   to consolidate their gains. The problems of re-supply were also
   exacerbated by increasing distances that now stretched over terrain
   that was shell-torn and often impassable to traffic.^[194]

   Following this, Germany launched Operation Georgette against the
   northern English Channel ports. The Allies halted the drive after
   limited territorial gains by Germany. The German Army to the south then
   conducted Operations Blücher and Yorck, pushing broadly towards Paris.
   Germany launched Operation Marne (Second Battle of the Marne) on 15
   July, in an attempt to encircle Reims. The resulting counter-attack,
   which started the Hundred Days Offensive on 8 August,^[195] caused a
   marked collapse in German morale.^[196]^[197]^[198]

   By September, the Germans had fallen back to the Hindenburg Line. The
   Allies had advanced to the Hindenburg Line in the north and centre.
   German forces launch numerous counterattacks, but positions and
   outposts of the Line continued to fall, with the BEF alone taking
   30,441 prisoners in the last week of September. On 24 September,
   Supreme Army Command informed the leaders in Berlin that armistice
   talks were inevitable.^[199]

   The final assault on the Hindenburg Line began with the Meuse-Argonne
   offensive, launched by American and French troops on 26 September. Two
   days later the Allied armies (Belgian French and British) attacked
   around Ypres and the day after the British Fourth and French First Army
   at St Quentin in the centre of the line. The following week,
   co-operating American and French units broke through in Champagne at
   the Battle of Blanc Mont Ridge (3 October - 27 October), forcing the
   Germans off the commanding heights, and closing towards the Belgian
   frontier.^[200] On 8 October the Hindenburg Line was pierced again by
   British and Dominion troops of the First and Third British Armies at
   the Second Battle of Cambrai.^[201]

   Allied forces started the Vardar offensive on 15 September at two key
   points: Dobro Pole and near Dojran Lake. In the Battle of Dobro Pole,
   the Serbian and French armies had success after a three day long battle
   with relatively small casualties, and subsequently made a breakthrough
   in the front, something which was rarely seen in World War I. After the
   front was broken, Allied forces started to liberate Serbia and reached
   Skopje at 29 September, after which Bulgaria signed an armistice with
   the Allies on 30 September.^[202]^[203]

   The collapse of the Central Powers came swiftly. Bulgaria was the first
   to sign an armistice, the Armistice of Salonica on 29 September
   1918.^[204] German Emperor Wilhelm II in a telegram to Bulgarian Tsar
   Ferdinand I described the situation thus: "Disgraceful! 62,000 Serbs
   decided the war!".^[205]^[206] On the same day, the German Supreme Army
   Command informed Kaiser Wilhelm II and the Imperial Chancellor Count
   Georg von Hertling, that the military situation facing Germany was
   hopeless.^[207]

   On 24 October, the Italians began a push that rapidly recovered
   territory lost after the Battle of Caporetto. This culminated in the
   Battle of Vittorio Veneto, which marked the end of the Austro-Hungarian
   Army as an effective fighting force. The offensive also triggered the
   disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During the last week of
   October, declarations of independence were made in Budapest, Prague,
   and Zagreb. On 29 October, the imperial authorities asked Italy for an
   armistice, but the Italians continued advancing, reaching Trento,
   Udine, and Trieste. On 3 November, Austria-Hungary sent a flag of truce
   to ask for an armistice (Armistice of Villa Giusti). The terms,
   arranged by telegraph with the Allied Authorities in Paris, were
   communicated to the Austrian commander and accepted. The Armistice with
   Austria was signed in the Villa Giusti, near Padua, on 3 November.
   Austria and Hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow
   of the Habsburg monarchy. In the following days, the Italian Army
   occupied Innsbruck and all Tyrol with over 20,000 soldiers.^[208]

   On 30 October, the Ottoman Empire capitulated, signing the Armistice of
   Mudros.^[204]

   With the military faltering and with widespread loss of confidence in
   the Kaiser leading to his abdication and fleeing of the country,
   Germany moved towards surrender. Prince Maximilian of Baden took charge
   of a new government on 3 October as Chancellor of Germany to negotiate
   with the Allies. Negotiations with President Wilson began immediately,
   in the hope that he would offer better terms than the British and
   French. Wilson demanded a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary
   control over the German military.^[210]

   In northern Germany, the German Revolution of 1918–1919 began at the
   end of October 1918. Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a
   last, large-scale operation in a war they believed to be as good as
   lost, initiating the uprising. The sailors' revolt, which then ensued
   in the naval ports of Wilhelmshaven and Kiel, spread across the whole
   country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on
   9 November 1918, shortly thereafter to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm
   II, and to German surrender.^[211]^[212]^[213]^[214]^[215]

Aftermath

   Main article: Aftermath of World War I

   In the aftermath of the war, four empires disappeared: the German,
   Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian.^[m] Numerous nations regained
   their former independence, and new ones were created. Four dynasties,
   together with their ancillary aristocracies, fell as a result of the
   war: the Romanovs, the Hohenzollerns, the Habsburgs, and the Ottomans.
   Belgium and Serbia were badly damaged, as was France, with 1.4 million
   soldiers dead,^[216] not counting other casualties. Germany and Russia
   were similarly affected.^[217]

  Formal end of the war

   The signing of the Treaty of Versailles in the Hall of Mirrors,

   A formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven
   months, until the signing of the Treaty of Versailles with Germany on
   28 June 1919. The United States Senate did not ratify the treaty
   despite public support for it,^[218]^[219] and did not formally end its
   involvement in the war until the Knox–Porter Resolution was signed on
   2 July 1921 by President Warren G. Harding.^[220] For the United
   Kingdom and the British Empire, the state of war ceased under the
   provisions of the Termination of the Present War (Definition) Act 1918
   with respect to:

          + Germany on 10 January 1920.^[221]
          + Austria on 16 July 1920.^[222]
          + Bulgaria on 9 August 1920.^[223]
          + Hungary on 26 July 1921.^[224]
          + Turkey on 6 August 1924.^[225]

   Some war memorials date the end of the war as being when the Versailles
   Treaty was signed in 1919, which was when many of the troops serving
   abroad finally returned home; by contrast, most commemorations of the
   war's end concentrate on the armistice of 11 November 1918.^[226]

  Peace treaties and national boundaries

   [280px-Map_Europe_1923-en.svg.png] Map of territorial changes in Europe
   after World War I (as of 1923)

   After the war, there grew a certain amount of academic focus on the
   causes of war and on the elements that could make peace flourish. In
   part, these led to the institutionalization of peace and conflict
   studies, security studies and International Relations (IR) in
   general.^[227] The Paris Peace Conference imposed a series of peace
   treaties on the Central Powers officially ending the war. The 1919
   Treaty of Versailles dealt with Germany and, building on Wilson's 14th
   point, brought into being the League of Nations on 28 June
   1919.^[228]^[229]

   The Central Powers had to acknowledge responsibility for "all the loss
   and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their
   nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon
   them by" their aggression. In the Treaty of Versailles, this statement
   was Article 231. This article became known as the War Guilt clause as
   the majority of Germans felt humiliated and resentful.^[230] Overall
   the Germans felt they had been unjustly dealt with by what they called
   the "diktat of Versailles". German historian Hagen Schulze said the
   Treaty placed Germany "under legal sanctions, deprived of military
   power, economically ruined, and politically humiliated."^[231] Belgian
   historian Laurence Van Ypersele emphasises the central role played by
   memory of the war and the Versailles Treaty in German politics in the
   1920s and 1930s:

     Active denial of war guilt in Germany and German resentment at both
     reparations and continued Allied occupation of the Rhineland made
     widespread revision of the meaning and memory of the war
     problematic. The legend of the "stab in the back" and the wish to
     revise the "Versailles diktat", and the belief in an international
     threat aimed at the elimination of the German nation persisted at
     the heart of German politics. Even a man of peace such as [Gustav]
     Stresemann publicly rejected German guilt. As for the Nazis, they
     waved the banners of domestic treason and international conspiracy
     in an attempt to galvanise the German nation into a spirit of
     revenge. Like a Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany sought to redirect the
     memory of the war to the benefit of its own policies.^[232]

   Meanwhile, new nations liberated from German rule viewed the treaty as
   recognition of wrongs committed against small nations by much larger
   aggressive neighbours.^[233]
   [280px-Dissolution_of_Austria-Hungary.png] Dissolution of
   Austria-Hungary after war

   Austria-Hungary was partitioned into several successor states, largely
   but not entirely along ethnic lines. Apart from Austria and Hungary,
   Czechoslovakia, Italy, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia received
   territories from the Dual Monarchy (the formerly separate and
   autonomous Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia was incorporated into
   Yugoslavia). The details were contained in the Saint-Germain-en-Laye
   and the Treaty of Trianon. As a result, Hungary lost 64% of its total
   population, decreasing from 20.9 million to 7.6 million and losing 31%
   (3.3 out of 10.7 million) of its ethnic Hungarians.^[234] According to
   the 1910 census, speakers of the Hungarian language included
   approximately 54% of the entire population of the Kingdom of Hungary.
   Within the country, numerous ethnic minorities were present: 16.1%
   Romanians, 10.5% Slovaks, 10.4% Germans, 2.5% Ruthenians, 2.5% Serbs
   and 8% others.^[235] Between 1920 and 1924, 354,000 Hungarians fled
   former Hungarian territories attached to Romania, Czechoslovakia, and
   Yugoslavia.^[236]

   The Russian Empire, which had withdrawn from the war in 1917 after the
   October Revolution, lost much of its western frontier as the newly
   independent nations of Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland
   were carved from it. Romania took control of Bessarabia in April
   1918.^[237]

  National identities

   Further information: Sykes–Picot Agreement

   After 123 years, Poland re-emerged as an independent country. The
   Kingdom of Serbia and its dynasty, as a "minor Entente nation" and the
   country with the most casualties per capita,^[238]^[239]^[240] became
   the backbone of a new multinational state, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats
   and Slovenes, later renamed Yugoslavia. Czechoslovakia, combining the
   Kingdom of Bohemia with parts of the Kingdom of Hungary, became a new
   nation. Romania would unite all Romanian-speaking people under a single
   state leading to Greater Romania.^[241]

   In the British Empire, the war unleashed new forms of nationalism. In
   Australia and New Zealand, the Battle of Gallipoli became known as
   those nations' "Baptism of Fire". It was the first major war in which
   the newly established countries fought, and it was one of the first
   times that Australian troops fought as Australians, not just subjects
   of the British Crown, and independent national identities for these
   nations took hold. Anzac Day, commemorating the Australian and New
   Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), celebrates this defining
   moment.^[242]^[243]

   In the aftermath of World War I, Greece fought against Turkish
   nationalists led by Mustafa Kemal, a war that eventually resulted in a
   massive population exchange between the two countries under the Treaty
   of Lausanne.^[244] According to various sources,^[245] several hundred
   thousand Greeks died during this period, which was tied in with the
   Greek genocide.^[246]

   Of the 60 million European military personnel who were mobilised from
   1914 to 1918, 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently
   disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured. Germany lost 15.1% of
   its active male population, Austria-Hungary lost 17.1%, and France lost
   10.5%.^[247] France mobilised 7.8 million men, of which 1.4 million
   died and 3.2 million were injured.^[248] Among the soldiers mutilated
   and surviving in the trenches, approximately 15,000 sustained horrific
   facial injuries, causing them to undergo social stigma and
   marginalisation; they were called the gueules cassées. In Germany,
   civilian deaths were 474,000 higher than in peacetime, due in large
   part to food shortages and malnutrition that weakened resistance to
   disease. These excess deaths are estimated as 271,000 in 1918, plus
   another 71,000 in the first half of 1919 when the blockade was still in
   effect.^[249] By the end of the war, starvation caused by famine had
   killed approximately 100,000 people in Lebanon.^[250] Between 5 and
   10 million people died in the Russian famine of 1921.^[251] By 1922,
   there were between 4.5 million and 7 million homeless children in
   Russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from World War I,
   the Russian Civil War, and the subsequent famine of 1920–1922.^[252]
   Numerous anti-Soviet Russians fled the country after the Revolution; by
   the 1930s, the northern Chinese city of Harbin had
   100,000 Russians.^[253]

   Diseases flourished in the chaotic wartime conditions. In 1914 alone,
   louse-borne epidemic typhus killed 200,000 in Serbia.^[254] From 1918
   to 1922, Russia had about 25 million infections and 3 million deaths
   from epidemic typhus.^[255] In 1923, 13 million Russians contracted
   malaria, a sharp increase from the pre-war years.^[256] Starting in
   early 1918, a major influenza epidemic known as Spanish flu spread
   around the world, accelerated by the movement of large number of
   soldiers, often crammed together in camps and transport ships with poor
   sanitation. Overall, the Spanish flu killed at least 17 million to
   25 million people,^[257]^[258] including an estimated 2.64 million
   Europeans and as many as 675,000 Americans.^[259] Moreover, between
   1915 and 1926, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica spread around the
   world affecting nearly five million people.^[260]^[261]

   if.jpg] French soldiers making a gas and flame attack on German
   trenches in Flanders

   The German army was the first to successfully deploy chemical weapons
   during the Second Battle of Ypres (22 April – 25 May 1915), after
   German scientists working under the direction of Fritz Haber at the
   Kaiser Wilhelm Institute developed a method to weaponize
   chlorine.^[n]^[262] The use of chemical weapons was sanctioned by the
   German High Command in an effort to force Allied soldiers out of their
   entrenched positions, complementing rather than supplanting more lethal
   conventional weapons.^[262] In time, chemical weapons were deployed by
   all major belligerents throughout the war, inflicting approximately
   1.3 million casualties, but relatively few fatalities: About 90,000 in
   total.^[262] For example, there were an estimated 186,000 British
   chemical weapons casualties during the war (80% of which were the
   result of exposure to the vesicant 'mustard gas', introduced to the
   battlefield by the Germans in July 1917, which burns the skin at any
   point of contact and inflicts more severe lung damage than chlorine or
   phosgene),^[262] and up to one-third of American casualties were caused
   by them. The Russian Army reportedly suffered roughly 500,000 chemical
   weapon casualties in World War I.^[263] The use of chemical weapons in
   warfare was in direct violation of the 1899 Hague Declaration
   Concerning Asphyxiating Gases and the 1907 Hague Convention on Land
   Warfare, which prohibited their use.^[264]^[265]

   The ethnic cleansing of the Ottoman Empire's Armenian population,
   including mass deportations and executions, during the final years of
   the Ottoman Empire is considered genocide.^[267] The Ottomans carried
   out organised and systematic massacres of the Armenian population at
   the beginning of the war and manipulated acts of Armenian resistance by
   portraying them as rebellions to justify further extermination.^[268]
   In early 1915, a number of Armenians volunteered to join the Russian
   forces and the Ottoman government used this as a pretext to issue the
   Tehcir Law (Law on Deportation), which authorised the deportation of
   Armenians from the Empire's eastern provinces to Syria between 1915 and
   1918. The Armenians were intentionally marched to death and a number
   were attacked by Ottoman brigands.^[269] While an exact number of
   deaths is unknown, the International Association of Genocide Scholars
   estimates 1.5 million.^[267]^[270] The government of Turkey has
   consistently denied the genocide, arguing that those who died were
   victims of inter-ethnic fighting, famine, or disease during World
   War I; these claims are rejected by most historians.^[271]

   Other ethnic groups were similarly attacked by the Ottoman Empire
   during this period, including Assyrians and Greeks, and some scholars
   consider those events to be part of the same policy of
   extermination.^[272]^[273]^[274] At least 250,000 Assyrian Christians,
   about half of the population, and 350,000–750,000 Anatolian and Pontic
   Greeks were killed between 1915 and 1922.^[275]

  Prisoners of war

   Main article: Prisoners of war in World War I

   [220px-1stGazaBritishPrisoners00118v.jpg] British prisoners guarded by
   Ottoman forces after the First Battle of Gaza in 1917

   About eight million soldiers surrendered and were held in POW camps
   during the war. All nations pledged to follow the Hague Conventions on
   fair treatment of prisoners of war, and the survival rate for POWs was
   generally much higher than that of combatants at the front.^[276]

   25–31% of Russian losses (as a proportion of those captured, wounded,
   or killed) were to prisoner status, for Austria-Hungary 32%, for Italy
   26%, for France 12%, for Germany 9%; for Britain 7%. Prisoners from the
   Allied armies totalled about 1.4 million (not including Russia, which
   lost 2.5–3.5 million soldiers as prisoners). From the Central Powers
   about 3.3 million soldiers became prisoners; most of them surrendered
   to Russians.^[277]

Soldiers' experiences

   Allied personnel was around 42,928,000 while Central personnel was near
   25,248,000.^[217]^[278] The British soldiers of the war were initially
   volunteers but increasingly were conscripted into service. Surviving
   veterans, returning home, often found they could discuss their
   experiences only amongst themselves. Grouping together, they formed
   "veterans' associations" or "Legions". A small number of personal
   accounts of American veterans have been collected by the Library of
   Congress Veterans History Project.^[279]

   Conscription was common in most European countries. However, it was
   controversial in English-speaking countries.^[280] It was especially
   unpopular among minority ethnic groups—especially the Irish Catholics
   in Ireland^[281] and Australia,^[282]^[283] and the French Catholics in
   Canada.^[284]^[285]

   In the United States, conscription began in 1917 and was generally well
   received, with a few pockets of opposition in isolated rural
   areas.^[286] The administration decided to rely primarily on
   conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military
   manpower after only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial
   1 million target in the first six weeks of the war.^[287]

   Macro- and micro-economic consequences devolved from the war. Families
   were altered by the departure of many men. With the death or absence of
   the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in
   unprecedented numbers. At the same time, industry needed to replace the
   lost labourers sent to war. This aided the struggle for voting rights
   for women.^[288]

   In all nations, the government's share of GDP increased, surpassing 50%
   in both Germany and France and nearly reaching that level in Britain.
   To pay for purchases in the United States, Britain cashed in its
   extensive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing
   heavily from Wall Street. President Wilson was on the verge of cutting
   off the loans in late 1916 but allowed a great increase in US
   government lending to the Allies. After 1919, the US demanded repayment
   of these loans. The repayments were, in part, funded by German
   reparations that, in turn, were supported by American loans to Germany.
   This circular system collapsed in 1931 and some loans were never
   repaid. Britain still owed the United States $4.4 billion^[o] of World
   War I debt in 1934; the last installment was finally paid in
   2015.^[289]

   Britain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war
   materials whose supply from traditional sources had become difficult.
   Geologists such as Albert Kitson were called on to find new resources
   of precious minerals in the African colonies. Kitson discovered
   important new deposits of manganese, used in munitions production, in
   the Gold Coast.^[290]

   Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles (the so-called "war guilt"
   clause) stated Germany accepted responsibility for "all the loss and
   damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their
   nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon
   them by the aggression of Germany and her allies."^[291] It was worded
   as such to lay a legal basis for reparations, and a similar clause was
   inserted in the treaties with Austria and Hungary. However, neither of
   them interpreted it as an admission of war guilt."^[292] In 1921, the
   total reparation sum was placed at 132 billion gold marks. However,
   "Allied experts knew that Germany could not pay" this sum. The total
   sum was divided into three categories, with the third being
   "deliberately designed to be chimerical" and its "primary function was
   to mislead public opinion ... into believing the "total sum was being
   maintained."^[293] Thus, 50 billion gold marks (12.5 billion dollars)
   "represented the actual Allied assessment of German capacity to pay"
   and "therefore … represented the total German reparations" figure that
   had to be paid.^[293]

   This figure could be paid in cash or in-kind (coal, timber, chemical
   dyes, etc.). In addition, some of the territory lost—via the treaty of
   Versailles—was credited towards the reparation figure as were other
   acts such as helping to restore the Library of Louvain.^[294] By 1929,
   the Great Depression arrived, causing political chaos throughout the
   world.^[295] In 1932 the payment of reparations was suspended by the
   international community, by which point Germany had paid only the
   equivalent of 20.598 billion gold marks in reparations.^[296] With the
   rise of Adolf Hitler, all bonds and loans that had been issued and
   taken out during the 1920s and early 1930s were cancelled. David
   Andelman notes "refusing to pay doesn't make an agreement null and
   void. The bonds, the agreement, still exist." Thus, following the
   Second World War, at the London Conference in 1953, Germany agreed to
   resume payment on the money borrowed. On 3 October 2010, Germany made
   the final payment on these bonds.^[p]

   The Australian prime minister, Billy Hughes, wrote to the British prime
   minister, David Lloyd George, "You have assured us that you cannot get
   better terms. I much regret it, and hope even now that some way may be
   found of securing agreement for demanding reparation commensurate with
   the tremendous sacrifices made by the British Empire and her Allies."
   Australia received £5,571,720 war reparations, but the direct cost of
   the war to Australia had been £376,993,052, and, by the mid-1930s,
   repatriation pensions, war gratuities, interest and sinking fund
   charges were £831,280,947.^[301] Of about 416,000 Australians who
   served, about 60,000 were killed and another 152,000 were
   wounded.^[217]

   The war contributed to the evolution of the wristwatch from women's
   jewellery to a practical everyday item, replacing the pocketwatch,
   which requires a free hand to operate.^[302] Trench watches were
   designed for use by the military as pocket watches were not as
   effective for combat. Military funding of advancements in radio
   contributed to the post-war popularity of the medium.^[302]

   Association

   In the Balkans, Yugoslav nationalists such as the leader, Ante Trumbić,
   strongly supported the war, desiring the freedom of Yugoslavs from
   Austria-Hungary and other foreign powers and the creation of an
   independent Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Committee, led by Trumbić, was
   formed in Paris on 30 April 1915 but shortly moved its office to
   London.^[303] In April 1918, the Rome Congress of Oppressed
   Nationalities met, including Czechoslovak, Italian, Polish,
   Transylvanian, and Yugoslav representatives who urged the Allies to
   support national self-determination for the peoples residing within
   Austria-Hungary.^[304]

   In the Middle East, Arab nationalism soared in Ottoman territories in
   response to the rise of Turkish nationalism during the war, with Arab
   nationalist leaders advocating the creation of a pan-Arab state. In
   1916, the Arab Revolt began in Ottoman-controlled territories of the
   Middle East in an effort to achieve independence.^[305]

   In East Africa, Iyasu V of Ethiopia was supporting the Dervish state
   who were at war with the British in the Somaliland campaign.^[306] Von
   Syburg, the German envoy in Addis Ababa, said, "now the time has come
   for Ethiopia to regain the coast of the Red Sea driving the Italians
   home, to restore the Empire to its ancient size." The Ethiopian Empire
   was on the verge of entering World War I on the side of the Central
   Powers before Iyasu's overthrow at the Battle of Segale due to Allied
   pressure on the Ethiopian aristocracy.^[307] Iyasu was accused of
   converting to Islam.^[308] According to Ethiopian historian Bahru
   Zewde, the evidence used to prove Iyasu's conversion was a doctored
   photo of Iyasu wearing a turban provided by the Allies.^[309] Some
   historians claim the British spy T. E. Lawrence forged the Iyasu
   photo.^[310]

   Guedecourt on 25 September 1916, merged with a Second Contingent. The
   two contingents suffered 75% casualties.

   A number of socialist parties initially supported the war when it began
   in August 1914.^[304] But European socialists split on national lines,
   with the concept of class conflict held by radical socialists such as
   Marxists and syndicalists being overborne by their patriotic support
   for the war.^[311] Once the war began, Austrian, British, French,
   German, and Russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current
   by supporting their countries' intervention in the war.^[312]

   Italian nationalism was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was
   initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions. One of
   the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of the
   war was Gabriele D'Annunzio, who promoted Italian irredentism and
   helped sway the Italian public to support intervention in the
   war.^[313] The Italian Liberal Party, under the leadership of Paolo
   Boselli, promoted intervention in the war on the side of the Allies and
   used the Dante Alighieri Society to promote Italian nationalism.^[314]
   Italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose
   it; some were militant supporters of the war, including Benito
   Mussolini and Leonida Bissolati.^[315] However, the Italian Socialist
   Party decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors were
   killed, resulting in a general strike called Red Week.^[316] The
   Italian Socialist Party purged itself of pro-war nationalist members,
   including Mussolini.^[316] Mussolini, a syndicalist who supported the
   war on grounds of irredentist claims on Italian-populated regions of
   Austria-Hungary, formed the pro-interventionist Il Popolo d'Italia and
   the Fasci Rivoluzionario d'Azione Internazionalista ("Revolutionary
   Fasci for International Action") in October 1914 that later developed
   into the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento in 1919, the origin of
   fascism.^[317] Mussolini's nationalism enabled him to raise funds from
   Ansaldo (an armaments firm) and other companies to create Il Popolo
   d'Italia to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the
   war.^[318]

    Patriotic funds

   On both sides there was large scale fundraising for soldiers' welfare,
   their dependents and for those injured. The Nail Men were a German
   example. Around the British Empire there were many patriotic funds,
   including the Royal Patriotic Fund Corporation, Canadian Patriotic
   Fund, Queensland Patriotic Fund and, by 1919, there were 983 funds in
   New Zealand.^[319] At the start of the next world war the New Zealand
   funds were reformed, having been criticised as overlapping, wasteful
   and abused,^[320] but 11 were still functioning in 2002.^[321]

  Opposition

   Main articles: Opposition to World War I and 1917 French Army mutinies

   Many countries jailed those who spoke out against the conflict. These
   included Eugene Debs in the United States and Bertrand Russell in
   Britain. In the US, the Espionage Act of 1917 and Sedition Act of 1918
   made it a federal crime to oppose military recruitment or make any
   statements deemed "disloyal". Publications at all critical of the
   government were removed from circulation by postal censors,^[322] and
   many served long prison sentences for statements of fact deemed
   unpatriotic.

   Dublin

   A number of nationalists opposed intervention, particularly within
   states that the nationalists were hostile to. Although the vast
   majority of Irish people consented to participate in the war in 1914
   and 1915, a minority of advanced Irish nationalists staunchly opposed
   taking part.^[323] The war began amid the Home Rule crisis in Ireland
   that had resurfaced in 1912, and by July 1914 there was a serious
   possibility of an outbreak of civil war in Ireland. Irish nationalists
   and Marxists attempted to pursue Irish independence, culminating in the
   Easter Rising of 1916, with Germany sending 20,000 rifles to Ireland to
   stir unrest in Britain.^[324] The UK government placed Ireland under
   martial law in response to the Easter Rising, though once the immediate
   threat of revolution had dissipated, the authorities did try to make
   concessions to nationalist feeling.^[325] However, opposition to
   involvement in the war increased in Ireland, resulting in the
   Conscription Crisis of 1918.

   Other opposition came from conscientious objectors—some socialist, some
   religious—who refused to fight. In Britain, 16,000 people asked for
   conscientious objector status.^[326] Some of them, most notably
   prominent peace activist Stephen Hobhouse, refused both military and
   alternative service.^[327] Many suffered years of prison, including
   solitary confinement and bread and water diets. Even after the war, in
   Britain many job advertisements were marked "No conscientious objectors
   need apply".^[328]

   On 1–4 May 1917, about 100,000 workers and soldiers of Petrograd, and
   after them, the workers and soldiers of other Russian cities, led by
   the Bolsheviks, demonstrated under banners reading "Down with the war!"
   and "all power to the soviets!" The mass demonstrations resulted in a
   crisis for the Russian Provisional Government.^[329] In Milan, in May
   1917, Bolshevik revolutionaries organised and engaged in rioting
   calling for an end to the war, and managed to close down factories and
   stop public transportation.^[330] The Italian army was forced to enter
   Milan with tanks and machine guns to face Bolsheviks and anarchists,
   who fought violently until 23 May when the army gained control of the
   city. Almost 50 people (including three Italian soldiers) were killed
   and over 800 people arrested.^[330]

Technology

   [220px-Sopwith_F-1_Camel.jpg] Royal Air Force Sopwith Camel. In April
   1917, the average life expectancy of a British pilot on the Western
   Front was 93 flying hours.^[331]

   World War I began as a clash of 20th-century technology and
   19th-century tactics, with the inevitably large ensuing casualties. By
   the end of 1917, however, the major armies, now numbering millions of
   men, had modernised and were making use of telephone, wireless
   communication,^[332] armoured cars, tanks (especially with the advent
   of the first prototype tank, Little Willie), and aircraft.^[333]

   Artillery also underwent a revolution. In 1914, cannons were positioned
   in the front line and fired directly at their targets. By 1917,
   indirect fire with guns (as well as mortars and even machine guns) was
   commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably,
   aircraft and the often overlooked field telephone.^[334]

   Fixed-wing aircraft were initially used for reconnaissance and ground
   attack. To shoot down enemy planes, anti-aircraft guns and fighter
   aircraft were developed. Strategic bombers were created, principally by
   the Germans and British, though the former used Zeppelins as
   well.^[335] Towards the end of the conflict, aircraft carriers were
   used for the first time, with HMS Furious launching Sopwith Camels in a
   raid to destroy the Zeppelin hangars at Tønder in 1918.^[336]

Diplomacy

   [220px-Cartoon_for_a_Telegram.jpg] 1917 political cartoon about the
   Zimmermann Telegram

   The non-military diplomatic and propaganda interactions among the
   nations were designed to build support for the cause or to undermine
   support for the enemy. For the most part, wartime diplomacy focused on
   five issues: propaganda campaigns; defining and redefining the war
   goals, which became harsher as the war went on; luring neutral nations
   (Italy, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, Romania) into the coalition by
   offering slices of enemy territory; and encouragement by the Allies of
   nationalistic minority movements inside the Central Powers, especially
   among Czechs, Poles, and Arabs. In addition, there were multiple peace
   proposals coming from neutrals, or one side or the other; none of them
   progressed very far.^[337]^[338]^[339]

   Memorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns. Close to
   battlefields, those buried in improvised burial grounds were gradually
   moved to formal graveyards under the care of organisations such as the
   Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the American Battle Monuments
   Commission, the German War Graves Commission, and Le Souvenir français.
   Many of these graveyards also have central monuments to the missing or
   unidentified dead, such as the Menin Gate Memorial to the Missing and
   the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme.^[citation needed]

   In 1915, John McCrae, a Canadian army doctor, wrote the poem In
   Flanders Fields as a salute to those who perished in the Great War.
   Published in Punch on 8 December 1915, it is still recited today,
   especially on Remembrance Day and Memorial Day.^[340]^[341]
   [220px-Pagny_le_Chateau_monument_morts_002b.jpg] A typical village war

   National World War I Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri, is a
   memorial dedicated to all Americans who served in World War I. The
   Liberty Memorial was dedicated on 1 November 1921, when the supreme
   Allied commanders spoke to a crowd of more than 100,000 people.^[342]

   The UK Government has budgeted substantial resources to the
   commemoration of the war during the period 2014 to 2018. The lead body
   is the Imperial War Museum.^[343] On 3 August 2014, French President
   François Hollande and German President Joachim Gauck together marked
   the centenary of Germany's declaration of war on France by laying the
   first stone of a memorial in Vieil Armand, known in German as
   Hartmannswillerkopf, for French and German soldiers killed in the
   war.^[344] During the Armistice centenary commemorations, French
   President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited
   the site of the signing of the Armistice of Compiègne and unveiled a
   plaque to reconciliation.^[345]

  Historiography

   Main article: Historiography of World War I

   Further information: Historiography of the causes of World War I

   ... "Strange, friend," I said, "Here is no cause to mourn."
   "None," said the other, "Save the undone years"...

   — Wilfred Owen, Strange Meeting, 1918^[346]

   The first tentative efforts to comprehend the meaning and consequences
   of modern warfare began during the initial phases of the war; this
   process continued throughout and after the end of hostilities, and is
   still underway more than a century later. Teaching World War I has
   presented special challenges. When compared with World War II, the
   First World War is often thought to be "a wrong war fought for the
   wrong reasons"; it lacks the metanarrative of good versus evil that
   characterizes retellings of the Second World War. Lacking recognizable
   heroes and villains, it is often taught thematically, invoking tropes
   like the wastefulness of war, the folly of generals and the innocence
   of soldiers. The complexity of the conflict is mostly obscured by these
   oversimplifications.^[347] George Kennan referred to the war as the
   "seminal catastrophe of the 20th century".^[348]

   Historian Heather Jones argues that the historiography has been
   reinvigorated by a cultural turn in the 21st century. Scholars have
   raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation,
   radicalisation of politics, race, medical science, gender and mental
   health. Among the major subjects that historians have long debated
   regarding the war include: Why the war began; why the Allies won;
   whether generals were responsible for high casualty rates; how soldiers
   endured the poor conditions of trench warfare; and to what extent the
   civilian home front accepted and endorsed the war effort.^[349]^[350]

  Unexploded ordnance

   Further information: Zone rouge and Iron harvest

   As late as 2007, signs warning visitors to keep off certain paths at
   battlefield sites like Verdun and Somme remained in place as unexploded
   ordnance continued to pose a danger to farmers living near former
   battlegrounds. In France and Belgium locals who discover caches of
   unexploded munitions are assisted by weapons disposal units. In some
   places, plant life has still not returned to normal.^[347]
