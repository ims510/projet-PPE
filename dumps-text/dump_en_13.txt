     Childhood in the war

   07 July 2023

   The war in Ukraine has been lasting for 500 days. Five hundred days of
   fear, danger and a fight for life. Throughout this period, Ukrainian
   children have been left without homes, school, healthcare, and even
   drinking water. Shelters became their playrooms, benches in the metro
   stations replaced their beds, and instead of school bells, they have
   become accustomed to hearing air alarms. This is how hostilities
   deprive Ukrainian children of their childhood.

   The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) insists that children
   should not live in an atmosphere of constant fear and anxiety. The war
   must end so that every child can have the peaceful and happy childhood
   they deserve.

A homeless childhood

   The war in Ukraine that started on February 24 has led to a devastating
   humanitarian crisis, forcing massive migration throughout Ukraine and
   abroad. Almost two-thirds of children in Ukraine have been forced to
   leave their homes.
   Yuliia is a mother of two, and she is one of those parents who were
   forced to flee Kharkiv, while being accompanied by sounds of
   explosions. The family decided to go to Germany and spent almost a week
   on the road. During the journey, Yulia, her 1-year-old daughter, and
   9-year-old son slept on the floor of an industrial building, on a small
   bed in a kindergarten, on a wooden bench, and in the car: “but it’s
   still better than under fire,” Yuliia says.

   Nobody dreams of being a refugee. Neither had Yuliia, but she had been
   dreaming of her own apartment and of travelling with her children to
   the sea. The war crushed their plans. They only want the war to be
   over, so that they would be able to come back to Ukraine.

     “I decided to leave my home and our entire life with only one goal:
     to save my children. And to survive!” says the mother of two.

   84-year-old Valentyn has three grandchildren. Like Yuliia, he spent a
   couple of restless days trying to rescue his family. The retired man
   travelled more than 1,200 kilometers in an old car to bring his son,
   daughter-in-law, three grandchildren, and a red cocker spaniel from the
   front line to the West of Ukraine.

   The family was bent on taking this desperate road after over a month of
   hiding from bombardments in a basement in Zaporizhzhia. They were
   living without any electricity, network connection and on just a small
   amount of food. As soon as the food supplies were depleted, the family
   decided to flee. The man recalls the most horrifying days for his
   family:

     “Seeing the hungry eyes of your children is worse than death”

   Valentyn’s childhood was spent on the remainders of debris and rubble,
   a legacy of World War II, and he doesn’t want his grandchildren to have
   the same fate. “I used to play with bullets when I was a kid, and I
   don’t want my grandchildren to have the same childhood,” says the
   grandfather, holding his granddaughter in his arms.

A childhood without school and education

   UNICEF warns that the war has threatened education and thus the future
   of children in Ukraine. Around 5.3 million of them face barriers to
   education, including around 3.6 million directly affected by school
   closures. In addition, 2 out of 3 refugee children from Ukraine remain
   excluded from the national education systems of their host countries.

   As a result, children in Ukraine are at risk of losing critical years
   of education and social development. According to the Ministry of
   Education and Science, more than 2,600 schools have been damaged and
   more than 400 destroyed since the beginning of the full-scale war.

   Little Vika was in her first year of school in Avdiivka when the
   full-scale war started.

     “I loved to study in my school. But the war deprived it of me,” the
     girl says.

   She is only 8 years old, but she has already experienced war conditions
   twice: first when she was born in the middle of hostilities in the East
   of Ukraine and then again while packing her schoolbag with explosions
   in the background. She lost her home, and she has no opportunity to
   study.

   Younger children have also lost access to education as a result of the
   war. On February 24, 2022, preschool education institutions in Ukraine
   closed. Some of them resumed their work only in the fall, but the rest
   haven’t been reopened yet. 7-year-old Myroslava speaks of her dream to
   visit her first graduation, which was shattered by the war:

     “This is the dress that I wanted to wear to my kindergarten
     graduation. But it didn’t happen, because the war started”

A childhood spent in shelters

   Families with children were forced to seek shelter because of
   continuous artillery attacks and air bombardments. They were hiding in
   basements, metro stations, underground parking. Cold and dark premises
   unsuitable for living have become home to many Ukrainian children. For
   over a year now, they have been living underground, sometimes without
   access to hot meals, medicine, or education. Many of them started
   dreaming about just seeing sunlight.

   After the outbreak of the war on February 24, the metro in Kharkiv has
   been serving as a shelter for thousands of people who were fleeing
   shelling and bombing outside. 10-year-old Sonya and her mom are among
   them. After the start of the war, they were living in the metro
   carriages for a couple of months.

     “Today, my mom and I went home to take a shower and take some stuff.
     It was terrifying.”

   Danylo was only 4 years old when the full-scale war started in
   Mariupol. The boy, his brother, and his parents spent a month in a
   basement hiding from countless bombardments, having no electricity,
   water, or hope for rescue.

     “There were other children, but I still felt bad in there.
     ​​Everything there was stony and ugly. We had a bed on the floor and
     stones. We had almost no food, nothing. My mom would share a small
     piece of cheese with me”

   Danylo recalls his life in the basement, recalling that his parents
   used to heat his food with candles. Fortunately, the family managed to
   escape from destroyed Mariupol. But the boy is still afraid of the dark
   and loud noises.

Childhood under shelling

   The war in Ukraine deprives Ukrainian children of the most precious
   part of their lives — it takes away their family members. For already
   500 days, children in Ukraine have been under enemy fire. And some of
   them have witnessed the worst — their relatives’ deaths.

     “I took a photo of my mother at the Kramatorsk railway station, and
     this picture became the last photo of her life,” reflects
     13-year-old Katia.

   Along with her sister, mother, and aunt, the girl was under the
   shelling of the Kramatorsk railway station.

   That day, the family was going to move to Vinnytsia because it was too
   dangerous to stay at their home. But her mother died under the shelling
   having not left the town. “These days, I am attending a psychologist
   and other doctors, who help me recover and get through all the awful
   things that have happened. It is still emotionally extremely difficult
   for me,” the girl admits.

   16-year-old Mykyta has survived a deadly shelling of Bakhmut. “A piece
   of shrapnel stopped a millimeter from my heart,” 16-year-old Mykyta is
   using his fingers to show the actual size of the metal shrapnel, which
   was removed from his chest by medics. About 3 centimeters of iron could
   take his life.

   But having survived the shelling in Bakhmut, he has lost his relatives
   and native home.

     “When you lose your loved one or have your house destroyed, you feel
     such a pain inside that you cannot find a word to describe it,”
     Mykyta wipes his tears away.

   The doctors say he will recover from the shelling. But his mental
   injuries are much more devastating than the physical ones.

Childhood surrounded by mines

   Since the beginning of the full-scale war, Ukrainian children have
   faced the danger of mines and other unexploded ordnance. Child
   casualties usually occur when children pick up explosive devices such
   as hand grenades and fuses, thinking they are toys. 8-year-old
   Vladyslav from Lyman is one of such children.

   He found a bullet near a burnt-out tank abandoned at a railroad
   crossing in Lyman and picked it up.

     “The explosion was massive. I started to bleed and couldn’t feel my
     arm. In the hospital, doctors tried to remove the shrapnel, but they
     didn’t succeed. It is still inside”

   The boy touches the scar located above his right shoulder blade.
   Recently, he can freely move his arm, and he feels no pain anymore. But
   the fear of unexploded ordnance is still gnawing at him.
   Vladyslav, 8 Vladyslav, 8 UNICEF Vladyslav, 8

   After more than 9 years of hostilities in East Ukraine and a year since
   the beginning of the full-scale war on February 24th, Ukraine is one of
   the countries most affected by mines. About 30% of the country’s
   territory is potentially contaminated with unexploded ordnance and
   mines. Mines and other explosive remnants of the war cause the deaths
   and injuries of many children in Ukraine. Furthermore, many Ukrainian
   children have to live with different physiological disabilities for the
   rest of their lives.

   UNICEF continues to respond to the urgent humanitarian needs of
   children and ensure access to medical care, immunization, nutrition,
   education, water, and sanitation and contributes to the provision of
   psychosocial and mental health support. In refugee-hosting countries,
   UNICEF continues to work with governments, municipalities and local
   partners to strengthen national systems that support refugee children
   with quality education, health services and protection.

   In Ukraine, UNICEF has expanded its efforts to support the government
   in inclusive, child-centered, and sustainable recovery by strengthening
   child protection, education, and health. Thanks to UNICEF programs,
   more than 1.8 million children have access to formal and non-formal
   education, including early learning; more than 3.4 million children and
   their caregivers have access to psychological and psychosocial support;
   more than 5.5 million people have access to clean drinking water;
   6,790,642 children and women receive primary health care in
   UNICEF-supported facilities and through UNICEF mobile teams.
