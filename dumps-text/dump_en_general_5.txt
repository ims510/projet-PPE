   The Russo-Ukrainian War^[c] is an ongoing international conflict between
   Russia and Ukraine, which began in February 2014.^[d] Following Ukraine's
   Revolution of Dignity, Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine and supported
   pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian military in the Donbas war.
   The first eight years of conflict also included naval incidents,
   cyberwarfare, and heightened political tensions. In February 2022, Russia
   launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and began occupying more of the
   country.

   In early 2014, the Euromaidan protests led to the Revolution of Dignity
   and the ousting of Ukraine's pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych.
   Shortly after, pro-Russian unrest erupted in eastern and southern Ukraine.
   Simultaneously, unmarked Russian troops moved into Ukraine's Crimea and
   took over government buildings, strategic sites and infrastructure. Russia
   soon annexed Crimea after a highly disputed referendum. In April 2014,
   Russian-backed separatist forces seized government buildings in Ukraine's
   eastern Donbas region and proclaimed the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR)
   and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) as independent states, starting
   the Donbas war. The separatists received considerable but covert support
   from Russia, and Ukrainian attempts to fully retake separatist-held areas
   failed. Although Russia denied involvement, Russian troops took part in
   the fighting. In February 2015, Russia and Ukraine signed the Minsk II
   agreements to end the conflict, but they were never fully implemented in
   the years that followed. The Donbas war settled into a violent but static
   conflict between Ukraine and the Russian and separatist forces, with many
   brief ceasefires but no lasting peace and few changes in territorial
   control.

   Beginning in 2021, Russia built up a large military presence near its
   border with Ukraine, including within neighbouring Belarus. Russian
   officials repeatedly denied plans to attack Ukraine. Russian president
   Vladimir Putin criticized the enlargement of NATO and demanded that
   Ukraine be barred from ever joining the military alliance. He also
   expressed irredentist views and questioned Ukraine's right to exist.
   Russia recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states in February 2022.
   Putin announced a "special military operation" to "demilitarize and
   denazify" Ukraine, claiming Russia had no plans to occupy the country.
   Russian forces invaded Ukraine. The invasion was internationally
   condemned; many countries imposed sanctions against Russia and increased
   existing sanctions. Russia abandoned an attempt to take Kyiv in early
   April 2022 amid fierce resistance. From August, Ukrainian forces began
   recapturing territories in the north-east and south. In late September,
   Russia declared the annexation of four partially-occupied regions of
   Ukraine, which was internationally condemned. Russia spent the winter
   conducting inconclusive offensives in the Donbas, and in spring 2023 dug
   into positions ahead of another Ukrainian counteroffensive. The war has
   resulted in a refugee crisis and tens of thousands of deaths.

  Independent Ukraine and the Orange Revolution

   Further information: Orange Revolution

   After the dissolution of the Soviet Union (USSR) in 1991, Ukraine and
   Russia maintained close ties. In 1994, Ukraine agreed to accede to the
   Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a non-nuclear-weapon
   state.^[4] Former Soviet nuclear weapons in Ukraine were removed and
   dismantled.^[5] In return, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United
   States agreed to uphold the territorial integrity and political
   independence of Ukraine through the Budapest Memorandum on Security
   Assurances.^[6]^[7] In 1999, Russia was one of the signatories of the
   Charter for European Security, which "reaffirmed the inherent right of
   each and every participating State to be free to choose or change its
   security arrangements, including treaties of alliance, as they
   evolve."^[8] In the years after the dissolution of the USSR, several
   former Eastern Bloc countries joined NATO, partly in response to regional
   security threats involving Russia such as the 1993 Russian constitutional
   crisis, the War in Abkhazia (1992–1993) and the First Chechen War
   (1994–1996). Putin claimed Western powers broke promises not to let any
   Eastern European countries join.^[9]^[10]

   [IMG]Protesters in Independence Square in Kyiv during the Orange
   Revolution, November 2004

   The 2004 Ukrainian presidential election was controversial. During the
   election campaign, opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned by
   TCDD dioxin;^[11]^[12] he later accused Russia of involvement.^[13] In
   November, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych was declared the winner,
   despite allegations of vote-rigging by election observers.^[14] During a
   two-month period which became known as the Orange Revolution, large
   peaceful protests successfully challenged the outcome. After the Supreme
   Court of Ukraine annulled the initial result due to widespread electoral
   fraud, a second round re-run was held, bringing to power Yushchenko as
   president and Yulia Tymoshenko as prime minister, and leaving Yanukovych
   in opposition.^[15] The Orange Revolution is often grouped together with
   other early-21st century protest movements, particularly within the former
   USSR, known as colour revolutions. According to Anthony Cordesman, Russian
   military officers viewed such colour revolutions as attempts by the US and
   European states to destabilise neighbouring countries and undermine
   Russia's national security.^[16] Russian President Vladimir Putin accused
   organisers of the 2011–2013 Russian protests of being former advisors to
   Yushchenko, and described the protests as an attempt to transfer the
   Orange Revolution to Russia.^[17] Rallies in favour of Putin during this
   period were called "anti-Orange protests".^[18]

   At the 2008 Bucharest summit, Ukraine and Georgia sought to join NATO. The
   response among NATO members was divided; Western European countries
   opposed offering Membership Action Plans (MAP) in order to avoid
   antagonising Russia, while US President George W. Bush pushed for their
   admission.^[19] NATO ultimately refused to offer Ukraine and Georgia MAPs,
   but also issued a statement agreeing that "these countries will become
   members of NATO" at some point. Putin voiced strong opposition to Georgia
   and Ukraine's NATO membership bids.^[20] By January 2022, the possibility
   of Ukraine joining NATO remained remote.^[21]

   In 2009, Yanukovych announced his intent to again run for president in the
   2010 Ukrainian presidential election,^[22] which he subsequently won.^[23]
   In November 2013, a wave of large, pro-European Union (EU) protests
   erupted in response to Yanukovych's sudden decision not to sign the
   EU–Ukraine Association Agreement, instead choosing closer ties to Russia
   and the Eurasian Economic Union. On 22 February 2013 the Ukrainian
   parliament had overwhelmingly approved of finalizing the agreement with
   the EU,^[24] subsequent to which Russia had put pressure on Ukraine to
   reject it using the threat of sanctions, with Kremlin adviser Sergei
   Glazyev pronouncing that if the agreement was signed Russia could not
   guarantee Ukraine's status as a state.^[25]^[26]

  Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and pro-Russian unrest

   Main articles: Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and 2014 pro-Russian
   unrest in Ukraine

   Following months of protests as part of the Euromaidan movement, on 21
   February 2014 Yanukovych and the leaders of the parliamentary opposition
   signed a settlement agreement that called for early elections. The
   following day, Yanukovych fled from the capital ahead of an impeachment
   vote that stripped him of his powers as president.^[27]^[28]^[29]^[30] On
   23 February, the Rada adopted a bill to repeal the 2012 law which gave the
   Russian language an official status.^[31] The bill was not enacted;^[32]
   however, the proposal provoked negative reactions in the Russian-speaking
   regions of Ukraine,^[33] intensified by Russian media saying that the
   ethnic Russian population was in imminent danger.^[34]

   On 27 February, an interim government was established and early
   presidential elections were scheduled. The following day, Yanukovych
   resurfaced in Russia and in a press conference declared that he remained
   the acting president of Ukraine, just as Russia was beginning its overt
   military campaign in Crimea. Leaders of Russian-speaking eastern regions
   of Ukraine declared continuing loyalty to Yanukovych,^[28]^[35] causing
   the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine.

  Russian military bases in Crimea

   Main article: Political status of Crimea

   At the onset of the conflict, Russia had roughly 12,000 military personnel
   in the Black Sea Fleet,^[34] in several locations in the Crimean peninsula
   like Sevastopol, Kacha, Hvardiiske, Simferopol Raion, Sarych, and others.
   In 2005 a dispute broke out over control of the Sarych cape lighthouse
   near Yalta, and a number of other beacons.^[36]^[37] Russian presence was
   allowed by the basing and transit agreement with Ukraine. Under the
   agreements the Russian military in Crimea was constrained to a maximum of
   25,000 troops; they were required to: respect the sovereignty of Ukraine,
   honor its legislation, not interfere in the internal affairs of the
   country, and show their "military identification cards" when crossing the
   international border.^[38] Early in the conflict, the agreement's sizeable
   troop limit allowed Russia to significantly reinforce its military
   presence under the plausible guise of security concerns, deploy special
   forces and other required capabilities to conduct the operation in
   Crimea.^[34]

   According to the original treaty on the division of the Soviet Black Sea
   Fleet signed in 1997, Russia was allowed to have its military bases in
   Crimea until 2017, after which it would evacuate all military units
   including its portion of the Black Sea Fleet out of the Autonomous
   Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol. On 21 April 2010, former Ukrainian
   president Viktor Yanukovych signed a new deal known as the Kharkiv Pact,
   to resolve the 2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute; it extended the stay to
   2042 with an option to renew.^[39]

  Legality and declaration of war

   Further information: On conducting a special military operation

   No formal declaration of war has been issued in the ongoing
   Russo-Ukrainian War. When Putin announced the 2022 Russian invasion of
   Ukraine, he claimed to commence a "special military operation",
   side-stepping a formal declaration of war.^[40] The statement was,
   however, regarded as a declaration of war by the Ukrainian government^[41]
   and reported as such by many international news sources.^[42]^[43] While
   the Ukrainian parliament refers to Russia as a "terrorist state" in regard
   to its military actions in Ukraine,^[44] it has not issued a formal
   declaration of war on its behalf.

   The Russian invasion of Ukraine violated international law (including the
   Charter of the United Nations).^[52]^[53]^[54]^[55] The invasion has also
   been called a crime of aggression under international criminal law^[56]
   and under some countries' domestic criminal codes – including those of
   Ukraine and Russia – although procedural obstacles exist to prosecutions
   under these laws.^[57]^[58]

   Forces of Ukraine during the capture of Crimea by Russia in February–March
   2014 [IMG]Russian troops blocking the Ukrainian military base in Perevalne

   On 20 February 2014, Russia began an annexation of
   Crimea.^[59]^[60]^[61]^[62] On 22 and 23 February, in the relative power
   vacuum immediately after the ousting of Yanukovych,^[63] Russian troops
   and special forces began moving into Crimea through Novorossiysk.^[61] On
   27 February, Russian forces without insignias began their advance into the
   Crimean Peninsula.^[64] They took strategic positions and captured the
   Crimean Parliament, raising a Russian flag. Security checkpoints isolated
   the Crimean Peninsula from the rest of Ukraine and restricted movement
   within the territory.^[65]^[66]^[67]^[68]

   In the following days, Russian soldiers secured key airports and a
   communications center.^[69] Russian cyberattacks shut down websites
   associated with the Ukrainian government, news media, and social media.
   Cyberattacks also enabled Russian access to the mobile phones of Ukrainian
   officials and members of parliament, further disrupting
   communications.^[70]

   On 1 March, the Russian legislature approved the use of armed forces,
   leading to an influx of Russian troops and military hardware into the
   peninsula.^[69] In the following days, all remaining Ukrainian military
   bases and installations were surrounded and besieged, including the
   Southern Naval Base. After Russia formally annexed the peninsula on 18
   March, Ukrainian military bases and ships were stormed by Russian forces.
   On 24 March, Ukraine ordered troops to withdraw; by 30 March, all
   Ukrainian forces had left the peninsula.

   On 15 April, the Ukrainian parliament declared Crimea a territory
   temporarily occupied by Russia.^[71] After the annexation, the Russian
   government increased its military presence in the region and made nuclear
   threats.^[72] Putin said that a Russian military task force would be
   established in Crimea.^[73] In November, NATO stated that it believed
   Russia was deploying nuclear-capable weapons to Crimea.^[74] Since the
   annexation of Crimea, certain NATO members have been providing training
   for the Ukrainian army.^[75]

    Pro-Russia unrest

   Main article: 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine

   From late February 2014, demonstrations by pro-Russian and anti-government
   groups took place in major cities across the eastern and southern regions
   of Ukraine.^[76] The first protests across southern and eastern Ukraine
   were largely native expressions of discontent with the new Ukrainian
   government.^[76]^[77] Russian involvement at this stage was limited to
   voicing support for the demonstrations.^[77]^[78] Russia exploited this,
   however, launching a coordinated political and military campaign against
   Ukraine.^[77]^[79] Putin gave legitimacy to the separatists when he
   described the Donbas as part of "New Russia" (Novorossiya), and expressed
   bewilderment as to how the region had ever become part of Ukraine.^[80]

   Russia continued to marshal forces near Ukraine's eastern border in late
   March, reaching 30–40,000 troops by April.^[81]^[34] The deployment was
   used to threaten escalation and disrupt Ukraine's response.^[34] This
   threat forced Ukraine to divert forces to its borders instead of the
   conflict zone.^[34]

   Ukrainian authorities cracked down on the pro-Russian protests and
   arrested local separatist leaders in early March. Those leaders were
   replaced by people with ties to the Russian security services and
   interests in Russian businesses.^[82] By April 2014, Russian citizens had
   taken control of the separatist movement, supported by volunteers and
   materiel from Russia, including Chechen and Cossack
   fighters.^[83]^[84]^[85]^[86] According to Donetsk People's Republic (DPR)
   commander Igor Girkin, without this support in April, the movement would
   have dissipated, as it had in Kharkiv and Odesa.^[87] The separatist
   groups held disputed referendums in May,^[88]^[89]^[90] which were not
   recognised by Ukraine or any other UN member state.^[88]

    Armed conflict

   [IMG]Ukrainian response to Russian activities in Donbas after seizure of
   Sloviansk on 12 April. April–May 2014.

   In April, armed conflict began in eastern Ukraine between Russian-backed
   separatist forces and Ukraine. The separatists declared the People's
   Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. From 6 April, militants occupied
   government buildings in many cities and took control of border crossings
   to Russia, transport hubs, a broadcasting center, and other strategic
   infrastructure. On 12 April several armed groups took cities of Sloviansk,
   Kramatorsk and then Horlivka, Druzhkivka in subsequent days. They were led
   by people like retired Russian colonel Igor Girkin and lieutenant colonel
   Igor Bezler. Faced with continued expansion of separatist territorial
   control, on 15 April the interim Ukrainian government launched an
   "Anti-Terrorist Operation" (ATO); however, Ukrainian forces were poorly
   prepared and ill-positioned and the operation quickly stalled.^[91]

   By the end of April, Ukraine announced it had lost control of the
   provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk. It claimed to be on "full combat alert"
   against a possible Russian invasion and reinstated conscription to its
   armed forces.^[92] Through May, the Ukrainian campaign focused on
   containing the separatists by securing key positions around the ATO zone
   to position the military for a decisive offensive once Ukraine's national
   mobilization had completed.

   As conflict between the separatists and the Ukrainian government escalated
   in May, Russia began to employ a "hybrid approach", combining
   disinformation tactics, irregular fighters, regular Russian troops, and
   conventional military support.^[93]^[94]^[95] The First Battle of Donetsk
   Airport followed the Ukrainian presidential elections. It marked a turning
   point in conflict; it was the first battle between the separatists and the
   Ukrainian government that involved large numbers of Russian
   "volunteers".^[96]^[97]^: 15  According to Ukraine, at the height of the
   conflict in the summer of 2014, Russian paramilitaries made up between 15%
   and 80% of the combatants.^[85] From June Russia trickled in arms, armor,
   and munitions.

   On 17 July 2014, Russian-controlled forces shot down a passenger aircraft,
   Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, as it was flying over eastern Ukraine.^[98]
   Investigations and the recovery of bodies began in the conflict zone as
   fighting continued.^[99]^[100]^[101]

   By the end of July, Ukrainian forces were pushing into cities, to cut off
   supply routes between the two, isolating Donetsk and attempting to restore
   control of the Russo-Ukrainian border. By 28 July, the strategic heights
   of Savur-Mohyla were under Ukrainian control, along with the town of
   Debaltseve, an important railroad hub.^[102] These operational successes
   of Ukrainian forces threatened the existence of the DPR and LPR statelets,
   prompting Russian cross-border shelling targeted at Ukrainian troops on
   their own soil, from mid-July onwards.^[103]

    August 2014 Russian invasion

   See also: Battle of Ilovaisk
   [IMG]June–August 2014 progression map

   After a series of military defeats and setbacks for the separatists, who
   united under the banner of "Novorossiya",^[104]^[105] Russia dispatched
   what it called a "humanitarian convoy" of trucks across the border in
   mid-August 2014. Ukraine called the move a "direct invasion".^[106]
   Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council reported that convoys were
   arriving almost daily in November (up to 9 convoys on 30 November) and
   that their contents were mainly arms and ammunition. Strelkov claimed that
   in early August, Russian servicemen, supposedly on "vacation" from the
   army, began to arrive in Donbas.^[107]

   By August 2014, the Ukrainian "Anti-Terrorist Operation" shrank the
   territory under pro-Russian control, and approached the border.^[108] Igor
   Girkin urged Russian military intervention, and said that the combat
   inexperience of his irregular forces, along with recruitment difficulties
   amongst the local population, had caused the setbacks. He stated, "Losing
   this war on the territory that President Vladimir Putin personally named
   New Russia would threaten the Kremlin's power and, personally, the power
   of the president".^[109]

   In response to the deteriorating situation, Russia abandoned its hybrid
   approach, and began a conventional invasion on 25 August 2014.^[108]^[110]
   On the following day, the Russian Defence Ministry said these soldiers had
   crossed the border "by accident".^[111]^[112]^[113] According to Nikolai
   Mitrokhin's estimates, by mid-August 2014 during the Battle of Ilovaisk,
   between 20,000 and 25,000 troops were fighting in the Donbas on the
   separatist side, and only 40–45% were "locals".^[114]

   On 24 August 2014, Amvrosiivka was occupied by Russian paratroopers,^[115]
   supported by 250 armoured vehicles and artillery pieces.^[116] The same
   day, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko referred to the operation as
   Ukraine's "Patriotic War of 2014" and a war against external
   aggression.^[117]^[118] On 25 August, a column of Russian military
   vehicles was reported to have crossed into Ukraine near Novoazovsk on the
   Azov sea coast. It appeared headed towards Ukrainian-held
   Mariupol,^[119]^[120]^[121]^[122]^[123] in an area that had not seen
   pro-Russian presence for weeks.^[124] Russian forces captured
   Novoazovsk.^[125] and Russian soldiers began deporting Ukrainians who did
   not have an address registered within the town.^[126] Pro-Ukrainian
   anti-war protests took place in Mariupol.^[126]^[127] The UN Security
   Council called an emergency meeting.^[128]

   [IMG]Residents of Kyiv with Sich Battalion volunteers on 26 August 2014

   The Pskov-based 76th Guards Air Assault Division allegedly entered
   Ukrainian territory in August and engaged in a skirmish near Luhansk,
   suffering 80 dead. The Ukrainian Defence Ministry said that they had
   seized two of the unit's armoured vehicles near Luhansk, and reported
   destroying another three tanks and two armoured vehicles in other
   regions.^[129]^[130] The Russian government denied the skirmish took
   place,^[130] but on 18 August, the 76th was awarded the Order of Suvorov,
   one of Russia's highest awards, by Russian minister of defence Sergey
   Shoigu for the "successful completion of military missions" and "courage
   and heroism".^[130]

   The speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament and Russian state
   television channels acknowledged that Russian soldiers entered Ukraine,
   but referred to them as "volunteers".^[131] A reporter for Novaya Gazeta,
   an opposition newspaper in Russia, stated that the Russian military
   leadership paid soldiers to resign their commissions and fight in Ukraine
   in the early summer of 2014, and then began ordering soldiers into
   Ukraine.^[132] Russian opposition MP Lev Shlosberg made similar
   statements, although he said combatants from his country are "regular
   Russian troops", disguised as units of the DPR and LPR.^[133]

   In early September 2014, Russian state-owned television channels reported
   on the funerals of Russian soldiers who had died in Ukraine, but described
   them as "volunteers" fighting for the "Russian world". Valentina
   Matviyenko, a top United Russia politician, also praised "volunteers"
   fighting in "our fraternal nation".^[131] Russian state television for the
   first time showed the funeral of a soldier killed fighting in
   Ukraine.^[134]

   On 3 September, Poroshenko said he and Putin had reached a "permanent
   ceasefire" agreement.^[135] Russia denied this, denying that it was a
   party to the conflict, adding that "they only discussed how to settle the
   conflict".^[136]^[137] Poroshenko then recanted.^[138]^[139] On 5
   September Russia's Permanent OSCE Representative Andrey Kelin, said that
   it was natural that pro-Russian separatists "are going to liberate"
   Mariupol. Ukrainian forces stated that Russian intelligence groups had
   been spotted in the area. Kelin said 'there might be volunteers over
   there.'^[140] On 4 September 2014, a NATO officer said that several
   thousand regular Russian forces wereoperating in Ukraine.^[141]

   On 5 September 2014, the Minsk Protocol ceasefire agreement drew a line of
   demarcation between Ukraine and separatist-controlled portions of Donetsk
   and Luhansk Oblasts.

   On 7 and 12 November, NATO officials reconfirmed the Russian presence,
   citing 32 tanks, 16 howitzer cannons and 30 trucks of troops entering the
   country.^[142] US general Philip M. Breedlove said "Russian tanks, Russian
   artillery, Russian air defence systems and Russian combat troops" had been
   sighted.^[74]^[143] NATO said it had seen an increase in Russian tanks,
   artillery pieces and other heavy military equipment in Ukraine and renewed
   its call for Moscow to withdraw its forces.^[144] The Chicago Council on
   Global Affairs stated that Russian separatists enjoyed technical
   advantages over the Ukrainian army since the large inflow of advanced
   military systems in mid-2014: effective anti-aircraft weapons ("Buk",
   MANPADS) suppressed Ukrainian air strikes, Russian drones provided
   intelligence, and Russian secure communications system disrupted Ukrainian
   communications intelligence. The Russian side employed electronic warfare
   systems that Ukraine lacked. Similar conclusions about the technical
   advantage of the Russian separatists were voiced by the Conflict Studies
   Research Centre.^[145] In the 12 November United Nations Security Council
   meeting, the United Kingdom's representative accused Russia of
   intentionally constraining OSCE observation missions' capabilities,
   pointing out that the observers were allowed to monitor only two
   kilometers of border, and drones deployed to extend their capabilities
   were jammed or shot down.^[146]^[non-primary source needed]

   In January 2015, Donetsk, Luhansk, and Mariupol represented the three
   battle fronts.^[148] Poroshenko described a dangerous escalation on 21
   January amid reports of more than 2,000 additional Russian troops, 200
   tanks and armed personnel carriers crossing the border. He abbreviated his
   visit to the World Economic Forum because of his concerns.^[149]

   A new package of measures to end the conflict, known as Minsk II, was
   agreed on 15 February 2015.^[150] On 18 February, Ukrainian forces
   withdrew from Debatlseve, in the last high-intensity battle of the Donbas
   war until 2022. In September 2015 the United Nations Human Rights Office
   estimated that 8000 casualties had resulted from the conflict.^[151]

   Further information: Timeline of the war in Donbas (2015), Timeline of the
   war in Donbas (2016), and Timeline of the war in Donbas (2017)

   After the Minsk agreements, the war settled into static trench warfare
   around the agreed line of contact, with few changes in territorial
   control. The conflict was marked by artillery duels, special forces
   operations, and trench warfare. Hostilities never ceased for a substantial
   period of time, but continued at a low level despite repeated attempts at
   ceasefire. In the months after the fall of Debaltseve, minor skirmishes
   continued along the line of contact, but no territorial changes occurred.
   Both sides began fortifying their position by building networks of
   trenches, bunkers and tunnels, turning the conflict into static trench
   warfare.^[152]^[153] The relatively static conflict was labelled a
   "frozen" by some,^[154] but Russia never achieved this as the fighting
   never stopped.^[155]^[156] Between 2014 and 2022 there were 29 ceasefires,
   each agreed to remain in force indefinitely. However, none of them lasted
   more than two weeks.^[157]

   US and international officials continued to report the active presence of
   Russian military in eastern Ukraine, including in the Debaltseve
   area.^[158] In 2015, Russian separatist forces were estimated to number
   around 36,000 troops (compared to 34,000 Ukrainian), of whom 8,500–10,000
   were Russian soldiers. Additionally, around 1,000 GRU troops were
   operating in the area.^[159] Another 2015 estimate held that Ukrainian
   forces outnumbered Russian forces 40,000 to 20,000.^[160] In 2017, on
   average one Ukrainian soldier died in combat every three days,^[161] with
   an estimated 6,000 Russian and 40,000 separatist troops in the
   region.^[162]^[163]

   [IMG]Casualties of the war in Donbas

   Cases of killed and wounded Russian soldiers were discussed in local
   Russian media.^[164] Recruiting for Donbas was performed openly via
   veteran and paramilitary organisations. Vladimir Yefimov, leader of one
   such organisation, explained how the process worked in the Ural area. The
   organisation recruited mostly army veterans, but also policemen,
   firefighters etc. with military experience. The cost of equipping one
   volunteer was estimated at 350,000 rubles (around $6500) plus salary of
   60,000 to 240,000 rubles per month.^[165] The recruits received weapons
   only after arriving in the conflict zone. Often, Russian troops traveled
   disguised as Red Cross personnel.^[166]^[167]^[168]^[169] Igor Trunov,
   head of the Russian Red Cross in Moscow, condemned these convoys, saying
   they complicated humanitarian aid delivery.^[170] Russia refused to allow
   OSCE to expand its mission beyond two border crossings.^[171]

   The volunteers were issued a document claiming that their participation
   was limited to "offering humanitarian help" to avoid Russian mercenary
   laws. Russia's anti-mercenary legislation defined a mercenary as someone
   who "takes part [in fighting] with aims counter to the interests of the
   Russian Federation".^[165]

   In August 2016, the Ukrainian intelligence service, the SBU, published
   telephone intercepts from 2014 of Sergey Glazyev (Russian presidential
   adviser), Konstantin Zatulin, and other people in which they discussed
   covert funding of pro-Russian activists in Eastern Ukraine, the occupation
   of administration buildings and other actions that triggered the
   conflict.^[172] As early as February 2014, Glazyev gave direct
   instructions to various pro-Russian parties on how to take over local
   administration offices, what to do afterwards, how to formulate demands,
   and promised support from Russia, including "sending our
   guys".^[173]^[174]^[175]

   Russia gained de facto control of the Kerch Strait in 2014. In 2017,
   Ukraine appealed to a court of arbitration over the use of the strait. By
   2018 Russia had built a bridge over the strait, limiting the size of ships
   that could pass through, imposed new regulations, and repeatedly detained
   Ukrainian vessels.^[176] On 25 November 2018, three Ukrainian boats
   traveling from Odesa to Mariupol were seized by Russian warships; 24
   Ukrainian sailors were detained.^[177]^[178] A day later on 26 November
   2018, the Ukrainian parliament overwhelmingly backed the imposition of
   martial law along Ukraine's coastal regions and those bordering
   Russia.^[179]

   From March to April 2021, Russia commenced a major military build-up near
   the border, followed by a second build-up between October 2021 to February
   2022 in Russia and Belarus.^[188] Throughout, the Russian government
   repeatedly denied it had plans to attack Ukraine.^[189]^[190]

   In early December 2021, following Russian denials, the US released
   intelligence of Russian invasion plans, including satellite photographs
   showing Russian troops and equipment near the border.^[191] The
   intelligence reported a Russian list of key sites and individuals to be
   killed or neutralized.^[192] The US released multiple reports that
   accurately predicted the invasion plans.^[192]

    Russian accusations and demands

   Russian irredentism
   [IMG]Ukrainian deputy prime minister Olha Stefanishyna with NATO
   secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg at a conference on 10 January 2022
   regarding a potential Russian invasion

   In the months preceding the invasion, Russian officials accused Ukraine of
   inciting tensions, Russophobia, and repressing Russian speakers. They made
   multiple security demands of Ukraine, NATO, and other EU countries. On 9
   December 2021 Putin said that "Russophobia is a first step towards
   genocide".^[193]^[194] Putin's claims were dismissed by the international
   community,^[195] and Russian claims of genocide were rejected as
   baseless.^[196]^[197]^[198] In a 21 February speech,^[199] Putin
   questioned the legitimacy of the Ukrainian state, repeating an inaccurate
   claim that "Ukraine never had a tradition of genuine statehood".^[200] He
   incorrectly stated that Vladimir Lenin had created Ukraine, by carving a
   separate Soviet Republic out of what Putin said was Russian land, and that
   Nikita Khrushchev "took Crimea away from Russia for some reason and gave
   it to Ukraine" in 1954.^[201]

   Putin falsely claimed that Ukrainian society and government were dominated
   by neo-Nazism, invoking the history of collaboration in German-occupied
   Ukraine during World War II,^[202]^[203] and echoing an antisemitic
   conspiracy theory that cast Russian Christians, rather than Jews, as the
   true victims of Nazi Germany.^[204]^[195] Ukraine does have a far-right
   fringe, including the neo-Nazi linked Azov Battalion and Right
   Sector.^[205]^[203] Analysts described Putin's rhetoric as greatly
   exaggerated.^[206]^[202] Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, stated that his
   grandfather served in the Soviet army fighting against the Nazis;^[207]
   three of his family members were killed in the Holocaust.^[206]

   [IMG]A U.S. intelligence assessment map and imagery on Russian military
   movement nearby the Ukrainian border, as on 3 December 2021. It assessed
   that Russia had deployed about 70,000 military personnel mostly about
   100–200 kilometres (62–124 mi) from the Ukrainian border, with an
   assessment this could be increased to 175,000 personnel. Published by The
   Washington Post.^[208]

   During the second build-up, Russia demanded a treaty that would forbid
   Ukraine from ever joining NATO, and end all NATO activity in its Eastern
   European member states.^[209] These demands were rejected.^[210] A treaty
   to prevent Ukraine joining NATO would go against the alliance's "open
   door" policy and the principle of self-determination, although NATO made
   no efforts to comply with Ukraine's requests to join.^[211] NATO Secretary
   General Jens Stoltenberg replied that "Russia has no say" on whether
   Ukraine joins, and that "Russia has no right to establish a sphere of
   influence to try to control their neighbors".^[212] NATO offered to
   improve communications with Russia and discuss missile placements and
   military exercises, as long as Russia withdrew troops from Ukraine's
   borders,^[213] but Russia did not withdraw.

    Prelude to full invasion

   Fighting in Donbas escalated significantly from 17 February 2022
   onwards.^[214] The Ukrainians and the pro-Russian separatists each accused
   the other of attacks.^[215]^[216] There was a sharp increase in artillery
   shelling by the Russian-led militants in Donbas, which was considered by
   Ukraine and its supporters to be an attempt to provoke the Ukrainian army
   or create a pretext for invasion.^[217]^[218]^[219] On 18 February, the
   Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics ordered mandatory emergency
   evacuations of civilians from their respective capital
   cities,^[220]^[221]^[222] although observers noted that full evacuations
   would take months.^[223] The Russian government intensified its
   disinformation campaign, with Russian state media promoting fabricated
   videos (false flags) on a nearly hourly basis purporting to show Ukrainian
   forces attacking Russia.^[224] Many of the disinformation videos were
   amateurish, and evidence showed that the claimed attacks, explosions, and
   evacuations in Donbas were staged by Russia.^[224]^[225]^[226]

   Putin's address to the nation on 21 February (English subtitles available)

   On 21 February at 22:35 (UTC+3),^[227] Putin announced that the Russian
   government would diplomatically recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk people's
   republics.^[228] The same evening, Putin directed that Russian troops
   deploy into Donbas, in what Russia referred to as a "peacekeeping
   mission".^[229]^[230] On 22 February, the Federation Council unanimously
   authorised Putin to use military force outside Russia.^[231] In response,
   Zelenskyy ordered the conscription of army reservists;^[232] The following
   day, Ukraine's parliament proclaimed a 30-day nationwide state of
   emergency and ordered the mobilisation of all
   reservists.^[233]^[234]^[235] Russia began to evacuate its embassy in
   Kyiv.^[236]

   On the night of 23 February,^[237] Zelenskyy gave a speech in Russian in
   which he appealed to the citizens of Russia to prevent war.^[238]^[239] He
   rejected Russia's claims about neo-Nazis and stated that he had no
   intention of attacking the Donbas.^[240] Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov
   said on 23 February that the separatist leaders in Donetsk and Luhansk had
   sent a letter to Putin stating that Ukrainian shelling had caused civilian
   deaths and appealing for military support.^[241]

  Full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022–present)

   For a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Russian invasion of
   Ukraine.
   [IMG]Animated map of Russia's invasion of Ukraine through 5 December 2022
   (click to play animation)

   The Russian invasion of Ukraine began on the morning of 24 February
   2022,^[242] when Putin announced a "special military operation" to
   "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine.^[243]^[244] Minutes later, missiles
   and airstrikes hit across Ukraine, including Kyiv, shortly followed by a
   large ground invasion along multiple fronts.^[245]^[246] Zelenskyy
   declared martial law and a general mobilisation of all male Ukrainian
   citizens between 18 and 60, who were banned from leaving the
   country.^[247]^[248]

   Russian attacks were initially launched on a northern front from Belarus
   towards Kyiv, a southern front from Crimea, and a south-eastern front from
   Luhansk and Donetsk and towards Kharkiv.^[249]^[250] In the northern
   front, amidst heavy losses and strong Ukrainian resistance surrounding
   Kyiv, Russia's advance stalled in March, and by April its troops
   retreated. On 8 April, Russia placed its forces in southern and eastern
   Ukraine under the command of General Aleksandr Dvornikov, and some units
   withdrawn from the north were redeployed to the Donbas.^[251] On 19 April,
   Russia launched a renewed attack across a 500 kilometres (300 mi) long
   front extending from Kharkiv to Donetsk and Luhansk.^[252] By 13 May, a
   Ukraine counter-offensive had driven back Russian forces near Kharkiv. By
   20 May, Mariupol fell to Russian troops following a prolonged siege of the
   Azovstal steel works.^[253]^[254] Russian forces continued to bomb both
   military and civilian targets far from the frontline.^[255]^[256] The war
   caused the largest refugee and humanitarian crisis within Europe since the
   Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s;^[257]^[258] the UN described it as the
   fastest-growing such crisis since World War II.^[259] In the first week of
   the invasion, the UN reported over a million refugees had fled Ukraine;
   this subsequently rose to over 7,405,590 by 24 September, a reduction from
   over eight million due to some refugees' return.^[260]^[261]

   [IMG]Ukrainian soldiers killed in the Russo-Ukrainian War in 2022

   Ukrainian forces launched counteroffensives in the south in August, and in
   the northeast in September. On 30 September, Russia annexed four oblasts
   of Ukraine which it had partially conquered during the invasion.^[262]
   This annexation was generally unrecognized and condemned by the countries
   of the world.^[263] After Putin announced that he would begin conscription
   drawn from the 300,000 citizens with military training and potentially the
   pool of about 25 million Russians who could be eligible for conscription,
   one-way tickets out of the country nearly or completely sold
   out.^[264]^[265] The Ukrainian offensive in the northeast successfully
   recaptured the majority of Kharkiv Oblast in September. In the course of
   the southern counteroffensive, Ukraine retook the city of Kherson in
   November and Russian forces withdrew to the east bank of the Dnieper
   River.^[citation needed]

   The invasion was internationally condemned as a war of
   aggression.^[266]^[267] A United Nations General Assembly resolution
   demanded a full withdrawal of Russian forces, the International Court of
   Justice ordered Russia to suspend military operations and the Council of
   Europe expelled Russia. Many countries imposed new sanctions, which
   affected the economies of Russia and the world,^[268] and provided
   humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine.^[269] In September 2022, Putin
   signed a law that would punish anyone who resists conscription with a
   10-year prison sentence^[270] resulting in an international push to allow
   asylum for Russians fleeing conscription.^[271]

   According to an estimate published by The New York Times, as of February
   2023, the "number of Russian troops killed and wounded in Ukraine is
   approaching 200,000."^[272]

Human rights violations

   See also: Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War, Humanitarian situation
   during the war in Donbas, and Russian war crimes § Ukraine

   Violations of human rights and atrocity crimes have both occurred during
   the war. From 2014 to 2021, there were more than 3,000 civilian
   casualties, with most occurring in 2014 and 2015.^[273] The right of
   movement was impeded for the inhabitants of the conflict zone.^[274]
   Arbitrary detention was practiced by both sides in the first years of the
   conflict. It decreased after 2016 in government-held areas, while in the
   separatist-held ones it continued.^[275] Investigations into the abuses
   committed by both sides made little progress.^[276]^[277]

   Since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russian
   authorities and armed forces have committed multiple war crimes in the
   form of deliberate attacks against civilian targets,^[278]^[279] massacres
   of civilians, torture and rape of women and children,^[280]^[281] and
   indiscriminate attacks in densely populated areas. After the Russian
   withdrawal from areas north of Kyiv, overwhelming evidence of war crimes
   by Russian forces was discovered. In particular, in the town of Bucha,
   evidence emerged of a massacre of civilians perpetrated by Russian troops,
   including torture, mutilation, rape, looting and deliberate killings of
   civilians.^[282]^[283]^[284] the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in
   Ukraine (OHCHR) has documented the murder of at least 73 civilians –
   mostly men, but also women and children – in Bucha.^[285] More than 1,200
   bodies of civilians were found in the Kyiv region after Russian forces
   withdrew, some of them summarily executed. There were reports of forced
   deportations of thousands of civilians, including children, to Russia,
   mainly from Russian-occupied Mariupol,^[286]^[287] as well as sexual
   violence, including cases of rape, sexual assault and gang rape,^[288] and
   deliberate killing of Ukrainian civilians by Russian forces.^[289]

   Ukrainian forces have also been accused of committing various war crimes,
   including mistreatment of detainees, though on a much smaller scale than
   Russian forces.^[290]^[291]

   [IMG]Major Russian natural gas pipelines to Europe [IMG]
     Europe TTF natural gas

   Until 2014 Ukraine was the main transit route for Russian natural gas sold
   to Europe, which earned Ukraine about US$3 billion a year in transit fees,
   making it the country's most lucrative export service.^[295] Following
   Russia's launch of the Nord Stream pipeline, which bypasses Ukraine, gas
   transit volumes steadily decreased.^[295] Following the start of the
   Russo-Ukrainian War in February 2014, severe tensions extended to the gas
   sector.^[296]^[297] The subsequent outbreak of war in the Donbas region
   forced the suspension of a project to develop Ukraine's own shale gas
   reserves at the Yuzivska gas field, which had been planned as a way to
   reduce Ukrainian dependence on Russian gas imports.^[298] Eventually, the
   EU commissioner for energy Günther Oettinger was called in to broker a
   deal securing supplies to Ukraine and transit to the EU.^[299]

   An explosion damaged a Ukrainian portion of the Urengoy–Pomary–Uzhhorod
   pipeline in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast in May 2014. Ukrainian officials blamed
   Russian terrorists.^[300] Another section of the pipeline exploded in the
   Poltava Oblast on 17 June 2014, one day after Russia limited the supply of
   gas to Ukrainian customers due to non-payment. Ukraine's Interior Minister
   Arsen Avakov said the following day that the explosion had been caused by
   a bomb.^[301]

   In 2015, Russian state media reported that Russia planned to completely
   abandon gas supplies to Europe through Ukraine after 2018.^[302]^[303]
   Russia's state-owned energy giant Gazprom had already substantially
   reduced the volumes of gas transited across Ukraine, and expressed its
   intention to reduce the level further by means of transit-diversification
   pipelines (Turkish Stream, Nord Stream, etc.).^[304] Gazprom and Ukraine
   agreed to a five-year deal on Russian gas transit to Europe at the end of
   2019.^[305]^[306]

   In 2020, the TurkStream natural gas pipeline running from Russia to Turkey
   changed the regional gas flows in South-East Europe by diverting the
   transit through Ukraine and the Trans Balkan Pipeline system.^[307]^[308]

   In May 2021, the Biden administration waived Trump's CAATSA sanctions on
   the company behind Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to
   Germany.^[309]^[310] Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said he was "surprised"
   and "disappointed" by Joe Biden's decision.^[311] In July 2021, the U.S.
   urged Ukraine not to criticise a forthcoming agreement with Germany over
   the pipeline.^[312]^[313]

   In July 2021, Biden and German Chancellor Angela Merkel concluded a deal
   that the U.S. might trigger sanctions if Russia used Nord Stream as a
   "political weapon". The deal aimed to prevent Poland and Ukraine from
   being cut off from Russian gas supplies. Ukraine will get a $50 million
   loan for green technology until 2024 and Germany will set up a billion
   dollar fund to promote Ukraine's transition to green energy to compensate
   for the loss of the gas-transit fees. The contract for transiting Russian
   gas through Ukraine will be prolonged until 2034, if the Russian
   government agrees.^[314]^[315]^[316]

   In August 2021, Zelenskyy warned that the Nord Stream 2 natural gas
   pipeline between Russia and Germany was "a dangerous weapon, not only for
   Ukraine but for the whole of Europe."^[317]^[318] In September 2021,
   Ukraine's Naftogaz CEO Yuriy Vitrenko accused Russia of using natural gas
   as a "geopolitical weapon".^[319] Vitrenko stated that "A joint statement
   from the United States and Germany said that if the Kremlin used gas as a
   weapon, there would be an appropriate response. We are now waiting for the
   imposition of sanctions on a 100% subsidiary of Gazprom, the operator of
   Nord Stream 2."^[320]

  Hybrid warfare

   The Russo-Ukrainian conflict has also included elements of hybrid warfare
   using non-traditional means. Cyberwarfare has been used by Russia in
   operations including successful attacks on the Ukrainian power grid in
   December 2015 and in December 2016, which was the first successful cyber
   attack on a power grid,^[321] and the Mass hacker supply-chain attack in
   June 2017, which the US claimed was the largest known cyber attack.^[322]
   In retaliation, Ukrainian operations have included the Surkov Leaks in
   October 2016 which released 2,337 e-mails in relation to Russian plans for
   seizing Crimea from Ukraine and fomenting separatist unrest in
   Donbas.^[323] The Russian information war against Ukraine has been another
   front of hybrid warfare waged by Russia.

   A Russian fifth column in Ukraine has also been claimed to exist among the
   Party of Regions, the Communist Party, the Progressive Socialist Party and
   the Russian Orthodox Church.^[324]^[325]^[326]

   his country's invasion of Ukraine.^[327]

   False stories have been used to provoke public outrage during the war. In
   April 2014, Russian news channels Russia-1 and NTV showed a man saying he
   was attacked by a fascist Ukrainian gang on one channel and on the other
   channel saying he was funding the training of right-wing anti-Russia
   radicals.^[328]^[329] A third segment portrayed the man as a neo-Nazi
   surgeon.^[330] In May 2014, Russia-1 aired a story about Ukrainian
   atrocities using footage of a 2012 Russian operation in North
   Caucasus.^[331] In the same month, the Russian news network Life presented
   a 2013 photograph of a wounded child in Syria as a victim of Ukrainian
   troops who had just retaken Donetsk International Airport.^[332]

   In June 2014, several Russian state news outlets reported that Ukraine was
   using white phosphorus using 2004 footage of white phosphorus being used
   by the United States in Iraq.^[331] In July 2014, Channel One Russia
   broadcast an interview with a woman who said that a 3-year-old boy who
   spoke Russian was crucified by Ukrainian nationalists in a fictitious
   square in Sloviansk that turned out to be false.^[333]^[334]^[329]^[331]

   In 2022, Russian state media told stories of genocide and mass graves full
   of ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine. One set of graves outside Luhansk
   was dug when intense fighting in 2014 cut off the electricity in the local
   morgue. Amnesty International investigated 2014 Russian claims of mass
   graves filled with hundreds of bodies and instead found isolated incidents
   of extrajudicial executions by both sides.^[335]^[336]^[337] The Russian
   censorship apparatus Roskomnadzor ordered the country's media to employ
   information only from Russian state sources or face fines and
   blocks,^[338] and ordered media and schools to describe the war as a
   "special military operation".^[339] On 4 March 2022, Putin signed into law
   a bill introducing prison sentences of up to 15 years for those who
   publish "fake news" about the Russian military and its operations,^[340]
   leading to some media outlets to stop reporting on Ukraine.^[341] Russia's
   opposition politician Alexei Navalny said the "monstrosity of lies" in the
   Russian state media "is unimaginable. And, unfortunately, so is its
   persuasiveness for those who have no access to alternative
   information."^[342] He tweeted that "warmongers" among Russian state media
   personalities "should be treated as war criminals. From the
   editors-in-chief to the talk show hosts to the news editors, [they] should
   be sanctioned now and tried someday."^[343]

   Putin and Russian media have described the government of Ukraine as being
   led by neo-Nazis persecuting ethnic Russians who are in need of protection
   by Russia, despite Ukraine's President Zelenskyy being
   Jewish.^[344]^[345]^[336] According to journalist Natalia Antonova,
   "Russia's present-day war of aggression is refashioned by propaganda into
   a direct continuation of the legacy of the millions of Russian soldiers
   who died to stop" Nazi Germany in World War II.^[346] Ukraine's rejection
   of the adoption of Russia-initiated General Assembly resolutions on
   combating the glorification of Nazism, the latest iteration of which is
   General Assembly Resolution A/C.3/76/L.57/Rev.1 on Combating Glorification
   of Nazism, Neo-Nazism and other Practices that Contribute to Fueling
   Contemporary Forms of Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and
   Related Intolerance, serve to present Ukraine as a pro-Nazi state, and
   indeed likely forms the basis for Russia's claims, with the only other
   state rejecting the adoption of the resolution being the US.^[347]^[348]
   The Deputy US Representative for ECOSOC describes such resolutions as
   "thinly veiled attempts to legitimize Russian disinformation campaigns
   denigrating neighboring nations and promoting the distorted Soviet
   narrative of much of contemporary European history, using the cynical
   guise of halting Nazi glorification".^[349]

   NAFO ('North Atlantic Fellas Organization'), a loose cadre of online
   'shitposters' vowing to fight Russian disinformation generally identified
   by cartoon Shiba Inu dogs in social media, gained notoriety after June
   2022, in the wake of a Twitter quarrel with Russian diplomat Mikhail
   Ulyanov.^[350]

  Russia–NATO relations

   Main article: Russia–NATO relations

   In his speech justifying the invasion of Ukraine, Putin falsely claimed
   that NATO military infrastructure was being built up inside Ukraine and
   was a threat to Russia.^[351] Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov
   characterized the conflict as a proxy war started by NATO.^[352] He said:
   "We don't think we're at war with NATO ... Unfortunately, NATO believes it
   is at war with Russia".^[353] NATO says it is not at war with Russia; its
   official policy is that it does not seek confrontation, but rather its
   members support Ukraine in "its right to self-defense, as enshrined in the
   UN Charter".^[354] NATO and Russia had co-operated until Russia annexed
   Crimea.^[354] Former CIA director Leon Panetta told the ABC that the U.S.
   is 'without question' involved in a proxy war with Russia.^[355]

   Russian military aircraft flying over the Baltic and Black Seas often do
   not indicate their position or communicate with air traffic controllers,
   thus posing a potential risk to civilian airliners. NATO aircraft
   scrambled many times to track and intercept these aircraft near alliance
   airspace. The Russian aircraft intercepted never entered NATO airspace,
   and the interceptions were conducted in a safe and routine manner.^[356]

   Russian Federation

    Ukrainian response

   [IMG]Following Russia's annexation of Crimea, Ukraine blocked the North
   Crimean Canal, which provided 85% of Crimea's drinking and irrigation
   water.^[357]

   Interim Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov accused Russia of
   "provoking a conflict" by backing the seizure of the Crimean parliament
   building and other government offices on the Crimean peninsula. He
   compared Russia's military actions to the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, when
   Russian troops occupied parts of the Republic of Georgia and the breakaway
   enclaves of Abkhazia and South Ossetia were established under the control
   of Russian-backed administrations. He called on Putin to withdraw Russian
   troops from Crimea and stated that Ukraine will "preserve its territory"
   and "defend its independence".^[358] On 1 March, he warned, "Military
   intervention would be the beginning of war and the end of any relations
   between Ukraine and Russia."^[359] On 1 March, Acting President Oleksandr
   Turchynov placed the Armed Forces of Ukraine on full alert and combat
   readiness.^[360]

   The Ministry of Temporarily Occupied Territories and IDPs was established
   by Ukrainian government on 20 April 2016 to manage occupied parts of
   Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea regions affected by Russian military
   intervention of 2014.^[361]

   eastern Europe that began in April 2014.

   On 4 March 2014, the United States pledged $1 billion in aid to
   Ukraine.^[362] Russia's actions increased tensions in nearby countries
   historically within its sphere of influence, particularly the Baltic and
   Moldova. All have large Russian-speaking populations, and Russian troops
   are stationed in the breakaway Moldovan territory of Transnistria.^[363]
   Some devoted resources to increasing defensive capabilities,^[364] and
   many requested increased support from the U.S. and the North Atlantic
   Treaty Organization, which they had joined in recent years.^[363]^[364]
   The conflict "reinvigorated" NATO, which had been created to face the
   Soviet Union, but had devoted more resources to "expeditionary missions"
   in recent years.^[365]

   In addition to diplomatic support in its conflict with Russia, the U.S.
   provided Ukraine with US$1.5 billion in military aid during the
   2010s.^[366] In 2018 the U.S. House of Representatives passed a provision
   blocking any training of Azov Battalion of the Ukrainian National Guard by
   American forces. In previous years, between 2014 and 2017, the U.S. House
   of Representatives passed amendments banning support of Azov, but due to
   pressure from the Pentagon, the amendments were quietly
   lifted.^[367]^[368]^[369]

   The initial reaction to the escalation of tensions in Crimea caused the
   Russian and European stock market to tumble.^[370] The intervention caused
   the Swiss franc to climb to a 2-year high against the dollar and 1-year
   high against the Euro. The Euro and the US dollar both rose, as did the
   Australian dollar.^[371] The Russian stock market declined by more than 10
   percent, while the Russian ruble hit all-time lows against the US dollar
   and the Euro.^[372]^[373]^[374] The Russian central bank hiked interest
   rates and intervened in the foreign exchange markets to the tune of
   $12 billion^[clarification needed] to try to stabilize its currency.^[371]
   Prices for wheat and grain rose, with Ukraine being a major exporter of
   both crops.^[375]

   Later in March 2014, the reaction of the financial markets to the Crimea
   annexation was surprisingly mellow, with global financial markets rising
   immediately after the referendum held in Crimea, one explanation being
   that the sanctions were already priced in following the earlier Russian
   incursion.^[376] Other observers considered that the positive reaction of
   the global financial markets on Monday 17 March 2014, after the
   announcement of sanctions against Russia by the EU and the US, revealed
   that these sanctions were too weak to hurt Russia.^[377] In early August
   2014, the German DAX was down by 6 percent for the year, and 11 percent
   since June, over concerns Russia, Germany's 13th biggest trade partner,
   would retaliate against sanctions.^[378]

   A poll of the Ukrainian public, excluding Russian-annexed Crimea, was
   taken by the International Republican Institute from 12 to 25 September
   2014.^[379] 89% of those polled opposed 2014 Russian military intervention
   in Ukraine. As broken down by region, 78% of those polled from Eastern
   Ukraine (including Dnipropetrovsk Oblast) opposed said intervention, along
   with 89% in Southern Ukraine, 93% in Central Ukraine, and 99% in Western
   Ukraine.^[379] As broken down by native language, 79% of Russian speakers
   and 95% of Ukrainian speakers opposed the intervention. 80% of those
   polled said the country should remain a unitary country.^[379]

   A poll of the Crimean public in Russian-annexed Crimea was taken by the
   Ukrainian branch of Germany's biggest market research organization, GfK,
   on 16–22 January 2015. According to its results: "Eighty-two percent of
   those polled said they fully supported Crimea's inclusion in Russia, and
   another 11 percent expressed partial support. Only 4 percent spoke out
   against it."^[380]^[381]^[382]

   A joint poll conducted by Levada and the Kyiv International Institute of
   Sociology from September to October 2020 found that in the breakaway
   regions controlled by the DPR/LPR, just over half of the respondents
   wanted to join Russia (either with or without some autonomous status)
   while less than one-tenth wanted independence and 12% wanted reintegration
   into Ukraine. It contrasted with respondents in Kyiv-controlled Donbas,
   where a vast majority felt the separatist regions should be returned to
   Ukraine.^[383] According to results from Levada in January 2022, roughly
   70% of those in the breakaway regions said their territories should become
   part of the Russian Federation.^[384]

   In March 2022, a week after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 98% of
   Ukrainians – including 82% of ethnic Russians living in Ukraine – said
   they did not believe that any part of Ukraine was rightfully part of
   Russia, according to Lord Ashcroft's polls which did not include Crimea
   and the separatist-controlled part of Donbas. 97% of Ukrainians said they
   had an unfavourable view of Russian President Vladimir Putin, with a
   further 94% saying they had an unfavourable view of the Russian Armed
   Forces.^[389]

   At the end of 2021, 75% of Ukrainians said they had a positive attitude
   toward ordinary Russians, while in May 2022, 82% of Ukrainians said they
   had a negative attitude toward ordinary Russians.^[390]

   An April 2022 survey by the Levada Centre reported that approximately 74%
   of the Russians polled supported the "special military operation" in
   Ukraine, suggesting that Russian public opinion has shifted considerably
   since 2014.^[392] According to some sources, a reason many Russians
   supported the "special military operation" has to do with the propaganda
   and disinformation.^[393]^[394] In addition, it has been suggested that
   some respondents did not want to answer pollsters' questions for fear of
   negative consequences.^[395]^[396] At the end of March, a poll conducted
   in Russia by the Levada Center concluded the following: When asked why
   they think the military operation is taking place, respondents said it was
   to protect and defend civilians, ethnic Russians or Russian speakers in
   Ukraine (43%), to prevent an attack on Russia (25%), to get rid of
   nationalists and "denazify" Ukraine (21%), and to incorporate Ukraine or
   the Donbas region into Russia (3%)."^[397] According to polls, the Russian
   President's rating rose from 71% on the eve of the invasion to 82% in
   March 2023.^[398]

    United States

   On 28 April 2022, US President Joe Biden asked Congress for an additional
   $33 billion to assist Ukraine, including $20 billion to provide weapons to
   Ukraine.^[399] On 5 May, Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced
   that Ukraine had received more than $12 billion worth of weapons and
   financial aid from Western countries since the start of Russia's invasion
   on 24 February.^[400] On 21 May 2022, the United States passed legislation
   providing $40 billion in new military and humanitarian foreign aid to
   Ukraine, marking a historically large commitment of funds.^[401]^[402] In
   August 2022, U.S. defense spending to counter the Russian war effort
   exceeded the first 5 years of war costs in Afghanistan. The Washington
   Post reported that new U.S. weapons delivered to the Ukrainian war front
   suggest a closer combat scenario with more casualties.^[403] The United
   States looks to build "enduring strength in Ukraine" with increased arms
   shipments and a record-breaking $3 billion military aid package.^[403]

    Russian military suppliers

   After expending large amounts of heavy weapons and munitions over months,
   the Russian Federation received combat drones, loitering munitions, and
   large amounts of artillery from Iran, deliveries of tanks and other
   armoured vehicles from Belarus, and reportedly planned to trade for
   artillery ammunition from North Korea and ballistic missiles from
   Iran.^[404]^[405]^[406]^[407]^[408]

   The U.S. has accused China of providing Russia with technology it needs
   for high-tech weapons, allegations which China has denied. The U.S.
   sanctioned a Chinese firm for providing satellite imagery to Russian
   mercenary forces fighting in Ukraine.^[409]

   In March 2023, Western nations had pressed the United Arab Emirates to
   halt re-exports of goods to Russia which had military uses, amidst
   allegations that the Gulf country exported 158 drones to Russia in
   2022.^[410] In May 2023, the U.S. accused South Africa of supplying arms
   to Russia in a covert naval operation,^[411] allegations which have been
   denied by South African president Cyril Ramaphosa.^[412]

    1. ^ ^a ^b The Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's
       Republic were Russian-controlled puppet states that declared their
       independence from Ukraine in May 2014. In 2022 they received
       international recognition from each other, Russia, Syria and North
       Korea, and some other partially recognised states. On 30 September
       2022 Russia declared it had formally annexed both entities.
    2. ^ There remain "some contradictions and inherent problems" regarding
       the date on which the annexation began.^[413] Ukraine claims 20
       February 2014 as "the beginning of the temporary occupation of Crimea
       and Sevastopol by Russia", citing the timeframe inscribed on the
       Russian medal "For the Return of Crimea",^[414] and in 2015 the
       Ukrainian parliament officially designated the date as such.^[415] On
       20 February 2014, Vladimir Konstantinov who at that time was a
       chairman of the republican council of Crimea and representing the
       Party of Regions expressed his thoughts about secession of the region
       from Ukraine.^[416] On 23 February 2014 the Russian ambassador to
       Ukraine Mikhail Zurabov was recalled to Moscow due to a "worsening of
       [the] situation in Ukraine". In early March 2015, President Putin
       stated in a Russian movie about the annexation of Crimea that he
       ordered the operation to "restore" Crimea to Russia following an
       all-night emergency meeting on 22–23 February 2014,^[413]^[417] and in
       2018 the Russian Foreign Minister claimed that the earlier "start
       date" on the medal was due to a "technical misunderstanding".^[418]
