  Where things stand

       Hostage deal: A hotly anticipated hostage deal between Hamas and
       Israel - which includes a four-day pause to fighting - has been left
       up in the air. Hamas had announced there'd be a four-day pause
       beginning at 10am on Thursday - but an Israeli source has since told
       the BBC there's been a setback.

       It came after a security adviser to the Israeli government said
       there'd be no Israeli hostages released by Hamas before Friday.

       Criticism of pause time: Families of those being held in Gaza have
       said every captive "needs to come home", but the UN's Palestinian
       refugee agency Unrwa said a four-day pause - in which more aid would
       be allowed to go into the enclave - is simply not enough.

       Aid crisis: Lorries carrying aid are now queuing up at the Rafah
       crossing from Egypt into Gaza in anticipation of the pause in
       hostilities. Earlier, the executive director of Unicef - the UN's
       agency for children - said Gaza now faces a crisis of "child wasting"
       - a term used to describe the most life-threatening form of
       malnutrition.

       Fighting continues: On the ground, Israel has continued its ground and
       air operation in Gaza - and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
       vowed to win "absolute victory" over Hamas. Meanwhile, Israeli defence
       minister Yoav Gallant said Israel is "slowly but surely" dismantling
       the military framework of Hamas.

       What happens now? Our colleagues on the ground are continuing to
       gather information about the hostage deal and what its potential delay
       means.

  Hezbollah says son of senior lawmaker killed in Israeli strike

       Five members of Hezbollah - the powerful Iranian-backed militia in
       Lebanon - have been killed in an Israeli strike in Beit Yahoun, south
       Lebanon, according to the Shia Islamist group.

       Abbas Raad, son of senior Hezbollah figure and Lebanese lawmaker
       Mohammad Raad was one of them, the group says.

       According to Reuters news agency, a total of 85 Hezbollah fighters
       have now been killed since violence broke out along the Israel-Lebanon
       border.

       Israel's army said it struck several Hezbollah targets in Lebanon on
       Wednesday evening, including "terror infrastructure" and "terror
       cells" that tried to launch rockets into Israel and fired at Israeli
       troops.

       Hezbollah is the largest political and military force in Lebanon. It
       is classed as a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and the Arab
       League.

  More than 50 from same family killed in Gaza, says Palestinian Authority

       As we've been reporting, the agreed pause in fighting is yet to begin
       - and Palestinian news agency Wafa has reported dozens of people
       killed in Israeli attacks on Wednesday.

       The foreign minister of the Palestinian Authority (PA), Riyad
       al-Maliki, has said 52 of those killed in the Jabalia refugee camp in
       northern Gaza on Wednesday morning belonged to the same family.

       "Only this morning, from the Qadoura family in Jabalia, 52 people have
       been wiped out completely, killed," he said during a trip to London.

       "I have the list of the names, 52 of them, they were wiped out
       completely from grandfather to grandchildren."

       The BBC has not been able to verify this independently. As a reminder,
       the PA is based in the occupied West Bank and is entirely separate to
       Hamas.

       As we reported earlier, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had
       encircled the city of Jabalia in northern Gaza. Pictures from the
       Jabalia refugee camp show badly damaged buildings.

  Who are the hostages taken by Hamas?

       Ditza Heiman

       The BBC has been tracking reports and stories of the people taken
       hostage by Hamas.

       It says it has hidden the hostages in "safe places and tunnels" within
       Gaza. Israel Defense Forces have previously said the hostages include
       children, and between 10 and 20 over-60s.

       One of those was Ditza Heiman, 84.

       She was seen by a neighbour at kibbutz Nir Oz being led away by Hamas
       gunmen, her niece said.

       A former social worker, she is the widow of Zvi Shdaimah, who came to
       the UK on the Kindertransport, the organised rescue of children from
       Nazi-controlled areas during World War Two.

  Israeli government says it believes releasing Palestinians right move to get
  hostages home

       Eylon Levy
       BBCCopyright: BBC

       A little earlier and before we got the news that the release of some
       hostages and pause in fighting will not take place before Friday, a
       spokesperson for the Israeli government spoke to our colleagues on the
       BBC News channel.

       Asked what he made of the hostage deal that's been agreed between
       Hamas and Israel, Eylon Levy described it as a "very difficult
       situation" - and said it won't be easy for Israel to let "terrorists"
       go.

       As part of the deal, which will see a four-day pause in the fighting -
       now not expected to begin before Friday - Hamas will release 50
       Israeli hostages taken during the 7 October attacks in exchange for
       150 Palestinian women and teenagers who've been held in Israeli jails.

       Levy says some of the people being released have committed "security
       offences" - including "stabbing and shooting attacks". Despite this,
       he says, the government believes this is the right move to get
       hostages being held home.

       "We have an obligation as a country to bring them home safely," Levy
       says. "We're looking forward to seeing them come home."

  A significant delay to the hostage deal

       Tom Bateman

       Middle East correspondent, in Jerusalem

       The sense had been all day in Israel that, according to the agreement,
       it would be 10:00 local time on Thursday (08:00 GMT) that a ceasefire
       would begin.

       A couple of hours after that, you'd get the release of the first batch
       of hostages held by Hamas - and then Palestinian prisoners held by
       Israel would also be freed.

       But more uncertainty appeared when Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman
       for the Israeli military, gave a briefing a few hours ago and said he
       didn’t know what time a ceasefire might start.

       We've now heard the head of Israel's National Security Council say
       that the negotiations are progressing and continuing - but hostages
       won't be released before Friday.

       That appears to be quite a significant delay - anything from 24 hours
       or even beyond - to plans that had been widely briefed and which we
       understood would be taking place tomorrow.

  Ceasefire also delayed

       Orla Guerin

       Reporting from Jerusalem

       An Israeli government source has told the BBC that the ceasefire has
       also been delayed.

  Israeli source says there are minor issues to work though

       Orla Guerin

       Reporting from Jerusalem

       This is certainly a change at the 11th hour. Israel was gearing up for
       a hostage release as early as tomorrow morning.

       There are conflicting reports here about what has caused the setback;
       some claims that Hamas has not ratified the ceasefire agreement.

       Other reports say Hamas has not provided Israel with a list of the
       hostages who were to be released on the first day. And that mechanism
       is supposed to be part of the agreement.

       An Israeli government source told me in the last half hour that they
       believed these were relatively minor issues which need to be ironed
       out, and that they would be ironed out on Thursday. That suggests that
       things would be back on track on Friday if that is the case.

       But what we can say for certain is that this is an awful blow to the
       families. They’ve been waiting almost 50 days, hoping that tomorrow
       was finally going to bring a moment of hope.

       Now once again they have to deal with uncertainty. And I think many of
       them will believe this deal is only happening when they see it.

  BreakingSenior Israeli official says no hostages will be released before
  Friday

       In the last few minutes, Tzachi Hanegbi, head of the National Security
       Council of Israel, has said Israeli hostages will not be released by
       Hamas before Friday.

       "The negotiations for the release of our hostages are advancing and
       continuing constantly," he adds in a statement released by the office
       of Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu.

       It was announced last night that Israel and Hamas had reached a deal
       to exchange 50 of the hostages held in Gaza for a four-day pause in
       fighting.

       The agreement will also see 150 Palestinian women and children held in
       Israeli jails released and an increase in humanitarian aid allowed
       into Gaza.

  UN agency says a four-day pause is not enough time

       We've been hearing from the UN's Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa
       about its hopes for the four-day pause in fighting under the
       Israel-Hamas deal.

       The agency is currently hosting close to a million people in its
       shelters, a spokeswoman has told the BBC.

       Tamara Alrifa says the agency needs to be able to go to the northern
       part of Gaza - an area that Israel has urged Gazans to leave for their
       own safety. It will be able do so during the pause in fighting "if the
       Israeli authorities give us security guarantees".

       Alrifa says Unrwa would like to send mobile clinics into shelters and
       distribute bread, flour and drinking water in the north, as it has
       been doing in the south, but four days is "definitely not enough for
       the scale and scope of the humanitarian catastrophe".

       She says the 200 trucks carrying aid that will be allowed in each of
       the four days are "very insufficient", given that around 500 trucks
       used to enter Gaza per day.

       The four fuel tankers permitted to enter under the deal will bring
       about half of what Unrwa needs to run its trucks, electricity
       generators, water pumping and desalination plants, and to provide fuel
       to hospitals and bakeries, she adds.

       Back to the situation in Gaza Strip itself now. The executive director
       of Unicef - the UN's agency for children - says the territory faces a
       crisis of "child wasting": a term used to describe the most
       life-threatening form of malnutrition.

       In an article published in the New York Times today, Catherine Russell
       said Unicef was projecting that the rate of child wasting would
       increase 30% in the next few months - and there were already more than
       7,000 cases before the events of 7 October. She added that these were
       conservative estimates, and the figure could rise as the conflict
       continued.

       Severe wasting means even catching a common cold could be life
       threatening, Russell explained.

       It's hoped that the hostage deal agreed by Israel and Hamas -
       following negotiations backed by Qatar and the US - will allow
       hundreds of lorries carrying aid to enter Gaza over four days.

       Russell says to ensure Gaza's children remain healthy and stave off
       looming health issues, humanitarian partners must be permitted to
       deliver supplies after hostilities resume.

  ICRC earlier said it wasn't notified of hostages visit

       As we just reported, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says
       humanitarian workers from the International Committee of the Red Cross
       (ICRC) will be able to visit hostages in Gaza who are not being
       released under the imminent deal between Israel and Hamas.

       Netanyahu disputed an earlier comment from the ICRC - which said the
       organisation hadn't received any information about visiting hostages
       in Gaza.

       In its statement (quoted by Israeli media) the ICRC said it had
       continuously asked for the release of all hostages and for their
       humane treatment since the brutal 7 October attack. But, it added:

         Quote Message: Thus far, the ICRC has not been made aware of any
         agreement reached by both parties related to visits by the ICRC to
         the hostages. Should visits be agreed upon, the ICRC stands ready to
         visit. The ICRC does not take part in the negotiations between the
         parties to the conflict." from International Committee of the Red
         Cross

         Thus far, the ICRC has not been made aware of any agreement reached
         by both parties related to visits by the ICRC to the hostages.
         Should visits be agreed upon, the ICRC stands ready to visit. The
         ICRC does not take part in the negotiations between the parties to
         the conflict."

         International Committee of the Red Cross

       We've approached the ICRC for comment on those latest comments from
       Netanyahu.

  BreakingNetanyahu says Red Cross can visit remaining Gaza hostages

       During that press conference, we also heard Israeli Prime Minister
       Benjamin Netanyahu say it's been agreed that humanitarian workers from
       the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) will be allowed to
       visit remaining hostages in Gaza.

       "I expect the Red Cross to do its job, and to visit them all and to
       bring them the medication that they need," he said.

  Gantz says Israel 'slowly but surely' dismantling Hamas

       We're now hearing from Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant, who says
       the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has been working very hard in the Gaza
       Strip - from land, air and sea.

       Gallant says Israel is "slowly but surely" dismantling the military
       framework of Hamas.

       The defence minister says he recommended to the Israeli parliament
       that the IDF should go further into Gaza - to show Hamas the powers of
       Israel's military and rescue hostages.

       He says that he "sincerely" hopes that the hostage release agreement
       "will be actually executed". And he hopes the results of negotiations
       will be seen in "next few days".

       Office

       Netanyahu says Israel will continue to fight Hamas in the north and in
       the south, which has only been possible "thanks to the heroism and the
       courage of our children".

       He adds: "This victory has a very heavy price to pay," and
       acknowledges that some members of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will
       die during the war.

       He says he has been told by the families of soldiers killed in combat
       to continue fighting.

  Post update

       Netanyahu says he expects some mothers and children to be released.

       "There were various things we just had to do," Netanyahu adds. He says
       in his job he sometimes has to make "extremely tough" decisions.

       He says Israel is taking advantage of every possible chance to bring
       hostages safely home.

       The PM says he was reassured during meetings yesterday that the safety
       of Israeli soldiers will be guaranteed during the "temporary truce".

       The Israeli military will then continue its campaign against Hamas, he
       says.
