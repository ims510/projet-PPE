   Ukraine: Russia’s losses mount – but self-sacrifice in war is part of the
                              country’s mythology

   A recent intelligence report published by the UK’s Ministry of Defence
   about Russia’s attempt to capture the town of Avdiivka in the Donetsk
   region is the latest illustration of just how much the conflict in Ukraine
   is becoming a war of attrition. Russia’s push to mount a new offensive in
   the east has resulted in substantive “personnel losses” for its military.

   In the west, many assume that every inch of Ukrainian land that is
   liberated brings Russia closer to military defeat and Europe to peace. But
   Russia has adapted to both internal and external shocks. As of August, it
   was estimated that Russia had suffered “as many as 120,000 deaths”. That
   number will have risen in recent weeks. And as the death toll climbs, the
   ability to replace troops becomes as important as military equipment and
   technology.

   Even though many young men left Russia rather than be sent to the front,
   the country still has a large pool of young men from which to recruit and
   has claimed to have enlisted a large number without resorting to general
   conscription – although the Kremlin’s figures have been questioned by
   other sources.

   But the question remains as to how many Russian military deaths is too
   many for Putin to retain the support of the Russian people. And it’s a
   very difficult question to answer. In Russia, the notion of military
   sacrifice plays an important role in informing national identity.

   Russia’s national story is constituted by loss. It has lived and continues
   to live a tale of self-induced suffering. Even just considering the past
   century, military losses during the second world war and in Afghanistan –
   followed by the loss of a sense of identity after the collapse of the
   Soviet empire in 1991 – have all come to define Russia’s character today.
   The sense of the “loss of empire” is what has driven Vladimir Putin’s
   foreign adventurism in Georgia and Ukraine.

For the motherland

   For the British people, the death of 179 solidiers in Iraq was traumatic
   enough for leaders to change course. But military sacrifice has a
   different meaning in Russia, one that is diametrically opposed to the
   value the liberal west places on the individual subject.

   For Russia, every dead soldier in Ukraine constitutes a step towards
   victory and reclaiming the great power image of the country’s Soviet past.
   While the west’s liberal philosophy promulgates the importance of
   individual rights, Russia is defined by a system of collectivism. Within
   its value system, the individual subject confers prestige through their
   self-sacrifice for the collective wellbeing.

   In Soviet iconography, tropes of self-sacrifice and fatal injury tend to
   be closely tied to nationalist ideas of pride and superiority. They
   pervaded propaganda posters during the “great patriotic war”.

   Kokorekin
   Russia’s notion of sacrifice: ‘For the Motherland’ (1942).

   Take the image For the Motherland! (1942) by Aleksei Kokorekin as an
   example. It conveyed Soviet resilience through the portrayal of a wounded
   soldier fighting on bravely and showing no sign of physical weakness
   despite his injuries.

   This juxtaposition between the injured self and national status is
   telling. Kokorekin’s depiction of Soviet heroism was also indicative of
   the Soviet mentality on death – where the emphasis on physical suffering
   became a source of national superiority.

Spirituality of loss

   This logic permeated the consciousness of subsequent generations and in
   how they interpreted military sacrifice. For her 1990 study Tsinkovye
   mal’chiki (translated as Zinky Boys) by Nobel prize-winning writer
   Svetlana Aleksievich, the author interviewed army veterans from the
   campaign in Afghanistan. She recalled how in one interview an artillery
   soldier described war as “a spiritual experience”, while referencing the
   self-sacrifice of the Red Army during the great patriotic war.

   This experience of spirituality through war not only reflects how Russians
   seek to replay and become part of the past, but speaks to the religious
   dimension of Russia’s discourse on self-sacrifice. This theme emerged
   strongly in comments by Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox
   Church, in September 2022, in which he was encouraging Russian men to join
   up.

     …if a person dies in the performance of this duty [war], then they have
     undoubtedly committed an act equivalent to sacrifice. They will have
     sacrificed themselves for others. And therefore, we believe that this
     sacrifice washes away all the sins that a person has committed.

   His statement rationalised the self-sacrifice of the Russian soldier on
   the basis that it served a transcendental duty – a Christ-like sacrifice –
   which would ultimately absolve them from sin. The patriarch’s comments
   speak to a particular historical tradition of religious masochism – the
   practice of self-induced physical trauma – in Russia, which dates back to
   “the early days of Christian Rus’”.

Military martyrdom

   Deciphering this internal logic governing the way many Russians deal with
   loss is imperative to the west’s understanding of the Ukraine war. Putin
   draws on a language of sacrifice which has its cultural and historical
   roots in Russian Orthodox thinking and Soviet mythology.

   This language reveals something important about Russian psychology when it
   comes to dealing with news of large-scale casualties on the battlefield. A
   soldier’s body is a potent mixture of the political and spiritual in the
   Russian psyche.

   The death of that body is for Russia a step towards achieving the fantasy
   of national prestige. For some Russians (by no means all), the trauma of
   military loss does not mean that they should stop fighting in Ukraine. On
   the contrary, it can represent a pathway to martyrdom.
