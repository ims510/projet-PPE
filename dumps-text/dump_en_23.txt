     Commission of Inquiry finds further evidence of war crimes in Ukraine

   20 October 2023 Human Rights

   A new UN report has found continued evidence of war crimes and human
   rights violations committed by Russian authorities in Ukraine, including
   torture, rape and the deportation of children. 

   The report by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on
   Ukraine, published on Friday, follows a study issued in March.

   It documents additional indiscriminate attacks with explosive weapons,
   resulting in deaths, injuries and the destruction and damage of civilian
   objects.

   For example, 24 people, mostly women and children, were killed in an
   attack on a multistorey block of residential apartments in Uman, a city in
   the Cherkasy region, in April, and part of the building became
   uninhabitable.  Commissioners spoke with residents during their recent
   visit to the country.

New evidence, same torture pattern

   Their investigations also confirmed previous findings that Russian
   authorities used torture in a widespread and systematic way in various
   types of detention facilities.

   New evidence collected in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions found
   Russian authorities used the same pattern of torture in areas under their
   control, mainly against men suspected of passing information to the
   Ukrainian authorities or supporting the Ukrainian armed forces.

   The commissioners said their interviews with victims and witnesses
   revealed “a profound disregard towards human dignity by Russian
   authorities”. Witnesses reported situations in which torture had been
   committed so brutally that the victim died.

Lasting traumatic impacts

   Recent investigations in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions showed that
   rape and other sexual violence were often committed together with
   additional acts of violence, including severe beatings, strangling,
   suffocating, slashing, shooting next to the head of the victim, and wilful
   killing.

   In one instance, a 75-year-old woman who stayed alone to protect her
   property, was raped and tortured by a Russian soldier who hit her on the
   face, chest, and ribs, and strangled her, while interrogating her.

   The soldier ordered the woman to undress and when she refused, he ripped
   off her clothes, cut her abdomen with a small sharp object and raped her
   several times. The woman also suffered several broken ribs and teeth.

   Such traumatic experiences have severe and long-term consequences for the
   physical and mental health of the victims, the report said.

Unlawful child deportations

   The Commissioners investigated further accounts of Ukrainian children
   being transferred to Russia or to Russian-occupied areas in Ukraine. They
   concluded that the transfer of 31 children to Russia in May 2022 was an
   unlawful deportation, thus a war crime.

   Their report also contains three cases where investigations showed that
   Ukrainian authorities committed violations of human rights against persons
   accused of collaboration with Russia.

   They underlined the importance of accountability “with full respect and
   care for the rights of the victims.”

   The UN Human Rights Council established the Independent Commission of
   Inquiry on Ukraine in March 2022, shortly after the start of the
   full-scale Russian invasion. The mandate was extended in April for an
   additional year.

   The three Commissioners are not UN staff and do not receive payment for
   their work.

   potential war crimes in Ukraine.
