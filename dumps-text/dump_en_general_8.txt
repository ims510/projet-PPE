            War movies are big earners. What does that say about us?

   War film is serious business. It has been from the beginning, when William
   Wellman’s Wings (1927) became the first World War I romantic drama to win
   an Oscar for best picture. One hundred years later, the supply of war
   films seems inexhaustible and their box-office attraction unbroken.

   Adjusted for inflation, Lawrence of Arabia (1962) made US$589.2 million
   and Schindler’s List (1993) US$569.5 million. Michael Bay’s Pearl Harbor
   (2001) grossed US$648.5 million. American Sniper (2015) grossed US$590.5
   million.

   The war film genre and its fascination remains.

   There we sit, watching generations get wiped out. We see terrifying
   technological inventions like the atomic bomb being dropped on Hiroshima.
   Removed from actual war in time and place, these big-screen productions
   are horrible yet spellbinding at the same time.

   War Horse (2011) is a particularly effective exploration of this
   experience and what it gives to audiences. Steven Spielberg’s film tells
   the story of a young horse and his owner forced from the idyllic fields of
   rural England into the bloody trenches of first world war France.

   War Horse illustrates the fragile balance of peace, and how sacrifice
   forms lasting bonds across borders, languages and species, echoing the
   Great War’s hard-won reconciliation process as Europeans bonded over grief
   and common trauma. Spielberg pairs moral guidance and a sense of what
   really matters in life with breathtaking landscape shots and fast-paced
   action sequences.

   But this is only one story and only one way to present war as a noble
   sacrifice to forge unity. There is no standard formula to explain why the
   experience of war continuously attracts millions of viewers. The answer is
   different for each war story, and it is different in each nation.

The national war complex

   The first Australian film to win an Academy Award was Damien Parer’s
   documentary of the fighting in New Guinea in 1942. The film garnered a
   Best Documentary Oscar for bringing the immediate experience of humanity
   at war to Australia: the wounded; the anxiety; the young soldiers’ fear of
   death far from home.

   Parer himself was killed in action in 1944 in the Palau archipelago in
   Micronesia. His cinematic legacy is a sobering documentation of
   Australians at war without flagwavers or hyper-masculine action heroes.

   Damien Parer also shot photographs while in New Guinea, including this one
   at a rest spot on the Kokoda Trail. Australian War Memorial

   SBS recently ran a week of war films in the lead-up to ANZAC Day, leading
   with Churchill (2017), which portrays the inner world of Britain’s wartime
   prime minister.

   Downfall (2004) looks at Hitler’s final days barricaded in his Berlin
   Führerbunker. Testament of Youth (2015) is a heart-swollen romance of WWI
   nurse Vera Brittain’s literary memoirs and her calls for pacifism.

   SBS’s War Week included no actual documentary footage like that of
   Parer’s.

   Today, the idea of an authentic representation of war seems less appealing
   to audiences. Marvel Studios broke box-office records all over the world
   with its fantasy battle and sci-fi war film Avengers: Endgame (2019).
   Perhaps too much reality in depicting war, the starkest of all modern
   realities, is simply unbearable. And so the re-enchantment of war comes
   with laser battles and magic gauntlets.

Fact versus fiction

   How we explore war on film has sparked heated debates.

   One argument holds the true horror of war is increasingly obscured by
   technology, Hollywood star power, and clever marketing campaigns.

   The popular HBO documentary television miniseries Band of Brothers (2001)
   and The Pacific (2010) caused controversy among military historians who
   accused the series of endorsing war nostalgia, making the audience take
   sides, and actively shaping collective modern memory through re-enacted
   combat scenes.

   War has been co-opted as an entertainment favourite in countries all
   across the world, allowing audiences to think of it as a metaphor to
   explore issues like sexism or mortality.

   One of the most popular South Korean war films, Jang Hoon’s The Front Line
   (2011), suggests the meaning of life cannot be found in senseless wars.
   The Cave (2019), a war documentary by Syrian director Feras Fayyad, shows
   how a group of female doctors in Ghouta struggle with systemic sexism
   while tending to thousands of the injured.

   Peter Jackson’s They Shall Not Grow Old (2018) drew almost unanimous
   critical acclaim.

   Jackson’s film produces a modern war experience by enhancing documentary
   footage of the first world war. We see the real faces of war: they talk,
   they smoke makeshift cigarettes, they are shellshocked victims of their
   time.

   Jackson used computerised colouration and recordings of veteran interviews
   as voiceovers. He hired forensic lip readers to superimpose dialogue on
   the previously silent combatants’ voices.

   The result is a conflicting truth about war and how its memories grow
   truer and more real before our eyes and in our ears if we want them to,
   rather than feeling safe in the fact those bombastic Hollywood scenes on
   screen can never become our reality.
