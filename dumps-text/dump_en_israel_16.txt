         Israel-Hamas truce comes into effect: How it could now unfold

   With the truce the first break in fighting after seven weeks, several
   scenarios in the war are now possible.

   The mother of the longest-serving female Palestinian prisoner in Israeli
   jails is gripped with anxiety, but for once, optimism too.

   The mother of another prisoner arrested just months after he turned 18, is
   baking chocolate cake and other pastries in anticipation of his release.

  Israel-Hamas deal: What makes a truce lead to lasting peace?

   end of list

   In Israel, a grandfather wonders whether his three-year-old granddaughter
   will be released, the toddler among six other family members held captive
   by Hamas.

   A Tel Aviv developmental psychologist, meanwhile, worries about the
   post-trauma signs in children when they return from Gaza.

   On Friday morning at 7am local time (05:00 GMT), the truce between Israel
   and Hamas came into force, marking the first break in Israel’s continuous
   seven-week bombardment of the Gaza Strip following Hamas’s October 7
   attack on southern Israel.

   The four-day pause is expected to see the exchange of 150 Palestinian
   women and children imprisoned in Israeli jails for 50 women and children
   hostages held by Hamas. It also offers an opportunity for aid to filter
   into the battered enclave where nearly 15,000 people have been killed in
   the bombing, including more than 6,000 children.

   Israeli officials, while adamant that the truce is not an end to the war,
   have also agreed to pause fighting for an additional day for every further
   10 captives freed by Hamas.

   With the truce the first breakthrough in coaxing a cessation of
   hostilities after weeks of fighting, several scenarios are possible now
   that it has come into effect.

   Here is a look at some of them:

The truce holds

   First, the truce may very well hold, the agreement respected by both
   parties.

   While the prisoners and captives are exchanged, humanitarian aid may enter
   not just southern Gaza as it has in the past few weeks, but could also
   enter northern Gaza, where Israeli forces are staging a ground assault,
   said Aboud Hamayel, a lecturer at Birzeit University in the occupied West
   Bank.

   But while humanitarian aid there will be welcomed, the truce will also
   prompt the question of what should be done with northern Gaza, as it has
   largely been emptied of Palestinians, said Sami Hamdi, the managing
   director at International Interest, a political risk firm focusing on the
   Middle East.

   “There will be increasingly loud voices demanding that these Palestinian
   families be allowed to return to northern Gaza in order to reverse the
   Israeli attempt at ethnic cleansing,” Hamdi told Al Jazeera.

   Despite this, the pause in fighting would be a lifeline for many
   Palestinians, an opportunity for them to recuperate and “take out people
   from under rubble”, Hamayel told Al Jazeera.

   In Israel, the return of captives may deliver a small public relations
   victory for embattled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has
   been facing mounting pressure from their families since their capture, the
   analyst said.

   But it was international pressure in addition to the families’ pressure
   which obliged the Israeli leader to accept the truce after weeks of
   refusing similar deals, said Hamdi.

   International pressure will therefore be critical to ensuring that both
   sides uphold the truce, agreed Hamayel, with Western actors particularly
   interested in maintaining regional stability so that the oil economy
   doesn’t become too volatile.

The truce is extended

   If international pressure succeeds, or if Hamas agrees to free more of the
   237 currently held captives, there may be the possibility that the truce
   not only sticks, but holds beyond the initial four days, for up to about
   three weeks.

   Both sides could use this longer lull in fighting to convalesce, rearrange
   their troops and gather intelligence for the next phase of the war, said
   Hamayel.

   Israel may also use the pause to scope out Hamas tunnels, which it hasn’t
   yet done, but has hinted at doing.

   Israel, while signalling it has no intention of ending the war, may also
   prefer a longer pause as the war is draining its economy and affecting its
   tourism, said Hamayel.

   Meanwhile, it may ramp up its raids in the occupied West Bank as the Gaza
   front cools, the analyst said. More than 226 people have been killed and
   more than 2,750 injured in the West Bank since October 7.

The truce breaks

   The scenario opposite the two previous ones is of the truce breaking, with
   Israel having more incentives to break it than Hamas, the analysts said.

   Hamas doesn’t want to lose credibility with its mediators, while the
   situation for Palestinian civilians is too dire for the group to risk not
   giving them a respite from fighting, said Hamayel.

   Meanwhile, Netanyahu has failed to achieve any of the strategic objectives
   that he claimed to be seeking when he began military operations, and which
   compel him to continue the fighting, said Hamdi.

   “He hasn’t been able to kill any high-profile Hamas officials. He hasn’t
   been able to wipe out Hamas in Gaza,’ Hamdi said.

   But Hamas and its regional allies would not take Israel’s breaking of the
   truce lightly, with the Palestinian armed group expected to fire missiles
   on Israel in response, and the possibility of a gradual escalation in
   tensions on multiple fronts of the war, said Hamayel.

   It is also possible that Hamas may break the truce, with such a response
   not only prompting Western ire at the group, but it would likely ramp up
   Israeli aggression from both the air and ground, he added.

   Its regional allies would still err on the side of caution, and would work
   towards pursuing a de-escalation of the conflict, said Hamdi.

A path to ending the war?

   Meanwhile, there is a concern among Israeli officials, including
   Netanyahu’s allies, that “this hostage exchange is essentially a bid to
   lure Israel into a permanent ceasefire”, said Hamdi.

   The prime minister has, as a result, been making assurances that military
   operations will continue, he added. On Thursday, Israel’s Defence Minister
   Yoav Gallant said that the war would continue for at least another two
   months after the end of the truce.

   But international pressure for a ceasefire is mounting. That was the
   majority view at a summit of the BRICS grouping earlier this week, the
   world’s most powerful bloc of emerging economies. United Nations
   Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has also called for a humanitarian
   ceasefire.

   The truce has opened up a possibility for more diplomatic engagements and
   solutions to the possible end of a bloody, bitter conflict that has
   gripped the world, said Hamayel.
