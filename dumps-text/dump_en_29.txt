   By James Waterhouse
   BBC Ukraine Correspondent

   Galina was born in Ukraine. She speaks Ukrainian, her husband is
   serving in the Ukrainian army, and she lives in a village south of the
   central Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia.

   But Galina is legally Russian. As a child, she moved there, where she
   then became a citizen.

   It means she - like thousands of other Russians in Ukraine - is now in
   a legal limbo.

   "When you show your documents, people think you're something strange,"
   she tells me in her kitchen, where she spends her time stitching
   T-shirts for wounded Ukrainian soldiers.

   Ukraine's state migration service insists that all foreigners in
   Ukraine have equal rights as each other, and no one nationality is
   discriminated against.

   But some allege this isn't the case. Lawyers working with Russians in
   Ukraine for instance told the BBC their clients face having their
   accounts frozen.

   After Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Ukraine's National Bank
   restricted financial services for all Russian and Belarusian citizens,
   although it says those with a residence permit are not affected.

   Galina disagrees. She says that because of her passport, she can't get
   a job, and fears her bank account could be blocked.

   She is seven months pregnant but because she's not legally Ukrainian,
   she can't access free state health services.

   Galina also worries she won't be able to register her child's birth:
   after she married her Ukrainian husband Maksym in a church, she says
   that officials refused to recognise the union because of her unsettled
   status.

   "They said, 'Come back when you have a passport'," explains Galina.
   "They can't understand who I am." Under Ukrainian law it's banned to
   have joint citizenship, although some do.

   because of Galina's unsettled status

   She started applying to become a Ukrainian citizen but was unable to
   complete the process because of Russia's full-scale invasion. Now
   Galina's temporary Ukrainian passport has expired, she says she feels
   like a "hostage of Russia".

   "Changing passports was difficult even before the war - now it's
   impossible," she says.

   On Povitroflotskyi Avenue in central Kyiv sits a three-storey white
   building with an overgrown garden. It's surrounded by a tall, barbed
   wire fence and the shutters are firmly down.

   They have been since 23 February last year when staff at the Russian
   Embassy evacuated for "safety reasons". A day later Moscow launched its
   full-scale invasion, and what was left of the diplomatic relations
   between Kyiv and Moscow disintegrated.

   It means thousands of people in Ukraine, like Galina, are living in
   uncertainty.

   Currently there are more than 150,000 Russians with permanent residency
   permits in Ukraine. Around 17,000 have temporary ones.

   For them to successfully apply for a Ukrainian passport or citizenship,
   they first need to physically give up their Russian citizenship. Moscow
   made that process complicated: to do so, they'd have to surrender their
   papers in either a Russian consulate abroad, or Russia itself.

   There are no guarantees Galina wouldn't be arrested in the process, or
   end up stranded outside Ukraine.

   As Galina's children arrive back from school, you can see the anguish
   in her eyes. An anxiety she attempts to hide from her children.

   But she refuses to hold Ukraine accountable, or to claim
   discrimination.

   She pins all her blame on Russia for her situation, as well as her
   Russian family members who've chosen to support their country in its
   so-called "special military operation".

   "How can I support a robber, a rapist and a murderer who breaks into my
   home?" she says.

   After Galina finishes a video call with her husband Maksym, I ask her
   what would happen to her family if he was killed on the front line.

   She puts her hand over her mouth. A thought she's tried to put to the
   back of her mind, suddenly at the forefront.

   "It's very scary," she says. "Even if he gets wounded, I wouldn't be
   able to visit him in hospital, because we're not technically married."

   "To the rest of the world we're strangers."

'I chose Ukraine'

   When Anastasia Leonova, a Russian, moved from Moscow to Kyiv in 2015,
   her friends warned her she "wouldn't be allowed to speak Russian" and
   that "there were only Nazis there".

   It was a Russian propaganda narrative which annoyed her, as she had
   uncles and cousins living in Ukraine.

   Anastasia's relocation followed her online criticism of Russia's 2014
   annexation of Crimea and backing of separatist militants, which led to
   her losing her job in Russia as well as receiving death threats.

   On 24 February last year, as Russian troops moved towards Kyiv,
   Anastasia says she only had one thought in her mind - to stay and
   fight.

   "My blood is part Ukrainian," she says. "I was born as a part of
   Ukraine."

   "I chose Ukraine as my homeland; I could not betray this choice".

   She volunteered to be a combat medic with Ukrainian forces, as they
   defended the capital against troops from her own country.

   I ask whether she's treated differently for being Russian.

   "Nobody was asking for my passport when I was working," she says with a
   smile.

   "For sure, my colleagues know."

   She admits it was initially very difficult to treat wounded Russians
   because of what they were doing.

   But later, she says, she realised that treating them was "the way to
   get our people back, the Ukrainians who were captured by the Russians".

   "Since I came here from my first day, I've been dreaming of having a
   Ukrainian passport," she says.

   "This is what I'm fighting for. Not only for freedom, but for my
   passport."

   Only a few hundred Russians have been granted Ukrainian citizenship in
   the 18 months since the full-scale invasion, down from 1,700 the year
   before.

   Unlike Galina, Anastasia feels she's closer to her dream. Serving the
   army has likely helped her cause.

   Military service, marriage to a Ukrainian and length of residency are
   all considered in citizenship applications. As the authorities point
   out, having the legal right to stay in Ukraine requires more than just
   a change in identity.

   This war has put thousands of Russians like Galina and Anastasia in a
   difficult position within Ukraine.

   The head of Ukraine's State Migration Service, Natalia Naumenko, told
   us no nationality is discriminated against when it comes to gaining
   citizenship.

   A new law is being drafted which would simplify citizenship and
   residency applications for those fighting for Ukraine.

   But Ms Naumenko points out that thanks to the full-scale invasion, the
   process certainly won't be made easier for Russians.

   "We have already simplified it for those who are fighting for Ukraine,"
   she says.

   "Why does Ukraine have to simplify it for all Russians in general?"
