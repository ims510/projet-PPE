Afternoon summary

   As it turns 6pm in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, here’s a roundup of today’s
   news so far:

     * Russia launched waves of drone attacks on Kyiv overnight, the head of
       the Ukrainian capital’s military administration said. Serhiy Popko
       said on Sunday that, according to preliminary information, Ukraine’s
       air defence systems hit about 10 Iranian-made Shahed kamikaze drones
       in Kyiv and its outskirts.

     * Ukrainian troops have pushed Russian forces ‘3km to 8km’ back from the
       banks of the Dnipro River. “Preliminary figures vary from three to
       eight kilometres, depending on the specifics, geography and landscape
       design of the left bank,” the army spokesperson Natalia Gumenyuk told
       Ukrainian television, without specifying whether Ukraine’s military
       had complete control of the area or whether the Russians had
       retreated.

     * Five people have been injured in shelling on Kherson, said the
       Ukrainian interior minister. A three-year-old girl was among those
       injured after artillery shelling, said Ihor Klymenko.

     * The pro-war Russian nationalist Igor Girkin has said he wants to run
       for president. Girkin, who is in custody awaiting trial for inciting
       extremism, said on Sunday he wanted to run even though he understood
       the March election would be a “sham” with the winner already clear.

     * Russia has said Ukraine attempted to attack Bogorodsky area, near
       Moscow, using a drone, with Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, saying
       later on Telegram that the foiled attack “did not cause any damage or
       casualties”.

     * A Ukrainian orphan taken from Mariupol after Russian forces captured
       the Ukrainian city in the first weeks of its invasion has returned
       home, Kyiv said on Sunday.

     * Vladimir Putin is reportedly going to attend the G20 virtual summit on
       Wednesday, hosted by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi.

   More on Vladimir Putin’s possible attendance at the G20 virtual summit
   after he skipped the in-person meeting in New Delhi in September.

   The Russian president did not travel to the last two G20 meetings – hosted
   by India in September and Indonesia last year, sending his foreign
   minister, Sergei Lavrov, in his place.

   In a statement on Saturday, India said its prime minister, Narendra Modi,
   would chair a virtual summit on Wednesday to “take forward key, select
   outcomes/action points from the New Delhi summit”.

   Putin has taken few trips outside Russia since the international criminal
   court issued an arrest warrant for him over the unlawful deportation of
   Ukrainian children.

Ukrainian teen taken from Mariupol returned home

   A Ukrainian orphan taken from Mariupol after Russian forces captured the
   Ukrainian city in the first weeks of its invasion has returned home, Kyiv
   said on Sunday.

   The case of Bogdan Yermokhin, who turned 18 on Sunday, made international
   headlines after Russia issued him a draft summons to report for mandatory
   military conscription before his 18th birthday.

   It was announced he would return on 10 November and today Kyiv said he had
   made it back to Ukraine after a series of negotiations involving officials
   in Moscow, Kyiv and Belarus.

   “Our team managed to bring home Bogdan Yermokhin, a Ukrainian boy who was
   taken by Russia from occupied Mariupol to the Moscow region,” said Andriy
   Yermak, the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff.

   The Kremlin has been accused of illegally transferring thousands of
   Ukrainian children to Russia, and the international criminal court has
   issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin over the alleged deportations.

   Yermokhin’s return was brokered by Qatar and the UN children’s agency,
   Unicef, said Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets in a social
   media post.

   He also published a photo of Yermokhin holding a Ukrainian flag at the
   border.

     🇺🇦Bohdan Yermokhin is in Ukraine!

     Together with other state authorities, the team of the Office of the
     Ombudsman worked out a way to return the boy within the framework of the
     implementation of the approved @bkb_ua action plan of the President of
     Ukraine @ZelenskyyUa pic.twitter.com/0wGh9fQtI4

Russia says Ukraine attempted to attack Bogorodsky area, near Moscow, using a
drone

   “An attempt by the Kyiv regime to carry out a terrorist attack using a
   drone against facilities of the Russian Federation was thwarted,” the
   Russian defence ministry said in a statement.

   Ukrainian drone attacks on Moscow were particularly frequent in the
   spring, before the launch of its counteroffensive in June, but they have
   been rare in recent weeks.

   According to the Russian ministry, the drone in question “was destroyed by
   the air defence equipment … over the territory of the Bogorodsky urban
   district, in the Moscow region”.

   Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said later on Telegram that the foiled
   attack “did not cause any damage or casualties”.

   Ukrainian authorities said two first responders were killed and at least
   seven people injured in Russian rocket strikes on the south-eastern region
   of Zaporizhzhia on Saturday.

   The attacks came as Kyiv’s air force said Russia fired 38 drones at its
   territory overnight – the highest reported number in more than six weeks.

   Ukrainian police said Russia fired a series of rocket strikes at the
   village of Komyshuvakha, close to the frontline in the Zaporizhzhia
   region, which Russia annexed last year.

   “As a result of the first two strikes, four local residents were injured
   and a fire broke out in a residential building,” they said in a statement.

   “When the police and rescuers arrived at the scene, Russians conducted
   another strike. Two emergency service workers were killed, and three more
   were injured.”

Pro-war Russian nationalist Igor Girkin says he wants to run for president

   The pro-war Russian nationalist Igor Girkin, who is in custody awaiting
   trial for inciting extremism, said on Sunday he wanted to run for
   president even though he understood the March election would be a “sham”
   with the winner already clear.

   Girkin, who is also known by the alias Igor Strelkov, has repeatedly said
   Russia faces revolution and even civil war unless Vladimir Putin’s
   military leadership fights the war in Ukraine more effectively.

   A former Federal Security Service officer who helped Russia to annex
   Crimea in 2014 and then to organise pro-Russia militias in eastern
   Ukraine, Girkin said before his arrest that he and his supporters were
   entering politics.

   “I understand perfectly well that in the current situation in Russia,
   participating in the presidential campaign is like sitting down at a table
   to play with card sharps,” Girkin said in a letter published by his
   account on Telegram.

   Girkin said he did not think he would be allowed to take part in the
   election, but hoped that his attempt to unite patriotic forces would
   disrupt the Kremlin’s plan for a “sham election” in which “the only winner
   is known in advance”.

   “This is our chance to unite in the face of external and internal
   threats,” Girkin said in the post, which was titled: “I am going to run.”

   The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said in an interview published on
   Friday that he hoped Putin would run in the March election for another
   term as president, a move that would keep Putin in power until at least
   2030.

   The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, may take part in a G20 virtual
   summit this week, the state TV presenter Pavel Zarubin said on his
   Telegram channel.

   If this happens, it would be the “first event in a long time” in which
   both Putin and western leaders have participated, Zarubin said.

   According to the RIA Novosti news agency, the summit will be held on
   Wednesday.

Ukrainian army pushes Russians ‘3km to 8km’ away from Dnipro River

   The Ukrainian army said on Sunday that it had pushed Russian forces back
   “three to eight kilometres” from the banks of the Dnipro River, which if
   confirmed would be the first meaningful advance by Kyiv’s forces months
   into a disappointing counteroffensive.

   “Preliminary figures vary from three to eight kilometres, depending on the
   specifics, geography and landscape design of the left bank,” the army
   spokesperson Natalia Gumenyuk told Ukrainian television, without
   specifying whether Ukraine’s military had complete control of the area or
   if the Russians had retreated.

   “The enemy still continues artillery fire on the right bank,” she said,
   estimating that “several tens of thousands” of Russian troops were in the
   area.

   “We have a lot of work to do,” she added.

Five people injured in shelling on Kherson, says Ukrainian interior minister

   Five people including a three-year-old girl were injured in Russian
   artillery shelling of Kherson on Sunday morning, the Ukrainian interior
   minister, Ihor Klymenko, said.

   “All of them sustained shrapnel wounds. The child and the grandmother were
   walking in the yard. Enemy artillery hit them near the entrance,” Klymenko
   said on the Telegram messaging app.

Ukrainian troops trying to push back Russian forces on east bank of Dnipro River

   And now a latest update on the fight at the Dnipro River, where Ukrainian
   troops were aiming to push back Russian forces positioned on the east
   bank, the Ukrainian military says, according to the AP.

   The wide river is a natural dividing line along the southern battlefront.
   Since withdrawing from the city of Kherson and retreating across the river
   a year ago, Moscow’s forces have regularly shelled communities on the
   Ukrainian-held side of the river to prevent Kyiv’s troops from advancing
   toward Russia-annexed Crimea.

   The Ukrainians are trying to “push back Russian army units as far as
   possible in order to make life easier for the (western) bank of the
   Kherson region, so that they get shelled less,” Natalia Humeniuk, the
   spokesperson for Ukraine’s Southern Operational Command, said.

   In response, the Russian military used “tactical aviation”, including
   Iranian-made Shahed exploding drones, to try to pin down Ukraine’s troops,
   Humeniuk said.

   The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said its troops there had
   repelled 12 attacks by the Russian army between Friday and Saturday, the
   AP reports.

Drones attacked Kyiv in waves, says head of capital's military administration

   More now on those drone attacks reported in Kyiv.

   Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, explained why
   raid alerts were announced several times in the Ukrainian capital.

   “The enemy’s UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] were launched in many groups
   and attacked Kyiv in waves, from different directions, at the same time
   constantly changing the vectors of movement along the route,” he said,
   quoted by Reuters.

   After a pause of 52 days, Moscow has resumed airstrikes on Kyiv. On
   Saturday, Ukrainian officials said all drones heading towards Kyiv were
   destroyed, but some hit infrastructure elsewhere in Ukraine.

   Popko said on Sunday that according to preliminary information Ukraine’s
   air defence systems hit about 10 Iranian-made Shahed kamikaze drones in
   Kyiv and its outskirts.

   Reuters could not independently verify the reports and there was no
   immediate comment from Russia.

Russia launches waves of drone attacks on Kyiv early on Sunday

   Hello, this is the Guardian’s live coverage of the Russian war against
   Ukraine.

   Russia launched several waves of drone attacks on Kyiv early on Sunday for
   the second night in row, stepping up its assaults on the Ukrainian capital
   after several weeks of pause, the city’s military administration said.

   There were no initial reports of “critical damage” or casualties, said
   Serhiy Popko, the head of the Kyiv’s military administration, quoted by
   Reuters.

   Here are some more developments:

     * Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has sanctioned 37 Russian
       groups and 108 people including a former prime minister and a former
       education minister and said he aimed to fight wartime abductions of
       children from Ukraine and other “Russian terror”.

     * Ukrainian officials said on Saturday that its armed forces shot down
       29 of 38 drones in an overnight raid. More than 400 towns and villages
       in the south, south-east and north of the country were affected by the
       drone attacks, including an oil refinery that was hit in Odesa.

     * Ukrainian troops are working to push back Russian forces positioned on
       the east bank of the Dnipro River, the military has said, a day after
       Ukraine claimed to have secured bridgeheads on that side of the river
       that divides the country’s partially occupied Kherson region.

     * Ukraine’s armed forces claimed to have killed a further 620 Russian
       soldiers on Friday during operations. In response, Russia has said it
       had heavily bombed Ukrainian forces near the Dnipro River and killed
       about 75 soldiers.

     * Two Ukrainian emergency workers were killed in the Zaporizhzhia region
       by Russian rocket attacks on Saturday. Ukrainian police said seven
       people were also injured when Russia fired a series of rocket strikes
       at the village of Komyshuvakha, close to the frontline in the
       Zaporizhzhia region, which Russia claimed to have annexed last year.

     * In an intelligence briefing, the UK’s Ministry of Defence noted
       Russian forces were suffering “particularly heavy casualties” in
       fighting around Avdiivka, one of three areas seeing heavy ground
       fighting. Despite the heavy fighting, the MoD said neither side was
       making significant progress.

     * Hungary must say no to the current Europe model built in Brussels, the
       prime minister, Viktor Orbán, told a congress of his Fidesz party on
       Saturday,  as his government continues to object to Ukraine joining
       the EU.

     * The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has called on the Russian
       president, Vladimir Putin, to take the first step towards a peaceful
       resolution to the conflict in Ukraine by withdrawing troops.

   president this week in Berlin.

     * More than 100 Russian doctors have signed a joint letter calling on
       Putin to release a woman jailed for a supermarket protest against the
       war in Ukraine. A St Petersburg court last week sentenced Alexandra
       Skochilenko, 33, to seven years in prison for spreading “false
       information” after she swapped supermarket price tags with slogans
