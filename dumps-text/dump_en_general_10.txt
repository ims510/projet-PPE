   Psychological warfare (PSYWAR), or the basic aspects of modern
   psychological operations (PsyOp), have been known by many other names or
   terms, including Military Information Support Operations (MISO), Psy Ops,
   political warfare, "Hearts and Minds", and propaganda.^[1] The term is
   used "to denote any action which is practiced mainly by psychological
   methods with the aim of evoking a planned psychological reaction in other
   people".^[2]

   Various techniques are used, and are aimed at influencing a target
   audience's value system, belief system, emotions, motives, reasoning, or
   behavior. It is used to induce confessions or reinforce attitudes and
   behaviors favorable to the originator's objectives, and are sometimes
   combined with black operations or false flag tactics. It is also used to
   destroy the morale of enemies through tactics that aim to depress troops'
   psychological states.^[3]^[4]

   Target audiences can be governments, organizations, groups, and
   individuals, and is not just limited to soldiers. Civilians of foreign
   territories can also be targeted by technology and media so as to cause an
   effect on the government of their country.^[5]

   Mass communication such as radio allows for direct communication with an
   enemy populace, and therefore has been used in many efforts. Social media
   channels and the internet allow for campaigns of disinformation and
   misinformation performed by agents anywhere in the world.^[6]

History[edit]

  Early[edit]

   [IMG]Mosaic of Alexander the Great on his campaign against the Persian
   Empire.

   Since prehistoric times, warlords and chiefs have recognized the
   importance of weakening the morale of their opponents. In the Battle of
   Pelusium (525 BC) between the Persian Empire and ancient Egypt, the
   Persian forces used cats and other animals as a psychological tactic
   against the Egyptians, who avoided harming cats due to religious belief
   and superstitions.

   Currying favor with supporters was the other side of psychological
   warfare, and an early practitioner of this was Alexander the Great, who
   successfully conquered large parts of Europe and the Middle East and held
   on to his territorial gains by co-opting local elites into the Greek
   administration and culture. Alexander left some of his men behind in each
   conquered city to introduce Greek culture and oppress dissident views. His
   soldiers were paid dowries to marry locals^[7] in an effort to encourage
   assimilation.

   Genghis Khan, leader of the Mongolian Empire in the 13th century AD
   employed less subtle techniques. Defeating the will of the enemy before
   having to attack and reaching a consented settlement was preferable to
   facing his wrath. The Mongol generals demanded submission to the Khan and
   threatened the initially captured villages with complete destruction if
   they refused to surrender. If they had to fight to take the settlement,
   the Mongol generals fulfilled their threats and massacred the survivors.
   Tales of the encroaching horde spread to the next villages and created an
   aura of insecurity that undermined the possibility of future
   resistance.^[8]

   Genghis Khan also employed tactics that made his numbers seem greater than
   they actually were. During night operations he ordered each soldier to
   light three torches at dusk to give the illusion of an overwhelming army
   and deceive and intimidate enemy scouts. He also sometimes had objects
   tied to the tails of his horses, so that riding on open and dry fields
   raised a cloud of dust that gave the enemy the impression of great
   numbers. His soldiers used arrows specially notched to whistle as they
   flew through the air, creating a terrifying noise.^[9]

   Another tactic favored by the Mongols was catapulting severed human heads
   over city walls to frighten the inhabitants and spread disease in the
   besieged city's closed confines. This was especially used by the
   later^[which?] Turko-Mongol chieftain.

   The Muslim caliph Omar, in his battles against the Byzantine Empire, sent
   small reinforcements in the form of a continuous stream, giving the
   impression that a large force would accumulate eventually if not swiftly
   dealt with.

   During the early Qin dynasty and late Eastern Zhou dynasty in 1st century
   AD China, the Empty Fort Strategy was used to trick the enemy into
   believing that an empty location was an ambush, in order to prevent them
   from attacking it using reverse psychology. This tactic also relied on
   luck, should the enemy believe that the location is a threat to them.

   In the 6th century BCE Greek Bias of Priene successfully resisted the
   Lydian king Alyattes by fattening up a pair of mules and driving them out
   of the besieged city.^[10] When Alyattes' envoy was then sent to Priene,
   Bias had piles of sand covered with wheat to give the impression of
   plentiful resources.

   This ruse appears to have been well known in medieval Europe: defenders in
   castles or towns under siege would throw food from the walls to show
   besiegers that provisions were plentiful. A famous example occurs in the
   8th-century legend of Lady Carcas, who supposedly persuaded the Franks to
   abandon a five-year siege by this means and gave her name to Carcassonne
   as a result.

   During the Granada War, Spanish captain Hernán Pérez del Pulgar routinely
   employed psychological tactics as part of his guerrilla actions against
   the Emirate of Granada. In 1490, infiltrating the city by night with a
   small retinue of soldiers, he nailed a letter of challenge on the main
   mosque and set fire to the alcaicería before withdrawing.^[11]

   In 1574, having been informed about the pirate attacks previous to the
   Battle of Manila, Spanish captain Juan de Salcedo had his relief force
   return to the city by night while playing marching music and carrying
   torches in loose formations, so they would appear to be a much larger army
   to any nearby enemy. They reached the city unopposed.^[12]

   During the Attack on Marstrand in 1719, Peter Tordenskjold carried out
   military deception against the Swedes. Although probably apocryphal, he
   apparently succeeded in making his small force appear larger and feed
   disinformation to his opponents, similar to the Operations Fortitude and
   Titanic in World War II.

  World War I[edit]

   [IMG]Lord Bryce led the commission of 1915 to document German atrocities
   committed against Belgian civilians.

   The start of modern psychological operations in war is generally dated to
   World War I. By that point, Western societies were increasingly educated
   and urbanized, and mass media was available in the form of large
   circulation newspapers and posters. It was also possible to transmit
   propaganda to the enemy via the use of airborne leaflets or through
   explosive delivery systems like modified artillery or mortar rounds.^[13]

   At the start of the war, the belligerents, especially the British and
   Germans, began distributing propaganda, both domestically and on the
   Western front. The British had several advantages that allowed them to
   succeed in the battle for world opinion; they had one of the world's most
   reputable news systems, with much experience in international and
   cross-cultural communication, and they controlled much of the undersea
   communications cable system then in operation. These capabilities were
   easily transitioned to the task of warfare.

   The British also had a diplomatic service that maintained good relations
   with many nations around the world, in contrast to the reputation of the
   German services.^[14] While German attempts to foment revolution in parts
   of the British Empire, such as Ireland and India, were ineffective,
   extensive experience in the Middle East allowed the British to
   successfully induce the Arabs to revolt against the Ottoman Empire.

   In August 1914, David Lloyd George appointed a Member of Parliament (MP),
   Charles Masterman, to head a Propaganda Agency at Wellington House. A
   distinguished body of literary talent was enlisted for the task, with its
   members including Arthur Conan Doyle, Ford Madox Ford, G. K. Chesterton,
   Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling and H. G. Wells. Over 1,160 pamphlets were
   published during the war and distributed to neutral countries, and
   eventually, to Germany. One of the first significant publications, the
   Report on Alleged German Outrages of 1915, had a great effect on general
   opinion across the world. The pamphlet documented atrocities, both actual
   and alleged, committed by the German army against Belgian civilians. A
   Dutch illustrator, Louis Raemaekers, provided the highly emotional
   drawings which appeared in the pamphlet.^[15]

   In 1917, the bureau was subsumed into the new Department of Information
   and branched out into telegraph communications, radio, newspapers,
   magazines and the cinema. In 1918, Viscount Northcliffe was appointed
   Director of Propaganda in Enemy Countries. The department was split
   between propaganda against Germany organized by H.G Wells, and propaganda
   against the Austro-Hungarian Empire supervised by Wickham Steed and Robert
   William Seton-Watson; the attempts of the latter focused on the lack of
   ethnic cohesion in the Empire and stoked the grievances of minorities such
   as the Croats and Slovenes. It had a significant effect on the final
   collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Army at the Battle of Vittorio
   Veneto.^[13]

   Aerial leaflets were dropped over German trenches containing postcards
   from prisoners of war detailing their humane conditions, surrender notices
   and general propaganda against the Kaiser and the German generals. By the
   end of the war, MI7b had distributed almost 26 million leaflets. The
   Germans began shooting the leaflet-dropping pilots, prompting the British
   to develop unmanned leaflet balloons that drifted across no-man's land. At
   least one in seven of these leaflets were not handed in by the soldiers to
   their superiors, despite severe penalties for that offence. Even General
   Hindenburg admitted that "Unsuspectingly, many thousands consumed the
   poison", and POWs admitted to being disillusioned by the propaganda
   leaflets that depicted the use of German troops as mere cannon fodder. In
   1915, the British began airdropping a regular leaflet newspaper Le
   Courrier de l'Air for civilians in German-occupied France and
   Belgium.^[16]

   At the start of the war, the French government took control of the media
   to suppress negative coverage. Only in 1916, with the establishment of the
   Maison de la Presse, did they begin to use similar tactics for the purpose
   of psychological warfare. One of its sections was the "Service de la
   Propagande aérienne" (Aerial Propaganda Service), headed by Professor
   Tonnelat and Jean-Jacques Waltz, an Alsatian artist code-named "Hansi".
   The French tended to distribute leaflets of images only, although the full
   publication of US President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, which had
   been heavily edited in the German newspapers, was distributed via airborne
   leaflets by the French.^[13]

   The Central Powers were slow to use these techniques; however, at the
   start of the war the Germans succeeded in inducing the Sultan of the
   Ottoman Empire to declare 'holy war', or Jihad, against the Western
   infidels. They also attempted to foment rebellion against the British
   Empire in places as far afield as Ireland, Afghanistan, and India. The
   Germans' greatest success was in giving the Russian revolutionary, Lenin,
   free transit on a sealed train from Switzerland to Finland after the
   overthrow of the Tsar. This soon paid off when the Bolshevik Revolution
   took Russia out of the war.^[17]

  World War II[edit]

   Adolf Hitler was greatly influenced by the psychological tactics of
   warfare the British had employed during World War I, and attributed the
   defeat of Germany to the effects this propaganda had on the soldiers. He
   became committed to the use of mass propaganda to influence the minds of
   the German population in the decades to come. By calling his movement The
   Third Reich, he was able to convince many civilians that his cause was not
   just a fad, but the way of their future. Joseph Goebbels was appointed as
   Propaganda Minister when Hitler came to power in 1933, and he portrayed
   Hitler as a messianic figure for the redemption of Germany. Hitler also
   coupled this with the resonating projections of his orations for effect.

   Germany's Fall Grün plan of invasion of Czechoslovakia had a large part
   dealing with psychological warfare aimed both at the Czechoslovak
   civilians and government as well as, crucially, at Czechoslovakia's
   allies.^[18] It became successful to the point that Germany gained support
   of UK and France through appeasement to occupy Czechoslovakia without
   having to fight an all-out war, sustaining only minimum losses in covert
   war before the Munich Agreement.

   At the start of the Second World War, the British set up the Political
   Warfare Executive to produce and distribute propaganda. Through the use of
   powerful transmitters, broadcasts could be made across Europe. Sefton
   Delmer managed a successful black propaganda campaign through several
   radio stations which were designed to be popular with German troops while
   at the same time introducing news material that would weaken their morale
   under a veneer of authenticity. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill
   made use of radio broadcasts for propaganda against the Germans. Churchill
   favoured deception; he said "In wartime, truth is so precious that she
   should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.".^[19]

   [IMG]Map depicting the targets of all the subordinate plans of Operation
   Bodyguard.

   During World War II, the British made extensive use of deception –
   developing many new techniques and theories. The main protagonists at this
   time were 'A' Force, set up in 1940 under Dudley Clarke, and the London
   Controlling Section, chartered in 1942 under the control of John
   Bevan.^[20]^[21] Clarke pioneered many of the strategies of military
   deception. His ideas for combining fictional orders of battle, visual
   deception and double agents helped define Allied deception strategy during
   the war, for which he has been referred to as "the greatest British
   deceiver of WW2".^[22]

   During the lead-up to the Allied invasion of Normandy, many new tactics in
   psychological warfare were devised. The plan for Operation Bodyguard set
   out a general strategy to mislead German high command as to the date and
   location of the invasion, which was obviously going to happen. Planning
   began in 1943 under the auspices of the London Controlling Section (LCS).
   A draft strategy, referred to as Plan Jael, was presented to Allied high
   command at the Tehran Conference. Operation Fortitude was intended to
   convince the Germans of a greater Allied military strength than was the
   case, through fictional field armies, faked operations to prepare the
   ground for invasion and "leaked" misinformation about the Allied order of
   battle and war plans.

   Elaborate naval deceptions (Operations Glimmer, Taxable and Big Drum) were
   undertaken in the English Channel.^[23] Small ships and aircraft simulated
   invasion fleets lying off Pas de Calais, Cap d'Antifer and the western
   flank of the real invasion force.^[24] At the same time Operation Titanic
   involved the RAF dropping fake paratroopers to the east and west of the
   Normandy landings.

   [IMG]A dummy Sherman tank, used to deceive the Germans.

   The deceptions were implemented with the use of double agents, radio
   traffic and visual deception. The British "Double Cross" anti-espionage
   operation had proven very successful from the outset of the war,^[25] and
   the LCS was able to use double agents to send back misleading information
   about Allied invasion plans.^[26] The use of visual deception, including
   mock tanks and other military hardware had been developed during the North
   Africa campaign. Mock hardware was created for Bodyguard; in particular,
   dummy landing craft were stockpiled to give the impression that the
   invasion would take place near Calais.

   The Operation was a strategic success and the Normandy landings caught
   German defences unawares. Continuing deception, portraying the landings as
   a diversion from a forthcoming main invasion in the Calais region, led
   Hitler into delaying transferring forces from Calais to the real
   battleground for nearly seven weeks.^[27]

  Vietnam War[edit]

   [IMG]"Viet Cong, beware!" – South Vietnam leaflets urging the defection of
   Viet Cong.

   The United States ran an extensive program of psychological warfare during
   the Vietnam War. The Phoenix Program had the dual aim of assassinating
   National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (NLF or Viet Cong) personnel
   and terrorizing any potential sympathizers or passive supporters. During
   the Phoenix Program, over 19,000 NLF supporters were killed.^[28] The
   United States also used tapes of distorted human sounds and played them
   during the night making the Vietnamese soldiers think that the dead were
   back for revenge.

   The Vietcong and their forces also used a program of psychological warfare
   during this war. Trịnh Thị Ngọ([ṯɕïŋ˧ˀ˨ʔ tʰi˧ˀ˨ʔ ŋɔ˧ˀ˨ʔ]; 1931 – 30
   September 2016), also known as Thu Hương and Hanoi Hannah, was a
   Vietnamese radio personality. She made English-language broadcasts for
   North Vietnam directed at United States troops. During the Vietnam War,
   Ngọ became famous among US soldiers for her propaganda broadcasts on Radio
   Hanoi. Her scripts were written by the North Vietnamese Army and were
   intended to frighten and shame the soldiers into leaving their posts. She
   made three broadcasts a day, reading a list of newly killed or imprisoned
   Americans, and playing popular US anti-war songs in an effort to incite
   feelings of nostalgia and homesickness, attempting to persuade US GIs that
   the US involvement in the Vietnam War was unjust and immoral.^[29] A
   typical broadcast began as follows:

     How are you, GI Joe? It seems to me that most of you are poorly informed
     about the going of the war, to say nothing about a correct explanation
     of your presence over here. Nothing is more confused than to be ordered
     into a war to die or to be maimed for life without the faintest idea of
     what's going on.^[30]

  21st century[edit]

   a caricature of Al-Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi caught in a
   rat trap. The caption reads "This is your future, Zarqawi".

   The CIA made extensive use of Contra soldiers to destabilize the
   Sandinista government in Nicaragua.^[31] The CIA used psychological
   warfare techniques against the Panamanians by delivering unlicensed TV
   broadcasts. The United States government has used propaganda broadcasts
   against the Cuban government through TV Marti, based in Miami, Florida.
   However, the Cuban government has been successful at jamming the signal of
   TV Marti.

   In the Iraq War, the United States used the shock and awe campaign to
   psychologically maim and break the will of the Iraqi Army to fight.

   In cyberspace, social media has enabled the use of disinformation on a
   wide scale. Analysts have found evidence of doctored or misleading
   photographs spread by social media in the Syrian Civil War and 2014
   Russian military intervention in Ukraine, possibly with state
   involvement.^[32] Military and governments have engaged in psychological
   operations (PSYOP) and informational warfare (IW) on social networking
   platforms to regulate foreign propaganda, which includes countries like
   the US, Russia, and China.^[33]^[34]

   In 2022, Meta and the Stanford Internet Observatory found that over five
   years people associated with the U.S. military, who tried to conceal their
   identities, created fake accounts on social media systems including
   Balatarin, Facebook, Instagram, Odnoklassniki, Telegram, Twitter,
   VKontakte and YouTube in an influence operation in Central Asia and the
   Middle East. Their posts, primarily in Arabic, Farsi and Russian,
   criticized Iran, China and Russia and gave pro-Western narratives. Data
   suggested the activity was a series of covert campaigns rather than a
   single operation.^[35]^[36]

   In operations in the South and East China Seas, both the United States and
   China have been engaged in "Cognitive Warfare", which involves both
   displays of force, staged photographs and sharing of
   disinformation.^[37]^[38]^[39]

   Most modern uses of the term psychological warfare refer to the following
   military methods:

     * Demoralization:
          * Distributing pamphlets that encourage desertion or supply
            instructions on how to surrender.
          * Shock and awe military strategy.
          * Projecting repetitive and disturbing noises and music for long
            periods at high volume towards groups under siege like during
            Operation Nifty Package.
     * Propaganda radio stations, such as Lord Haw-Haw in World War II on the
       "Germany calling" station.
     * Renaming cities and other places when captured, such as the renaming
       of Saigon to Ho Chi Minh City after Communist victory in the Vietnam
       War.
     * False flag events.
     * Terrorism^[40]
     * The threat of chemical weapons.^[41]
     * Information warfare.

   Most of these techniques were developed during World War II or earlier,
   and have been used to some degree in every conflict since. Daniel Lerner
   was in the OSS (the predecessor to the American CIA) and in his book,
   attempts to analyze how effective the various strategies were. He
   concludes that there is little evidence that any of them were dramatically
   successful, except perhaps surrender instructions over loudspeakers when
   victory was imminent. Measuring the success or failure of psychological
   warfare is very hard, as the conditions are very far from being a
   controlled experiment.

   Lerner also divides psychological warfare operations into three
   categories:^[42]^[page needed]

     * White propaganda (omissions and emphasis): Truthful and not strongly
       biased, where the source of information is acknowledged.
     * Grey propaganda (omissions, emphasis and racial/ethnic/religious
       bias): Largely truthful, containing no information that can be proven
       wrong; the source is not identified.
     * Black propaganda (commissions of falsification): Inherently deceitful,
       information given in the product is attributed to a source that was
       not responsible for its creation.

   Lerner says grey and black operations ultimately have a heavy cost, in
   that the target population sooner or later recognizes them as propaganda
   and discredits the source. He writes, "This is one of the few dogmas
   advanced by Sykewarriors that is likely to endure as an axiom of
   propaganda: Credibility is a condition of persuasion. Before you can make
   a man do as you say, you must make him believe what you say."^[42]^: 28 
   Consistent with this idea, the Allied strategy in World War II was
   predominantly one of truth (with certain exceptions).^[citation needed]

   In Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes, Jacques Ellul discusses
   psychological warfare as a common peace policy practice between nations as
   a form of indirect aggression. This type of propaganda drains the public
   opinion of an opposing regime by stripping away its power on public
   opinion. This form of aggression is hard to defend against because no
   international court of justice is capable of protecting against
   psychological aggression since it cannot be legally adjudicated.

     "Here the propagandists is [sic] dealing with a foreign adversary whose
     morale he seeks to destroy by psychological means so that the opponent
     begins to doubt the validity of his beliefs and actions."^[43]^[44]

By country[edit]

  China[edit]

   According to U.S. military analysts, attacking the enemy's mind is an
   important element of the People's Republic of China's military
   strategy.^[45]^[46]^[47] This type of warfare is rooted in the Chinese
   Stratagems outlined by Sun Tzu in The Art of War and Thirty-Six
   Stratagems. In its dealings with its rivals, China is expected to utilize
   Marxism to mobilize communist loyalists, as well as flex its economic and
   military muscle to persuade other nations to act in the Chinese
   government's interests. The Chinese government also tries to control the
   media to keep a tight hold on propaganda efforts for its people.^[47] The
   Chinese government also utilizes cognitive warfare against Taiwan.^[48]

  France[edit]

   The Centre interarmées des actions sur l'environnement is an organization
   made up of 300 soldiers whose mission is to assure to the four service arm
   of the French Armed Forces psychological warfare capacities. Deployed in
   particular to Mali and Afghanistan, its missions "consist in better
   explaining and accepting the action of French forces in operation with
   local actors and thus gaining their trust: direct aid to the populations,
   management of reconstruction sites, actions of communication of influence
   with the population, elites and local elected officials". The center has
   capacities for analysis, influence, expertise and instruction.^[49]

  Germany[edit]

   In the German Bundeswehr, the Zentrum Operative Kommunikation is
   responsible PSYOP efforts. The center is subordinate to the Cyber and
   Information Domain Service branch alongside multiple IT and Electronic
   Warfare battalions and consists of around 1000 soldiers. One project of
   the German PSYOP forces is the radio station Stimme der Freiheit (Sada-e
   Azadi, Voice of Freedom),^[50] heard by thousands of Afghans. Another is
   the publication of various newspapers and magazines in Kosovo and
   Afghanistan, where German soldiers serve with NATO.

  Iran[edit]

   The Iranian government had an operation program to use the 2022 FIFA World
   Cup as a psyop against concurrent people's
   protests.^[51]^[52]^[53]^[54]^[55]

  Israel[edit]

   The Israeli government and its military make use of psychological warfare.
   In 2021, Israeli newspaper Haaretz revealed that "Abu Ali Express", a
   popular news page on Telegram and Twitter purportedly dedicated to "Arab
   affairs", was actually run by a Jewish Israeli paid consultant to the
   Israel Defense Forces. The IDF's psyops account had been the source of a
   number of noteworthy reports that were afterwards cited by the Israeli and
   international media. Abu Ali Express was, for example, the source for the
   report that Qatari funds were entering the Gaza Strip in suitcases.^[56]

  United Kingdom[edit]

   The British were one of the first major military powers to use
   psychological warfare in the First and Second World Wars. In the current
   British Armed Forces, PsyOps are handled by the tri-service 15
   Psychological Operations Group. (See also MI5 and Secret Intelligence
   Service). The Psychological Operations Group comprises over 150 personnel,
   approximately 75 from the regular Armed Services and 75 from the Reserves.
   The Group supports deployed commanders in the provision of psychological
   operations in operational and tactical environments.^[57]^[58]

   The Group was established immediately after the 1991 Gulf War,^[59] has
   since grown significantly in size to meet operational requirements,^[60]
   and since 2015 has been one of the sub-units of the 77th Brigade, formerly
   called the Security Assistance Group.^[61]

   In June 2015, NSA files published by Glenn Greenwald revealed details of
   the JTRIG group at British intelligence agency GCHQ covertly manipulating
   online communities.^[62] This is in line with JTRIG's goal: to "destroy,
   deny, degrade [and] disrupt" enemies by "discrediting" them, planting
   misinformation and shutting down their communications.^[63]

   In March 2019, it emerged that the Defence Science and Technology
   Laboratory (DSTL) of the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) is tendering to
   arms companies and universities for £70M worth of assistance under a
   project to develop new methods of psychological warfare. The project is
   known as the human and social sciences research capability (HSSRC).^[64]

   The term psychological warfare is believed to have migrated from Germany
   to the United States in 1941.^[65] During World War II, the United States
   Joint Chiefs of Staff defined psychological warfare broadly, stating
   "Psychological warfare employs any weapon to influence the mind of the
   enemy. The weapons are psychological only in the effect they produce and
   not because of the weapons themselves."^[66] The U.S. Department of
   Defense currently defines psychological warfare as:

     "The planned use of propaganda and other psychological actions having
     the primary purpose of influencing the opinions, emotions, attitudes,
     and behavior of hostile foreign groups in such a way as to support the
     achievement of national objectives."^[67]

   This definition indicates that a critical element of the U.S.
   psychological operations capabilities includes propaganda and by extension
   counterpropaganda. Joint Publication 3–53 establishes specific policy to
   use public affairs mediums to counter propaganda from foreign
   origins.^[68]

   The purpose of United States psychological operations is to induce or
   reinforce attitudes and behaviors favorable to US objectives. The Special
   Activities Center (SAC) is a division of the Central Intelligence Agency's
   National Clandestine Service, responsible for Covert Action and "Special
   Activities". These special activities include covert political influence
   (which includes psychological operations) and paramilitary
   operations.^[69] SAC's political influence group is the only US unit
   allowed to conduct these operations covertly and is considered the primary
   unit in this area.^[69]

   Dedicated psychological operations units exist in the United States Army
   and United States Marine Corps. The United States Navy and the 193rd
   Special Operations Wing of the United States Air Force also plans and
   executes limited PSYOP missions. United States PSYOP units and soldiers of
   all branches of the military are prohibited by law from targeting U.S.
   citizens with PSYOP within the borders of the United States (Executive
   Order S-1233, DOD Directive S-3321.1, and National Security Decision
   Directive 130). While United States Army PSYOP units may offer non-PSYOP
   support to domestic military missions, they can only target foreign
   audiences.

   A U.S. Army field manual released in January 2013 states that "Inform and
   Influence Activities" are critical for describing, directing, and leading
   military operations. Several Army Division leadership staff are assigned
   to “planning, integration and synchronization of designated
   information-related capabilities."^[70]

   In September 2022, an audit of covert information warfare took place after
   social media companies identified a suspected U.S. military
   operation.^[71]
