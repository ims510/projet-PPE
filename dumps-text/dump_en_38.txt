          Ukraine expands control on Dnipro's left bank

   Germany will supply Ukraine with 20,000 more
   strategically-important 155mm artillery shells as part of a new £1.1
   billion military aid package.

   Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said the package would also include
   four additional IRIS-T air defence units and anti-tank mines.

   The artillery shells come on top of 140,000 155mm rounds Germany has
   already pledged to deliver next year.

   Volodymyr Zelensky said last week that artillery shell deliveries had
   “really slowed down” since the Israel-Hamas war began, with the
   European Union admitting earlier this month that it would fail to meet
   its pledge to supply one million shells by March next year.

   “This underlines that we stand with Ukraine sustainably and reliably,”
   Mr Pistorius said during an unannounced visit to Kyiv on Tuesday.

   The aid will supplement an £880,000 “winter package” announced by
   Berlin last month.

   Germany is the second-largest donor of military aid to Ukraine behind
   the United States and plans to double its commitment next year to
   £6.8bn.

We'll lose 'war of exhaustion', Ukrainian soldiers complain

   Ukrainian soldiers fear they will lose a “war of exhaustion” with
   Russia as their frontline units deplete in strength.

   Units fighting at the front are between 20 and 40 per cent below
   strength and “those remaining are tired,” retired Ukrainian lieutenant
   general Ihor Romanenko told the Wall Street Journal.

   “We don’t have a chance playing war of exhaustion with Russia,” said
   Private Bohdan Lysenko of the 47th Brigade, whose unit is defending
   Avdiivka with just 20 men, down from a peak in the summer of 120.

   “They’re not stupid. It’s a strategy… We don’t have enough ammunition,
   but they [the Russians] have enough people,” added Corporal Mykhailo
   Kotsyurba, who is in the same company as Pvt Lysenko.

   Britain and the US both estimate that Russia has lost more than 300,000
   killed and wounded soldiers during the war so far.

   “They treat us as waste material,” said Andrei Bednyaev, a Russian
   infantryman being held captive by the Ukrainians.

   The frontline has become increasingly stationary in recent months amid
   growing fears that the West cannot provide enough funding and arms for
   Ukraine to break through.
   2:22PM

Ukraine denies plan to sack two more generals

   Ukraine’s defence minister has insisted a rumoured decision to sack two
   more generals has “not yet been made”.

   “I must say that the decision has not yet been made, but we are doing
   everything possible to improve efficiency,” Rustem Umerov told
   reporters.

   Media reports emerged last week that Ukraine would sack Lt Gen Serhii
   Naiev, who is joint forces commander, Maj Gen Tetiana Ostashchenko,
   commander of the medical forces, and Brig Gen Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, who
   leads the southern Tavria command.

   The reports were denied but Maj Gen Ostashchenko was then sacked on
   Sunday night, sparking speculation that Lt Gen Naiev and Brig Gen
   Tarnavskyi would follow.

Analysis: Ukraine turns to the EU for support amid Israel-Hamas war

   Charles Michel, one of the EU’s most a senior officials, arrived in
   Kyiv on Tuesday at a time when the Ukrainians are looking for Europe
   for support more than ever before, reports Joe Barnes, our Brussels
   Correspondent.

   Funding from the United States is starting to dwindle and the route
   into Nato is closed as long as fighting continues.

   This leaves Ukraine with limited avenues to find large international
   organisations willing to support it with new funds and not just
   rhetoric. The EU is seen as perhaps the last viable option on the
   table.

   And with war waging between Israel and Hamas, Washington has
   increasingly pressured Brussels to take up the mantle of supporting
   Ukraine.

   The pledges made by European governments – including by Germany, which
   has announced a doubling of military support – are starting to reflect
   this shift.

   Mr Michel, the European Council’s president, will play a key role in
   this assistance when he chairs talks in December over whether Ukraine
   can start accession negotiations with the EU and receive a €20billion
   military aid package.

   Neither of those are certainties.

   “When I say this will be a difficult European summit, this is a fact”,
   Mr Michel said. “I will spare no effort to have a positive decision in
   December, but can’t predict what happens – not everything is black and
   white.”
   1:56PM

Germany announces new $1.4billion in aid for Ukraine

   Germany has announced a new $1.4billion (£1.1billion) aid package for
   Ukraine.

   Defence minister Boris Pistorius is visiting Kyiv today and said the
   deal will include four new IRIS-T air-to-air missile units.

   “I am sure this will help you in your fight against the Russian
   aggression,” he said. “This underlines that we stand with Ukraine
   sustainably and reliably.”

   The deal also includes anti-tank mines and an additional 20,000
   artillery shells.

   Germany is the second-largest donor of military aid to Ukraine, behind
   the United States.

Ukraine MP offered official $50k crypto bribe

   A Ukrainian MP who sits on an anti-corruption committee in parliament
   has been accused of offering a $50,000 (£40,000) cryptocurrency bribe
   to a state official, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) has
   said.

   NABU did not name the MP and it is not clear whether he has been
   arrested or charged.

   He is said to have made the offer to the head of the State Agency for
   Reconstruction and Infrastructure Development, who informed anti-graft
   investigators.

   The agency said it had “zero tolerance for corruption”.

   The MP is reported to have wanted assistance in obtaining state funds
   for infrastructure repairs in exchange for the bribe.

Ukraine's secret service detains priest for 'pro-Russian sermons'

   Ukraine’s secret service has detained a priest for including
   pro-Russian propaganda in his sermons and criticising the Ukrainian
   army.

   The clergyman, in the Russia-linked Ukrainian Orthodox Church, is also
   said to have praised Russian-backed warlords in Donetsk on his Telegram
   channel.

   The priest served in the western city of Vinnytsia but was in hiding
   when he was detained, the SBU said.

   Ukraine has two main Orthodox churches, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church
   (Moscow Patriarchate) and the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (Kyiv
   Patriarchate).

   It has accused the former of aligning with Russia during the war, which
   the church denies.

US to send more Himars to Ukraine in new $100m package

   The US is sending more Himars rockets to Ukraine as part of a new
   $100million (£80million) aid package, defence secretary Lloyd Austin
   announced on a surprise visit to Kyiv.

   It will also send Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, Javelin anti-tank
   rockets and more than three million rounds of small arms ammunition.

   The deal was agreed as Mr Austin visited Kyiv to “reaffirm the United
   States’ steadfast support for Ukraine”.

   There has been months of increasing political division over support for
   Ukraine in the US, where Congress has refused to vote through an
   additional $60billion (£48.8billion) in funding requested by President
   Joe Biden.

   National security adviser Jake Sullivan said earlier this month that
   Washington’s ability to support Kyiv is getting “harder and harder”
   with “each week that passes”.

Russia and India hold joint naval drills

   Russia and India are holding joint naval exercises in the Bay of
   Bengal, Moscow’s defence ministry has said.

   “The purpose of the exercise is to comprehensively develop and
   strengthen naval co-operation between Russia and India,” it said.

   The exercises will last until Wednesday and involve ships from Russia’s
   Pacific fleet.

   Russia is trying to boost its presence in the region and last week held
   drills with Myanmar.

   India has not sanctioned Russia over the war in Ukraine and the US has
   previously voiced concerns about the possibility of joint naval drills.

Ukraine's dream to join EU now a 'reality', says Zelensky

   Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ukraine’s once “romantic dream” of joining
   the European Union is now a “reality”.

   “Therefore, our candidate status and further accession negotiations
   should certainly result in Ukraine’s full membership in the EU,” he
   said in a video address to mark the 10th anniversary of the start of
   the Maidan protests.

   “And we are doing all this despite the war, when our people are
   defending themselves and Europe right now.”

   10:21AM

Maidan a 'foreign coup', says Kremlin

   The Kremlin has condemned the 2014 Maidan revolution as a “foreign
   coup” as Ukraine celebrates the 10th anniversary of the start of
   pro-European Union protests.

   “The fact that it was sponsored from abroad has been acknowledged,
   directly and indirectly, by representatives of foreign countries,”
   Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.

   “That is no secret to anyone.”

   9:50AM

Moldova and Ukraine set for EU talks in Kyiv

   European Council president Charles Michel and Moldovan president Maia
   Sandu have both arrived in Kyiv this morning to discuss Ukraine and
   Moldova’s accession to the European Union.

   Ms Sandu said: “On our agenda: discussing next steps in EU accession of
   Moldova and Ukraine, enhancing regional security, and EU’s continued
   support of reforms and development in our countries.”

   “Good to be back in Kyiv – among friends,” added Mr Michel on X,
   formerly Twitter.

Russia cannot co-exist with Zelensky's Ukraine, says diplomat

   Russia cannot co-exist with Volodymyr Zelensky’s Ukraine, a diplomat
   has said.

   “The current regime is absolutely toxic, we do not see any options for
   co-existence with it at the moment,” Rodion Miroshnik, Russia’s
   ambassador-at-large, told reporters in Moscow.

   He accused Ukraine of war crimes against civilians and said the West
   would eventually lose interest in the war.

   “We can resist Nato just as much as we need to fulfill the tasks that
   the president has formulated,” he added.

   9:35AM

MoD: Russia stockpiling cruise missiles for winter bombardment

   Russia has not used its “premier” cruise missiles for two months as it
   builds a stockpile for a winter bombardment of Ukrainian
   infrastructure, the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said.

   “Russia is highly likely to use these missiles if it repeats last
   year’s effort to destroy Ukraine’s critical national infrastructure,”
   it said in its latest defence intelligence update.

   The MoD added that Russia has been instead using Iranian-designed
   Shahed kamikaze drones to “degrade Ukraine’s air defences” before “any
   concerted winter campaign of strikes against Ukraine’s energy
   infrastructure”.

Russia may seek compensation for Nord Stream

   Russia may seek compensation for the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas
   pipelines but will first wait for an investigation to conclude.

   The pipelines under the Baltic Sea were damaged in explosions in
   September 2022 but no culprit has been identified yet.

   “The probe is not over yet, we are waiting for its results to be
   presented to the (United Nations) Security Council, then we will decide
   what to do,” Dmitry Birichevsky, a foreign ministry official, replied
   to a question on compensation asked by the Russian state news agency
   RIA.

   Sweden, Denmark and Germany are leading the investigation. Russia has
   blamed the US, Britain and Ukraine, which the three countries have
   denied.

We've fought off Ukraine's Dnipro crossing attempts, claims Russia

   Russian soldiers have fought off attempts by Ukraine to establish new
   footholds on the left bank of the Dnipro, its defence ministry has
   claimed.

   Contradicting open source analysis and Russian bloggers, the ministry
   said marines, aviation and artillery were “stopping all attempts by the
   armed forces of Ukraine to carry out amphibious landings on the Dnipro
   islands and the left bank of the Dnipro river.”

   It added that Ukrainian forces were suffering heavy casualties and
   losing equipment in these attempts.

   The defence ministry also published a video which it said showed
   marines defeating Ukrainian soldiers. Soldiers can be seen firing a
   variety of weapons in the footage but the outcome of the fighting shown
   is not clear.

Russian strikes overnight kill three and injure eight

   Russian strikes have killed two civilians and injured six in the
   eastern Donetsk and Kharkiv regions.

   A hospital and a coal mine in Selydove, a town in Donetsk, were struck
   by missiles, injuring eight, killing two and temporarily trapping 39
   miners underground.

   Another Ukrainian was killed by shelling in Kharkiv, its governor Oleh
   Synehubov said.

Zelensky hails Maidan protestors as 'first counter-offensive'

   Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the 2014 Maidan protestors as Ukraine’s
   “first counter-offensive” on the 10th anniversary of the pro-European
   Union protests.

   “10 years ago, we began a new chapter in our struggle,” he said.

   “10 years ago, Ukrainians launched their first counteroffensive.
   Against lawlessness and an attempt to rob us of our European future.
   Against unfreedom.
   ”Year after year, step by step, we make every effort to ensure that,
   among the other stars on the EU flag, which represents the unity of
   European nations, our star shines as well. The Ukrainian star.”

Ukraine expands control on Dnipro's left bank

   Ukraine has expanded its control of the Dnipro river’s left bank, the
   Institute for the Study of War think tank has said.

   It cited reports by Russian bloggers that Ukrainian soldiers have
   advanced to the west of Krynky, where fighting continues.

   Commandos first crossed the river in October and Ukraine has since
   consolidated its bridgehead, pushing Russian forces back by as many as
   five miles.

   Securing the strategic advance would raise the prospect of further
   southward advances towards Crimea.

ISW: Russia using migrants to destabilise Nato on Finnish border

   Russia is using migrants to destabilise Nato on Finland’s border, the
   Institute for the Study of War think tank has said.

   Finland has closed four border crossings with Russia and has is
   considering shutting the remaining four after an influx of African and
   Middle Eastern migrants it says is being directed by Moscow.

   The ISW said Russia is doing so as part of a “hybrid warfare tactic”
   and is likely planning to portray Finland’s response to the migrant
   crisis as Nato aggression.

   “ISW has also consistently assessed that one of Putin’s goals in
   launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was to break up
   Nato – a goal he continues to pursue,” it said.

   The think tank added that it was similar to the migrant crisis which
   Russia and Belarus created on Poland’s border in 2021 by funneling
   migrants towards it.

US sanctions Russian officers for Bucha and Andriivka war crimes

   The US has sanctioned two Russian officers who killed civilians in
   Bucha and Andriivka at the beginning of the war in Ukraine.

   Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov, who is known as the butcher of Bucha, was
   the commanding officer of a Russian brigade that occupied Andriivka and
   Bucha, north of Kyiv, in early 2022.

   He killed, beat, dismembered, burned and conducted mock executions of
   civilians in Bucha, the US state department said. He was awarded
   Russia’s highest honour by Vladimir Putin in July 2022.

   Corporal Daniil Frolkin, a member of Col Omurbekov’s brigade, confessed
   to journalists in August 2022 that he killed a civilian in Andriivka in
   March 2022. He was given a suspended five-and-a-half year sentence by a
   Russian military court for spreading “false information” about the army
   in March this year.

   Russian forces killed hundreds of civilians in Bucha and Andriivka.

   The American sanctions bar Col Omurbekov, Cpl Frolkin and their
   immediate families from entering the country.

German defence minister visits Kyiv

   German defence minister Boris Pistorius has made a surprise visit to
   Kyiv.

   He visited a memorial to the 2014 Euromaidan revolution on the 10th
   anniversary of the day it started, laying flowers in commemoration of
   those who died.

   “I am here again, firstly to pledge further support, but also to
   express our solidarity and deep bond and also our admiration for the
   courageous, brave and costly fight that is being waged here,” he said.

   Mr Pistorius is set to meet Volodomyr Zelensky and defence minister
   Rustem Umerov.

   Germany is the world’s second-largest provider of military aid to
   Ukraine after the US.
