                     A roadmap for the future of Palestine

   At this critical juncture, Palestine’s leaders should come together to
   craft a clear strategy for reunifying the Palestinian people

   As Israel continues its war on Gaza, which is causing loss of life and
   displacement at a scale that has led to it being labeled a “genocide” by
   various experts, the Palestinian liberation struggle is at a critical
   juncture.

   Despite undoubtedly recognising the importance of the current moment,
   however, Palestinian political factions, including Hamas and Fatah among
   others, appear unable to come together and lay out a coherent and
   realistic vision for the future of Palestine. It’s imperative for them to
   set aside their differences, acknowledge their moral responsibilities to
   the nation, and come together to craft a clear strategy for reunifying the
   Palestinian people. Such a strategy must not only thwart Israel’s
   well-defined and openly discussed plan to ethnically cleanse Gaza and
   detach it from the Palestinian homeland, but also respond to Israeli
   efforts to displace Palestinians in the West Bank and Israel itself.

   As a Palestinian from Gaza, I believe at this point in the conflict,
   opportunities are ripe for putting an end to the ongoing war in Gaza,
   uniting the Palestinian factions, and launching a new political path to
   end the occupation. There are 10 clear steps that could and should be
   taken, starting with Palestinian leaders, to achieve this and put our
   nation on a direct path towards justice, peace and statehood:

    1. First and foremost, all Palestinian factions should commit to the
       fulfilment and eventual expansion of the Qatar-brokered agreement to
       exchange Israeli captives in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli
       jails.
    2. Hamas should declare its acceptance of and commitment to the Fatah
       reconciliation agreement it signed in Cairo in 2017. It should call on
       the Palestinian Authority to assume its responsibilities in Gaza and
       also reassert the commitment of resistance factions in Gaza to all
       agreements signed by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). To
       counter Israel’s destructive post-war plans for Gaza, Palestinian
       leaders should establish an interim governing council for the Strip
       comprising technocrats from the region. All past Palestinian Authority
       personnel from Gaza, including the police, should be called upon to
       return to their duties. This plan should also include retaining
       civilian Hamas employees, including the police. The reintegration of
       Hamas fighters and weaponry into the Palestinian Authority forces
       after the end of the war should also remain under consideration.
    3. Hamas should publicly acknowledge the Peace Accords signed between
       Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the
       foundation for a peace process, and agree to the scheduling of
       elections for the entire Palestinian territory within one year. In
       return, Israel should be pressured to recognise a reformed Hamas as a
       mainstream Palestinian political faction and a party to future
       negotiations.
    4. The PLO should be reactivated and reformed in a way that would ensure
       the representation of all Palestinian parties and components within
       its structures. Particular emphasis should be placed on empowering
       young Palestinians, both men and women, taking on consequential roles
       within the organisation and have a say in the future of Palestine. The
       reformed PLO should include not only Fatah, Hamas and other PLO
       factions, but also representatives from the Palestinian diaspora, as
       well as independent representatives from across the nation. Members of
       the organisation should be reelected every four years in free and fair
       elections, and it should be agreed that the organisation will have the
       final say in all critical issues concerning the Palestinian people
       until an independent Palestinian state is established.
    5. The reconstruction of Gaza should start immediately under
       international and Arab supervision. While the international community
       should contribute to funding the project, the brunt of the financial
       burden should be put on Israel as the occupying power responsible for
       causing the destruction. The reconstruction effort should be used to
       put Gaza on the path to achieving sustainable economic growth. It
       should also aim to address the rapid depletion of the Strip’s
       environmental resources as a result of the occupation, including
       issues relating to water and electricity shortages, shrinking fishing
       areas, and destruction of agricultural land among others.
    6. Israel should be made to set up a compensation fund for the families –
       both Israeli and Palestinian – victimised by its wars, aggressions and
       occupation. Western countries adopted the idea that Russia would be
       compelled to pay for its war in Ukraine, and Ukraine would be rebuilt
       using frozen Russian assets. The Palestinian leadership should insist
       that the same responsibility is imposed on Israel.
    7. International observers should be deployed along Israel’s borders to
       prevent confrontations. Turkiye [Turkey], which is accepted as an
       honest broker by the Palestinians and has strong relations with the
       West and Israel as a NATO member, could be asked to take on this
       important responsibility.
    8. The siege on Gaza should be lifted, fully and unconditionally, with
       its border crossings, airports and ports reopened and its residents
       given full freedom of movement. A permanent and secure passage between
       Gaza and the West Bank should also be established. Turkiye can also
       play a crucial role in opening Gaza up to the world, by establishing
       maritime and aerial bridges for reconstruction and development.
    9. Israel should be pressured to immediately and unconditionally halt all
       its settlement activities and initiate comprehensive negotiations for
       bringing an end to its occupation under UN auspices, based on the 1967
       borders, and within a pre-set timeframe of no more than three years.
       The Arab League should continue to push for its 2002 Arab Peace
       Initiative which called for all Arab states to recognise and normalise
       relations with Israel in exchange for the establishment of a
       Palestinian state on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its
       capital. Any further attempts at normalisation should be frozen until
       this is achieved.
   10. Finally, if this political track towards sustainable peace and
       dignified co-existence fails or faces a significant roadblock, a
       reformed PLO that is kept in check by the Palestinian people through
       regular elections should be accepted as the sole entity that could
       decide on the future direction and nature of the Palestinian struggle
       for liberation.
