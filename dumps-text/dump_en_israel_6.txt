   The newly-elected rector of St Andrews University is facing calls to
   apologise over an email accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza.

   Stella Maris said Palestinians had suffered "apartheid, siege, illegal
   occupation and collective punishment" during the Israel-Gaza war.

   Hundreds of students have demanded that she retract her remarks or resign
   just a month after taking up the role.

   St Andrews University said it was "dismayed" by the rector's comments.

   The row came as hundreds of people attended demonstrations in Scotland on
   Saturday calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.

   In Glasgow, people gathered at the Buchanan Street steps on Saturday
   holding signs and banners which said "ceasefire now".

   First Minister Humza Yousaf and Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar took
   part in the Scottish Trades Union Congress's (STUC) annual St Andrew's Day
   protest which saw marchers gather at Glasgow Green.

   Asked about the St Andrews rector's comments he said: "There are
   communities - Jewish communities, Muslim communities - who are feeling
   vulnerable and all of us have a responsibility to make sure we are
   simmering down any of those tensions as opposed to inflaming them.

   "We can do that while very passionately arguing that what's happening in
   Gaza is unacceptable."

   In a message to students sent on Tuesday, Ms Maris described how a vigil
   at the university was held earlier this month "following weeks of
   genocidal attacks by the Israeli government against Gaza".

   She said: "We must continue to recognize and condemn acts that are
   internationally regarded as humanitarian and war crimes.

   "It is also crucial to acknowledge and denounce the actions by Hamas that
   qualify as war crimes, notably the taking of hostages and deliberately
   targeting civilians, which I have and continue to do."

Human rights

   The email also included a link to a website which carried a story
   headlined: "The evidence Israel killed its own citizens on Oct 7."

   The role of rector, elected by students, is to provide pastoral support
   and represent the student community at the university's governing body
   where the rector serves as president.

   Ms Maris has rejected accusations that the message to students was
   antisemitic and argued her use of the terms genocide and apartheid were
   "supported by numerous human rights organizations".

   She told BBC Scotland News she would not be resigning and insisted she had
   done the right thing.

   Ms Maris sad: "I have received a lot of backlash and it's quite
   disappointing.

   "I really tried to write a statement that would make everyone happy, but
   realised I wasn't being true to my beliefs.

   "I'm glad I did it and it was the right thing to do."

   The rector added: "I've had racist comments as a result and have been
   accused of antisemitism, which I reject.

   "I don't intend on retracting my statement or resigning.

   "I denounce antisemitism in the strongest form. Reject the weaponising of
   antisemitism."

   However, a large group of students at the university, which was founded in
   1413 and is one of the oldest in the UK, insisted Ms Maris's comments
   "will only bring division and hatred".

   They are now calling for her to apologise or step down.

   In a letter to the rector, they say: "We are concerned that your letter
   does not demonstrate equal care for Palestinian and Israeli lives.

   "What is truly unacceptable is that you do not care to mention, let alone
   demonstrate regard for, the two St Andrews students who were recently
   attacked because of their religion.

   "Moreover, your letter does not show any appreciation for how your
   inflammatory and unfounded accusations of 'genocide,' 'apartheid,' and
   'occupation' concerning the Jewish State will further embolden attacks and
   hatred against the Jewish students whom you were elected to care for.

   "It is unacceptable for the rector to be selective in their responsibility
   to represent all students."

Free speech

   Ms Maris is a former English and philosophy graduate at the university and
   has since filled a series of student representation roles.

   She was elected rector on 10 October.

   Responding to Ms Maris's remarks, St Andrews University principal and
   vice-chancellor, Prof Dame Sally Mapstone, said the university was
   committed to free speech but that there was "no place for antisemitism,
   Islamophobia, or racism of any kind".

   She added: "We are utterly dismayed that the rector, on this occasion, put
   her right to freedom of expression ahead of her duty to represent all
   students, and to be concerned for their welfare.

   "We know that while some may have welcomed the message, others have been
   deeply offended and concerned by it.

   "While every one of us shares a desire for peace and an end to hostilities
   in Israel and Gaza, we regret that her message, the language it used, and
   some of the sources it cited have caused alarm, division, and harm in our
   community, and more widely."

Temporary truce

   The temporary truce is still holding and follows weeks of fighting and
   Israeli bombardments of Gaza, with the conflict sparked by Hamas's
   unprecedented cross-border attack in southern Israel that saw 1,200 people
   killed.

   Hamas earlier announced a delay in the release of further Israeli
   hostages, claiming Israel had broken the terms of the truce deal over aid
   deliveries to northern Gaza. Israel denied this, and the releases were due
   to resume following mediation.

   On the first day of the four-day ceasefire on Friday, Hamas released 24 of
   the about 240 hostages taken during its attack on Israel and Israel freed
   39 Palestinians from prison.

   The Israeli offensive has killed more than 14,500 Palestinians, according
   to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza government.
