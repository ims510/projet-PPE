   Israel's Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi submitted a proposal to
   take action against Haaretz by ending the publication of government
   notices in Haaretz. Karhi, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin
   Netanyahu's Likud party, said the newspaper was "sabotaging Israel in
   wartime" and was an "inflammatory mouthpiece for Israel’s enemies."

   The proposal, which was submitted without being vetted by the
   ministry's legal adviser, would immediately halt any payments to
   Haaretz from any state entity within his purview.

   Haaretz publisher Amos Schocken responded to Karhi’s proposal by
   saying, “If the government wants to close Haaretz, that’s the time to
   read Haaretz.”

   Karhi's proposal, which would forbid the publication of official
   government notices in Haaretz, and would cancel all state employee
   Haaretz subscriptions – including those held by members of the IDF, the
   police, the prison service, government ministries and government
   companies – was sent to Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs.

   In a letter to Fuchs entitled, “Taking action against the Haaretz
   newspaper for the dissemination of lying, defeatist propaganda,” Karhi
   wrote: “Since the beginning of the war, I have received many complaints
   that Haaretz has taken an offensive line which undermines the war's
   goals and disparages the military effort and its social fortitude. It
   is possible that some of the paper's publications even cross the
   criminal standard set in those far-flung sections of the penal code
   reserved for wartime only.”

   Karhi added: “The State of Israel is one of Haaretz’s customers, and
   the government has the power to decide that it isn’t interested in
   being a customer of a newspaper that is sabotaging Israel in wartime
   and undermining the spirit of Israeli soldiers and civilians in the
   face of the enemy.” He noted he was still waiting for his ministry's
   legal adviser to offer an opinion regarding his proposal, “and I don’t
   know what it will be.”

   The Israeli journalists’ union said in a statement that “the
   communications minister has lost his way. Karhi, who spent most of his
   brief tenure in failed attempts to close the public broadcasting
   corporation, has decided to tame a new target. His new proposal to end
   all government business with Haaretz is a populistic proposal devoid of
   any feasibility or logic, and its entire purpose is to garner likes
   among his political base at the expense of dedicated journalists who
   are working night and day right now to cover the war."

   “We support Haaretz’s journalists, and we’re certain they will continue
   to do important work for the benefit of Israel and won’t be deterred by
   Minister Karhi’s stupid, empty threats,” it added.

   In his letter, Karhi cited the recently approved emergency regulations
   that allow the government to take action against foreign media outlets
   that harm the country.

   “It’s inconceivable that at a time when we are taking action against
   foreign stations, an Israeli newspaper should continue to get a
   significant share of its funding from the Israeli public while it
   serves as an inflammatory mouthpiece for Israel’s enemies,” he wrote.

   The security cabinet recently authorized Karhi to take action under
   these regulations against Al Mayadeen, a Lebanese television station
   affiliated with Hezbollah that also reports from Israel, on the grounds
   that it harms national security and serves a terrorist organization.
   Karhi subsequently signed an order blocking the station’s internet
   channel in Israel and asked the army to issue a closure order for its
   offices in the West Bank.

   However, the cabinet refused to approve his request to close the Qatari
   station Al Jazeera, in part because of Qatar’s involvement in
   negotiations for the release of the hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza
   Strip.

   Prominent journalists from around the world have denounced Karhi's
   threats. CNN's Jake Tapper tweeted: "A push to undermine the free press
   from the Netanyahu government." The Nation's Jeet Heer wrote: "Haaretz
   is a great newspaper, needed now more than ever." Yashar Ali, who
   writes for the Huffington Post and the New York Magazine, wrote in
   response: "I just subscribed."
