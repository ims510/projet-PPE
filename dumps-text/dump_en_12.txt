Children Under Attack

Children are coming under attack in conflicts across the world. We can’t
accept this as a ‘new normal.’

   Around the world, attacks on children continue unabated. The number of
   countries experiencing violent conflict is the highest it has been in
   the last 30 years. The result is that more than 30 million children
   have been displaced by conflict. Many of them are being enslaved,
   trafficked, abused and exploited. Many more are living in limbo,
   without official immigration status or access to education and health
   care. From Afghanistan to Mali, to South Sudan, Yemen and beyond,
   warring parties are flouting one of the most basic rules of war: the
   protection of children.

     Children have become frontline targets. This is a moral crisis of
     our age: We must never accept this as the ‘new normal.’

   To better monitor, prevent, and end attacks against children, the
   United Nations Security Council has identified and condemned six grave
   violations against children in times of war: Killing and maiming of
   children; recruitment or use of children in armed forces and armed
   groups; attacks on schools or hospitals; rape or other grave sexual
   violence; abduction of children; and denial of humanitarian access for
   children. 

   Between 2005 and 2022, more than 315,000 grave violations were verified
   against children, committed by parties to conflict in more than 30
   conflict situations across Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin
   America. The actual number is undoubtedly far higher. 

Stop attacks on children

   Ultimately children need peace to thrive. It is critical for children
   that efforts to end today’s seemingly endless armed conflicts are
   redoubled. But children cannot wait for protection – while wars
   continue, we must never accept attacks against children.

   More than 30 years since the adoption of the Convention on the Rights
   of the Child, and more than 70 years since the four Geneva Conventions
   – the international legal bedrock to protect civilians in war – it is
   time to say “Enough! Stop attacks on children.”
   Read the change agenda

What we can all do to make change happen

   Citizens everywhere can begin by not averting their gaze from
   children’s suffering, because it seems too distant or the politics of
   conflict too complex.

   We must insist to national and international leaders that protecting
   children during armed conflict is the cornerstone of our shared
   humanity.

   We must demand leadership which is prepared to act to prevent attacks
   and violence against children trapped in war zones.

   Governments and all warring parties where conflicts rage must act to
   fulfil their obligations to protect children and enable access to
   specialized response services for children affected by violence.

   Communities in conflict-affected areas must be supported to create
   protective environments for girls and boys.

   Governments who support or who have influence over warring parties must
   use all their influence to insist children are protected according to
   the requirements of international law.

   International peace and security institutions such as the United
   Nations Security Council and regional organizations can do more to
   prioritize the safety and well-being of children trapped in armed
   conflicts.

   The international community can do more to support programmes which
   work to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation, and
   deliver the services needed to help children come through conflict with
   hope for a better future.

   By protecting children from attacks in armed conflict, we keep hope
   alive, we begin to prepare children to shape peaceful futures for
   themselves and their countries. Acting together, we can turn back this
   deadly ‘new normal’ of attacks against children and preserve humanity.

   Children cannot wait. We must act now.

Protecting children from explosive weapons in populated areas

   In conflicts around the world, civilians continue to endure the
   devastating consequences of the use of explosive weapons in populated
   areas (EWIPA). When used in cities, towns and villages, these weapons
   often have effects well beyond their targets. They claim countless
   lives and limbs, cause widespread destruction, and deprive people of
   essential civilian services, such as water and sanitation, electricity,
   health care and education.

   On 18 November 2022, a new political declaration was launched:
   “Strengthening the Protection of Civilians from the Humanitarian
   Consequences Arising from the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated
   Areas.” The declaration, which had been signed by 80 states by 19
   November 2022, sends a strong signal worldwide that harming civilians
   and damaging cities is not a reality we should accept by committing
   signatory States to restrict or refrain from the use of explosive
   weapons in populated areas.

Emergency funding appeal for children

   Today, there are more children in need of humanitarian assistance than
   at any other time since the Second World War. Across the globe,
   children are facing a historic confluence of crises – from conflict and
   displacement to infectious disease outbreaks and soaring rates of
   malnutrition.

   More than 400 million children live in areas under conflict; an
   estimated 1 billion children – nearly half the world’s children – live
   in countries at extreme vulnerability to the impacts of climate change;
   at least 36.5 million children have been displaced from their homes;
   and 8 million children under age 5 across 15 crisis-hit countries are
   at risk of death from severe wasting.

   But the situation is far from hopeless. We know how to reach children
   at greatest risk and in greatest need. Decisive and timely humanitarian
   action can save children’s lives, while also sowing the seeds of future
   development.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Through the Humanitarian Action for Children appeal 2023, UNICEF is
   appealing for US$10.3 billion to reach more than 110 million children
   with humanitarian assistance.

Humanitarian action for children: Goals for 2023

   In 2023, UNICEF and its partners will continue to provide a principled,
   timely, predictable and efficient humanitarian response in line with
   international norms and standards. UNICEF is also working on
   strengthening the resilience of communities and health infrastructure
   to withstand climate hazards, with the aim of better linking its
   humanitarian response to longer-term community resilience and climate
   adaptation.

   Gender equality and inclusive programming: In 2023, UNICEF will
   continue to prioritize gender equity in humanitarian action – from
   preparedness to response and recovery.

   Climate in humanitarian action: While much of the global focus is on
   mitigating climate change risk, investment in adaptation measures is
   required immediately to build resilience in a drastically – and rapidly
   – changing environment. UNICEF’s interventions focus on: (1) scaling up
   climate change adaptation models in global operations; (2) advocating
   and engaging in policy development; and (3) prioritizing
   climate-adaptive preparedness efforts as key elements to ensure timely,
   effective and cost-efficient actions to save lives and build
   resilience.

   Global food and nutrition crises: UNICEF’s goal is to protect and
   promote diets, services and practices that prevent, detect and treat
   child wasting. UNICEF aims to ensure that no child dies from wasting.
   UNICEF will accelerate progress on two interrelated fronts
   simultaneously: (1) reduce the number of children suffering from the
   more severe forms of wasting; (2) increase the number of children with
   severe forms of wasting who access treatment. 👉🏼 Learn more about
   severe wasting

   Public health emergencies: The annual number of outbreaks reported to
   the World Health Organization has increased more than threefold since
   1980. UNICEF is committed to addressing public health emergencies not
   only through emergency coordination and leadership, responding to the
   health threat, but also by working to ensure the continuity of
   essential services.
