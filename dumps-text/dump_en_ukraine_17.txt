 Russian losses in Ukraine have wiped out its advantage in Baltics, report says

   STUTTGART, Germany — Russia’s battlefield losses in Ukraine have
   eliminated the military advantages it once held over NATO allies in the
   Baltic region, a new think tank report says.

   “Russia has effectively lost its position of power and the capacity to
   threaten its neighbors with projections of military power,” Pavel Baev
   wrote in a November report for the French Institute of International
   Relations.

   Baev, a longtime Russia expert who once worked at a research institute
   inside the Soviet Union’s defense ministry, argues many Western policy
   planners haven’t grasped the long-term implications of what the war in
   Ukraine means for security in the Baltics.

   While some in the West see Russia’s weakened position as transitional and
   a Russian comeback inevitable, Moscow sees the loss of its conventional
   military edge in the Baltics as “both unacceptable and irreversible,” Baev
   said.

   The Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were annexed by the
   Soviet Union during World War II. Since becoming independent in the 1990s,
   their forces always have been far smaller and less developed than
   Russia’s.

   However, they have welcomed training with U.S. troops and other NATO
   allies, which are required to collectively defend the Baltic nations if
   they are attacked, in line with the alliance’s treaty.

   battlegroups in the Baltics and Poland, and ramped up rotations of other
   combat forces in the region.

   Russia’s war in Ukraine has taken an extreme toll on its military and
   challenges its ability to maintain a large force on its western flank with
   NATO, the report said. The study argues that Moscow’s strategic goal of
   turning its military exclave of Kaliningrad into a launching pad to
   dominate the central part of the Baltic region “has effectively been
   canceled.”

   Moreover, Ukraine’s ability to target Russian military infrastructure
   around Crimea has exposed weaknesses in Russia’s coastal defense weapon
   systems. Those vulnerabilities also apply to the Russian military along
   the Baltic coast.

   Beyond the tactical weaknesses, Russian capabilities were compromised as
   assets moved to the war front. Many of the Baltic units tasked with
   guarding Russia’s western border with NATO countries have been decimated
   during the nearly two years of fighting in Ukraine, according to the
   report, which cites a lengthy list of damaged units.

   “Whatever the scope of the outcome of the war, Russia will not be able to
   rebuild a position of military superiority in the Baltic theater or even
   to set an approximate balance of forces with NATO, which is implementing a
   new plan to strengthen its posture in this reconfigured direction,” Baev
   said.

   Moscow could be forced to rely more on long-range missiles and talk up its
   nuclear capability for deterrence purposes, to make up for its
   conventional military disadvantages.

   “Plain strategic logic dictates that weakness of conventional forces
   necessitates greater reliance on nuclear capabilities, and the Baltic
   theater may see applications of this logic,” the report says.

   Regardless of the outcome of the war, Russia also will need to position
   forces along its southern border with Ukraine for the long-haul, the
   report says.

   For years, the Baltics have been a focal point for the American-led NATO
   alliance, which has strengthened its position in the region amid concerns
   that it was outgunned by Russia. Many of the alliance’s changes were
   prompted by Russia’s initial 2014 intervention in Ukraine, which shattered
   old post-Cold War assumptions about a more secure Europe.

   In the years before 2014, many NATO militaries drastically reduced defense
   spending, shrunk the sizes of their militaries and regarded the prospect
   of large-scale conflict on the European continent as an anachronism.

   The U.S. military also sharply scaled back on the Continent, removing the
   last of its battle tanks from Europe just months before Russia’s
   annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula.

   The diminished NATO force prompted angst among security analysts at the
   time. Those concerns were reinforced by a large war game, carried out by
   the Rand Corp. think tank with the assistance of numerous American
   military commands between 2014 and 2015.

   It found a Russian offensive in the Baltics would overwhelm lesser-armed
   alliance forces and seize the Estonian and Latvian capitals in a matter of
   hours.

   The Rand war game, which garnered much attention at the time, said “the
   outcome was, bluntly, a disaster for NATO.”

   Since then, NATO has added multinational battlegroups in the Baltics and
   Poland and ramped up rotations of other combat forces in the region,
   including U.S. Army tank units.

   That, along with the addition of Finland into NATO and eventually Sweden,
   tipped the balance in the Baltics to NATO’s favor, Baev said.

   “With the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO, the Baltic theater is
   reconfigured so profoundly to Russia’s disadvantage that no amount of
   effort could make ‘Fortress Kaliningrad’ defensible,” the report said.
