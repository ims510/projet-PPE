The war years and post-World War II trends

Decline of the Hollywood studios

   During the U.S. involvement in World War II, the Hollywood film
   industry cooperated closely with the government to support its war-aims
   information campaign. Following the declaration of war on Japan, the
   government created a Bureau of Motion Picture Affairs to coordinate the
   production of entertainment features with patriotic, morale-boosting
   themes and messages about the “American way of life,” the nature of the
   enemy and the allies, civilian responsibility on the home front, and
   the fighting forces themselves. Initially unsophisticated vehicles for
   xenophobia and jingoism with titles such as The Devil with Hitler and
   Blondie for Victory (both 1942), Hollywood’s wartime films became
   increasingly serious as the war dragged on (Fritz Lang’s Hangmen Also
   Die, Jean Renoir’s This Land Is Mine, Tay Garnett’s Bataan, all 1943;
   Delmer Daves’s Destination Tokyo, Alfred Hitchcock’s Lifeboat, Lewis
   Milestone’s The Purple Heart, all 1944; Milestone’s A Walk in the Sun,
   1946). In addition to commercial features, several Hollywood directors
   produced documentaries for government and military agencies. Among the
   best-known of these films, which were designed to explain the war to
   both servicemen and civilians, are Frank Capra’s seven-part series Why
   We Fight (1942–44), John Ford’s The Battle of Midway (1942), William
   Wyler’s The Memphis Belle (1944), and John Huston’s The Battle of San
   Pietro (1944). The last three were shot on location and were made
   especially effective by their immediacy.

   When World War II ended, the American film industry seemed to be in an
   ideal position. Full-scale mobilization had ended the Depression
   domestically, and victory had opened vast, unchallenged markets in the
   war-torn economies of western Europe and Japan. Furthermore, from 1942
   through 1945, Hollywood had experienced the most stable and lucrative
   three years in its history, and in 1946, when two-thirds of the
   American population went to the movies at least once a week, the
   studios earned record-breaking profits. The euphoria ended quickly,
   however, as inflation and labour unrest boosted domestic production
   costs and as important foreign markets, including Britain and Italy,
   were temporarily lost to protectionist quotas. The industry was more
   severely weakened in 1948, when a federal antitrust suit against the
   five major and three minor studios ended in the “Paramount decrees,”
   which forced the studios to divest themselves of their theatre chains
   and mandated competition in the exhibition sector for the first time in
   30 years. Finally, the advent of network television broadcasting in the
   1940s provided Hollywood with its first real competition for American
   leisure time by offering consumers “movies in the home.”

   The American film industry’s various problems and the nation’s general
   postwar disillusionment generated several new film types in the late
   1940s. Although the studios continued to produce traditional genre
   films, such as westerns and musicals, their financial difficulties
   encouraged them to make realistic small-scale dramas rather than
   fantastic lavish epics. Instead of depending on spectacle and special
   effects to create excitement, the new lower-budget films tried to
   develop thought-provoking or perverse stories reflecting the
   psychological and social problems besetting returning war veterans and
   others adapting to postwar life. Some of the American cinema’s grimmest
   and most naturalistic films were produced during this period, including
   those of the so-called social consciousness cycle, which attempted to
   deal realistically with such endemic problems as racism (Elia Kazan’s
   Gentleman’s Agreement, 1947; Alfred Werker’s Lost Boundaries, 1949),
   alcoholism (Stuart Heisler’s Smash-Up, 1947), and mental illness
   (Anatole Litvak’s The Snake Pit, 1948); the semidocumentary melodrama,
   which reconstructed true criminal cases and was often shot on location
   (Kazan’s Boomerang, 1947; Henry Hathaway’s Kiss of Death, 1947); and
   the film noir, whose dark, fatalistic interpretations of contemporary
   American reality are unique in the industry’s history (Tay Garnett’s
   The Postman Always Rings Twice, 1946; Orson Welles’s The Lady from
   Shanghai, 1947; Jacques Tourneur’s Out of the Past, 1947; Abraham
   Polonsky’s Force of Evil, 1948).

   Film content was next influenced strongly by the fear of communism that
   pervaded the United States during the late 1940s and early ’50s.
   Anticommunist “witch-hunts” began in Hollywood in 1947 when the House
   Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) decided to investigate
   communist influence in movies. More than 100 witnesses, including many
   of Hollywood’s most talented and popular artists, were called before
   the committee to answer questions about their own and their associates’
   alleged communist affiliations. On November 24, 1947, a group of eight
   screenwriters and two directors, later known as the Hollywood Ten, were
   sentenced to serve up to a year in prison for refusing to testify. That
   evening the members of the Association of Motion Picture Producers,
   which included the leading studio heads, published what became known as
   the Waldorf Declaration, in which they fired the members of the
   Hollywood Ten and expressed their support of HUAC. The studios, afraid
   to antagonize already shrinking audiences, then initiated an unofficial
   policy of blacklisting, refusing to employ any person even suspected of
   having communist associations. Hundreds of people were fired from the
   industry, and many creative artists were never able to work in
   Hollywood again. Throughout the blacklisting era, filmmakers refrained
   from making any but the most conservative motion pictures;
   controversial topics or new ideas were carefully avoided. The resulting
   creative stagnation, combined with financial difficulties, contributed
   significantly to the demise of the studio system, although,
   paradoxically, the actions that the studios took between 1952 and 1965,
   including the practice of blacklisting, can be viewed as an attempt to
   halt the industry’s decline.
