Israel-Hamas war: North Korea's bloody fingerprints are over October 7 - opinion

North Korea has shown itself to be nothing less than an enemy of Israel. It has
close ties with Iran and Syria and has backed Hamas and Hezbollah.

   In the seven weeks since Hamas invaded Israel and massacred over 1,200
   people, growing international attention has been directed toward the
   terrorist organization’s primary backers and paymasters, chief among them
   Iran and Qatar.

   The two autocratic regimes, which have provided Hamas with various forms
   of support over the course of many years, both bear responsibility for the
   savagery that was inflicted by their Gaza-based client. Largely
   overlooked, however, has been the role of yet another nefarious
   dictatorship, one that also deserves to be held to account for the part
   that it played in the largest mass murder of Jews since the Holocaust. 

   While its capital city of Pyongyang may be 8,000 kilometers away, the
   North Korean regime’s bloody fingerprints are in fact all over the October
   7 Hamas atrocities. And Kim Jong Un’s evil Stalinist state must not go
   unpunished for the chaos that it helped to unleash. Although North Korea’s
   state-run news agency has vehemently denied any involvement, the facts on
   the ground indicate otherwise.

  How did North Korea help Hamas carry out the October 7 massacre against
  Israel?

   To begin with, Hamas used weapons that were made in the Hermit Kingdom. 

   On October 19, the Associated Press (AP) reported, based on information
   provided by South Korean officials, two experts on North Korean arms, as
   well as the AP’s own analysis of weapons captured by Israel on the
   battlefield, that Hamas was using Pyongyang’s F-7 rocket-propelled
   grenade, or RPGs. North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un and Russia's Defence

   “North Korea has long supported Palestinian militant [terrorist] groups,
   and North Korean arms have previously been documented amongst interdicted
   supplies,” arms expert N.R. Jenzen-Jones told AP.

   He further added, based on video imagery of the October 7 assault, that
   the terrorist group was employing North Korea’s Type 58 self-loading
   rifle, a variant of the Kalashnikov assault rifle. In other words, it is
   highly likely that at least some of the Israelis who were murdered by
   Hamas died at the hands of weapons provided by North Korea. Indeed, on
   October 26, Agence France-Presse quoted an Israeli military official as
   saying that 10% of the weapons used by Hamas in the attacks had originated
   in North Korea. South Korean military and intelligence sources concur.

   On October 17, a senior official from South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff
   was quoted by UPI as saying, “Hamas is believed to be directly or
   indirectly linked to North Korea in various areas, such as the weapons
   trade, tactical guidance, and training.”

   “The official also noted,” the report said, “that North Korean-made
   122-mm. multiple rocket launchers were provided to an armed group related
   to Hamas, and artillery shells marked ‘Bang-122’ – the same as ammunition
   used by North Korea – were found on the Israel-Gaza border.”

   In addition to providing Hamas with the means to murder, Pyongyang may
   also have assisted with the know-how.

   Back in December 2016, Kim Jong Un publicly presided over a military
   training exercise of North Korean paragliders simulating an assault on the
   South Korean presidential residence in Seoul. And that tactic is precisely
   what Hamas utilized as part of its coordinated attack on Israel on October
   7.

   “There is a possibility that this know-how was passed on to Hamas,” the
   South Korean official told UPI. His remarks were later confirmed by the
   South Korean Defense Ministry.

   THE RELATIONSHIP between Hamas and North Korea is actually not new and
   stretches back for years.

   Nearly a decade ago, on July 26, 2014, the UK Daily Telegraph reported
   that Hamas had made a down payment to Pyongyang to acquire missiles and
   communications equipment as part of a larger arms deal. The paper noted
   that “Hamas has forged close links with North Korea, which is keen to
   support groups that are opposed to Western interests in the region.” It
   also cited unnamed Israeli military commanders as saying that North Korean
   experts had been advising Hamas on how to build its network of underground
   terror tunnels based on those that Pyongyang constructed decades ago
   beneath the demilitarized zone with South Korea.

   Prior to that, in 2009, a shipment from North Korea of 35 tons of military
   materiel, which included rockets, was seized in Thailand. It was later
   revealed that it had been intended for delivery to Iran, which was
   planning to smuggle the weapons to Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

   And last month, in an article on the 38 North website, a publication of
   the Stimson Center, Dr. Samuel Ramani highlighted the history of “North
   Korea’s covert alliance with Iran-aligned militias in the Middle East.”

   These ties stretch back to the 1970s when Pyongyang provided weapons to
   Yasser Arafat and training to other Palestinian terrorist groups.

   By any measure, North Korea has shown itself to be nothing less than an
   enemy of Israel. It has close ties with Iran and Syria, has backed Hamas
   and Hezbollah, and provided arms and know-how to those who seek to destroy
   the Jewish state.

   Kim Jong Un may be pudgy and puerile, but he is perilous too. It is
   therefore essential that Israel take a more forceful public stand against
   North Korea and continue to strengthen relations with South Korea, which
   can serve as an important partner in trying to contain Pyongyang’s Middle
   Eastern mischief.

   And we must raise greater awareness about North Korea’s support for groups
   such as Hamas, which underlines how Kim’s regime is a force for
   instability not only in the Far East but around the globe.

   Simply put, North Korea has Jewish blood on its hands. It cannot be
   allowed to act with impunity. 
