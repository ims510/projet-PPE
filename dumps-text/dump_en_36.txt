   A man from the Siberian region of Buryatia was sentenced to five years
   in prison after it turned out that he attempted to avoid returning to
   the war in Ukraine by acquiring a false death certificate, RFE/RL has
   learned. Zorigto Arabzhayev was mobilized and sent to Ukraine in
   November 2022 and returned on leave in the spring. When military
   officials came to his home after he failed to return to his unit, his
   son told them he had died and showed them a death certificate that
   turned out to be fake upon further investigation. Arabzhayev was
   subsequently arrested. To read the original story by RFE/RL's

   The commander in chief of the Swedish armed forces, General Micael
   Byden, has visited the front in eastern Ukraine, according to Ukrainian
   media reports. He inspected positions of the 45th Independent Artillery
   Brigade and spoke with soldiers, according to a video of the unit
   shared by Ukrainian media on December 10. The brigade was equipped with
   Swedish Archer mobile artillery pieces in the autumn. Byden promised
   the Ukrainians further support. Sweden has traditionally followed a
   policy of neutrality, but following Russia's full-scale invasion of
   Ukraine in February 2022, the country changed course and is now seeking
   to join the NATO alliance.

   EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has demanded Iran immediately
   release Swedish EU employee Johan Floderus, who is facing trial in
   Tehran on charges of spying for Israel, accusations the bloc and his
   family have vehemently denied. Floderus was detained in April 2022
   while visiting Iran, his family said. Borrell on December 10 said that
   "there are absolutely no grounds for keeping Johan Floderus in
   detention." Sweden's foreign minister said Floderus's trial began on
   December 9. Floderus works for the EU's diplomatic service responsible
   for Afghanistan, but it wasn't immediately clear if he holds diplomatic
   status. To read the original story by RFE/RL's Radio Farda, click here.

Mohammadi Blasts Iran's 'Despotic' Regime In Smuggled Nobel Acceptance Speech

   Peace Prize on her behalf in Oslo on December 10.

   The teenage children of imprisoned Iranian human rights activist Narges
   Mohammadi accepted the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize for their mother at a
   ceremony in Oslo on December 10, delivering a speech in which she
   blasted the "despotic" regime in Tehran.

   Twins Ali and Kiana, 17, who have lived in exile in France the past
   eight years, read the speech their mother had managed to smuggle out of
   Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, where she has been held since 2021.

   The Nobel Committee released a video of the twins' acceptance of the
   award.

   Renowned globally as a staunch advocate for the Women, Life, Freedom
   movement, Mohammadi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on October 6.

   The Nobel awards are each endowed with 11 million Swedish kronors (just
   more than $1 million).

   For years, Mohammadi has voiced dissent against the obligatory hijab
   rule imposed on Iranian women, as well as restrictions on women's
   freedoms and rights in the country by its Islamic regime.

   In the speech read by her children -- who were standing next to an
   empty chair -- Mohammadi said, "I write this message from behind the
   high, cold walls of a prison."

   "I am an Iranian woman, a proud and honorable contributor to
   civilization, who is currently under the oppression of a despotic
   religious government," she said.

   "I am a woman prisoner who, in enduring deep and soul-crushing
   suffering resulting from the lack of freedom, equality, and democracy,
   has recognized the necessity of her existence and has found faith."

   Her message stated that "the Islamic republic regime is at the lowest
   level of popular legitimacy and this government has responded to
   people's demands by suppression, execution, slaughter, and
   imprisonment."

   Iskar in Bulgaria to the Serbian city of Nis, allowing Belgrade to
   access gas from Azerbaijan and the LNG terminal in the Greek port of
   Alexandroupolis. The capacity of the pipeline on the Serbian side is
   1.8 billion cubic meters a year, which accounts for 60 percent of the
   country's annual gas needs.

   10. Regular flights would be another step toward restoring ties between
   the two Middle Eastern rivals. A Chinese-mediated agreement in March
   restored diplomatic relations after years of tensions that threatened
   the security of the entire region and fuelled conflicts in Iraq, Syria,

Russian Activists Protest Crackdown On Journalists, Including RFE/RL's
Detained Kurmasheva

   on December 10.

   KAZAN, Russia -- Activists on December 10 protested against the
   crackdown inside Russia on independent journalists, including Alsu
   Kurmasheva, a veteran journalist of RFE/RL's Tatar-Bashkir Service who
   has been held in Russian custody since October 18.

   Protesters in Kazan held placards including, "Alsu Kurmasheva is a
   journalist, not a criminal," and "No one should die for the right to
   tell the truth," before security forces moved in and removed any signs
   mentioning the detained RFE/RL journalist.

   Kurmasheva, a Prague, Czech Republic-based journalist with RFE/RL who
   holds dual U.S. and Russian citizenship, traveled to Russia for a
   family emergency in May.

   She was temporarily detained while waiting for her return flight on
   June 2 at the airport in Kazan, the capital of the Tatarstan region,
   where both of her passports were confiscated. She was not able to leave
   Russia as she awaited the return of her travel documents.

   Kurmasheva was fined 10,000 rubles ($103) on October 11 for failing to
   register her U.S. passport with the Russian authorities, according to
   local media reports based on court documents they'd seen.

   Kurmasheva was detained again on October 18 and this time charged with
   failing to register as a foreign agent, a crime that carries a maximum
   sentence of five years in prison.

   The Investigative Committee said Kurmasheva was being charged under a
   section of the Criminal Code that refers to the registration of
   "foreign agents" who carry out the "purposeful collection of
   information in the field of military, military-technical activities of
   Russia," which, if received by foreign sources, "can be used against
   the security of the country."
   RFE/RL's Alsu Kurmasheva sits in a cage in a courtroom in Kazan,
   Russia, on October 20. The court ordered her held in custody until at
   least December 5. RFE/RL's Alsu Kurmasheva sits in a cage in a

   fine her 10,000 rubles for "failure to inform Russian officials about
   holding a second citizenship."

   Rights Day and the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
   Human Rights. Since seizing power in 2021, the Taliban has erased basic
   rights and freedoms, with women and girls deeply affected. They are
   excluded from most public spaces and daily life, and the restrictions
   have sparked global condemnation. The UN mission, highlighting the
   Taliban's failures in upholding its rights obligations, said it
   continues to document extrajudicial killings, torture and
   ill-treatment, corporal punishment, arbitrary arrest and detention, and
   other violations of detainees' rights.

Ukraine's Zelenskiy Heads To Argentina To Drum Up Global South Support In War
With Russia

   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has made a stopover visit to
   Cape Verde on his way to Argentina, where he is due to attend the
   inauguration of new Argentinian President Javier Milei, his first trip
   to Latin America and his latest bid to shore up support in the Global
   South for Kyiv in its 21-month-old war against Russia.

   Zelenskiy met on December 9 with Cape Verde Prime Minister Ulisses
   Correia e Silva in what he later called in a social-media post the
   "first meeting of leaders in the history of our bilateral relations."

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine

   RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on
   Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military
   aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's
   coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.

   Zelenskiy thanked Cape Verde for condemning Russia's full-scale
   invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and its backing of Ukrainian initiatives.

   Zelenskiy is hoping to convene a "global peace summit" and has promoted
   a peace plan rooted in the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine
   and recognition of its post-Soviet borders of 1991.

   Analysts say Kyiv has been trying to build ties with African, Asian,
   and Latin American governments, but has found its support for Israel at
   odds with the positions of some of those countries.

   In Cape Verde, Zelenskiy informed the African leader of efforts to
   develop new grain routes as well as plans to create grain centers in
   Africa, a statement from Zelenskiy's office said.

   In July, Russia refused to extend a UN-backed deal that had allowed
   Ukraine to export grain and other food items from three designated
   Black Sea ports. Much of those agricultural exports were destined for
   parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.

   After pulling out of the agreement brokered by the UN and Turkey,
   Russia has attacked Ukraine's Black Sea ports and grain infrastructure,
   destroying almost 300,000 metric tons of grain, according to a recent
   estimate by the British government.

   An alternative, temporary Black Sea corridor has allowed Ukraine to
   ship more than 7 million tons of cargo through Black Sea ports despite
   Russia's blockade, Ukrainian officials said on December 4.

   Meanwhile, while in Argentina for Milei's inauguration, Ukrainian media
   speculated this week that Zelenskiy could meet with Hungarian Prime
   Minister Viktor Orban in a bid to resolve differences over Ukraine's
   bid for European Union membership.

   Earlier this week it was reported that Orban had written European
   Council President Charles Michel to demand that Ukraine's membership be
   taken off the agenda at an EU summit next week.

   That summit in Brussels will decide on whether to start talks with
   Ukraine and neighboring Moldova -- as recommended by the EU Executive
   Commission -- on their bids to join the 27-member bloc. EU leaders will
   also decide on the release of 50 billion euros ($55 billion) in aid for
   Ukraine.

   Orban is considered one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest
   allies in Europe, and his nationalist government has argued against EU
   sanctions on Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Russia Transfers Seized Stake In Strategic Metals Firm To State Nuclear
Energy Company

   Solikamsk, which produces 100 percent of Russia's tantalum and niobium
   as well as 60 percent of its commercial magnesium, was privatized in
   the 1990s.

   (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   Russia has transferred a majority stake in a strategic metals firm to
   the state's nuclear energy company after seizing shares from its
   private owners.

   Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin on December 8 signed an order
   transferring the shares in Solikamsk Magnesium Plant to
   Kremlin-controlled Rosatom, according to аn order posted on the
   government's website.

   Russia last year seized an 89 percent stake in Solikamsk, claiming the
   Urals-based company was illegally privatized in the 1990s.

   Russian courts have nationalized dozens of companies -- many strategic
   -- on that basis since the Kremlin launched its invasion of Ukraine,
   raising fears in the business community about a larger revision of
   privatizations.

   Russia sold off wide swaths of its economy in the 1990s, including
   energy and metals companies, often in an opaque and unfair manner that
   gave rise to the so-called "oligarchs."

   Solikamsk, which produces 100 percent of Russia's tantalum and niobium
   as well as 60 percent of its commercial magnesium, was privatized in
   the 1990s as well.

   Tantalum is used in a variety of commercial and critical defense
   applications such as mobile phones and turbine engines for aircraft,
   while niobium is used in the production of high-strength steel alloys
   used in pipelines and transportation infrastructure.

   Magnesium has a variety of industrial uses, including as a reducing
   agent to separate uranium.

   President Vladimir Putin promised in the early 2000s shortly after
   coming to power that he would not reverse the privatizations if
   Russia's tycoons stayed out of politics and that agreement had largely
   been maintained with a few major exceptions before the war.

   The series of nationalizations -- many but not all based on alleged
   illegal privatization -- since the war began has sent a chill through
   the business community, Aleksandr Shokhin, the head of Russia’s
   industry lobby, told the RBK news agency in September.

   "Nobody knows who will be next," he said.

   He said there was concern the assets are being seized to hand over to
   people who are considered more loyal to the Kremlin.

   "If an asset goes into state ownership, where does it go? Is it
   transferred to the management of the 'right' people, 'good'
   entrepreneurs from some circle? Or is it being put up for
   privatization?" he said.

   Many Russian tycoons have kept a low profile since the invasion of
   Ukraine, with some relocating abroad, opening themselves to criticism,
   especially from pro-war members of the elite.

   Russia earlier this year seized a controlling stake in Syas Pulp and
   Paper Mill, one of the largest manufacturers of toilet paper and
   napkins, after its owner acquired Israeli citizenship and relocated
   abroad.

   Putin last month met with the country's largest businessmen at his
   residence outside Moscow to discuss Russia's business climate. The
   issue of nationalization was expected to be raised.

U.S.-Russian Citizen Arrested For Social-Media Posts

   Since December 2022, desecrating a St. George's ribbon is against the
   law in Russia.

   Russia has arrested a dual U.S.-Russian citizen on charges of
   "rehabilitating Nazism" for two critical posts he made on social media.

   Yury Malyev was arrested on December 8 in St. Petersburg and ordered to
   pretrial detention for two months, the Smolnensky district court said
   in a post on its Telegram channel.

   Malyev last year posted on his Odnoklassniki page an image of the St.
   George ribbon, which represents Russia’s victory over Nazi Germany,
   along with a caption that included the face of a known gay individual
   and profanities, according to the court. It gave no further details.

   On May 8, the day before Russia celebrates its victory over Nazi
   Germany, Malyev posted the image of a dead body with a caption that
   read "how to correctly wear the St. George ribbon."

   The court said the latter post showed "disrespect for society and the
   days of military glory and memorable dates of Russia" and was an
   "insult" to World War II veterans.

   Malyev has "partially" admitted guilt, the court said. He faces up to
   five years in prison if convicted.

   Russian President Vladimir Putin has largely snuffed out freedom of
   expression, clamping down hard on individuals who contest the state's
   official view of World War II as well as the current invasion of
   Ukraine.

   In 2014, Putin outlawed the dissemination of "false information about
   Soviet activities" during World War II and seven years later outlawed
   criticism of veterans of that war.

   In December 2022, he signed into law a bill criminalizing the
   desecration of the St. George ribbon with a punishment of up to five
   years in prison.

   The ribbon dates back to 1769, when Russian Empress Catherine the Great
   established the Order of St. George. The medal was attached to a ribbon
   of black and yellow -- later orange.

   In 1945, the Soviet Union resurrected the orange-and-black ribbon for a
   medal to celebrate victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.

   The colors then became part of annual May 9 Victory Day celebrations in
   the Soviet Union and then in Russia, and they were handed out en masse
   in Russia starting in 2005.

   Nearly a decade later, activists supporting Russia's 2014 seizure of
   Ukraine's Crimea and backing of separatists in eastern Ukraine began
   using the ribbon as a symbol, and it is now widely associated with the
   Russian aggression in Ukraine.

   Ukraine banned the St. George ribbon in 2017.

Russia Seeks To Unfreeze Gold Reserves As It Woos Global South

   Russia has said it is studying whether its gold reserves, frozen by the
   West in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine, could be used to help
   developing countries overcome the impact of climate change.

   In a statement made at the COP28 summit in Dubai, where officials from
   around the world are gathered, Russia's climate envoy suggested the
   frozen funds could be used to help emerging nations accelerate their
   fight against climate change.

   "We are ready to announce that Russia is looking into the voluntary
   contribution of finance to the loss and damage fund from the frozen
   national gold reserves held by international organisations," Ruslan
   Edelgeriyev, Russia's climate representative, said on the main stage at
   COP28.

   Russia has been seeking to strengthen ties with countries in Asia,
   Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East -- sometimes referred to as
   the Global South -- after the West cut most ties with Moscow over its
   brutal invasion of Ukraine.

   Those countries, many of which are in the developing stage, are among
   the hardest hit by climate change. Global South countries have
   criticized developed countries, especially Western states, for slow
   rolling aid to help them combat climate change.

   Global South countries say developed countries have largely caused
   climate change through their greater use of fossil fuels, while they
   suffer the consequences. Developed countries provided about $100
   billion in financing to developing countries for climate change last
   year.

   The United States and Europe have frozen about $300 billion in Russian
   gold reserves held in the West as punishment for its invasion of
   Ukraine.

   Washington and Brussels have yet to decide what they will do with the
   Russian funds. Some Western officials have called for using the funds
   to help rebuild Ukraine after the war.

   Russia's climate representative may have simply attempted to win over
   developing countries while stoking their frustration with the West.

   Many countries in the Global South have criticized the West for quickly
   mobilizing tens of billions of dollars in military and financial aid
   for Ukraine when their calls for help receive marginal attention and
   resources.

   The authorities in Kyiv on December 9 dismantled a massive equestrian
   monument to Bolshevik military commander Mykola Shchors that was
   erected in the Ukrainian capital nearly 70 years ago. Workers spent
   seven hours removing the 7-ton monument, which will be stored in a
   museum. The city administration announced on Telegram that "more than
   60 monuments related to the history and culture of Russia and the
   U.S.S.R. have already been removed from the capital." Shchors was a Red
   Army commander who fought against the short-lived Ukrainian People's
   Republic and was killed in unclear circumstances in August 1919. To

   a fifth presidential term. Party secretary Andrei Turchak said United
   Russia would provide all necessary resources for Putin's campaign.
   Putin on December 8 signaled that he will seek another term in the
   election set for March 15-17. Russian elections are tightly controlled
   by the Kremlin and are neither free nor fair but are viewed by the

Russian Opposition Leader Navalny Missing For Three Days, Life 'At Risk,'
Supporters Say

   Supporters of imprisoned Russian opposition leader Aleksei Navalny say
   they have had no contact with him for three days.

   Maria Pevchikh, chairwoman of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation,
   wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on December 8 that "Navalny is missing
   for three days now."

   "Navalny’s life is at great risk," she wrote. "He is in complete
   isolation now."

   In a post on Instagram on December 8, Ruslan Shaveddinov, also with the
   Anti-Corruption Foundation, wrote that the last information about
   Navalny was that he had fallen ill in his cell after being subjected to
   harsh conditions, including limited food, a lack of ventilation, and
   minimal exercise time.

   "Navalny's only protection is publicity," Shaveddinov wrote.

   Navalny associate Kira Yarmysh wrote on X on December 8 that the
   opposition leader's lawyers had waited outside the prison all day
   without being granted permission to visit their client.

   She said his allies had not received any letters from him for more than
   a week, which she said was unusual.

   "Our letters to him also have not been delivered," she wrote.

   On December 8, Navalny was not connected by video link to a court
   hearing, with prison officials citing technical problems.

   On December 7, Navalny's supporters launched a campaign to oppose
   President Vladimir Putin's bid to secure a fifth presidential term in
   Russia's March 2024 election. Navalny has urged Russians to vote
   against Putin in the election. Putin announced on December 8 that he
   will seek another term.

   Navalny is serving a 19-year prison term after being convicted of
   creating an "extremist" organization, charges that are widely believed
   to be retribution for his political activity. In September, he was
   transferred to a strict-regime cell after being deemed "incorrigible."

   He has been placed in solitary confinement more than 20 times since he
   began his prison term in February 2021.

   He has been recognized as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty
   International and as a political prisoner by the Memorial human rights
   group.

Iran Blocks Amini's Family From Traveling To Accept EU Award

   Mahsa Amini's father, Amjad, prepares for her funeral ceremony in
   September 2022.

   Authorities in Iran have prevented relatives of Mahsa Amini, whose
   September 2022 death in custody sparked nationwide anti-government
   protests, from leaving the country to accept the European Parliament's
   Sakharov Prize.

   Amini's mother, father, and brother were told on December 8 at Tehran's
   Iman Khomeini Airport that they had been barred from travelling abroad.

   Their passports were confiscated, a source who asked not to be
   identified told Radio Farda.

   The family's lawyer, Saleh Nikhbakht, who was accompanying them, was
   apparently allowed to travel.

   The European Parliament on October 19 awarded the 2023 Sakharov Prize
   for Freedom of Thought to Amini and the Women, Life, Freedom movement
   that was sparked by her death.

   "The European Parliament proudly stands with the brave and defiant who
   continue to fight for equality, dignity, and freedom in Iran," European
   Parliament President Roberta Metsola said at the time, adding that they
   award "remembers their struggle and continues to honor all those who
   have paid the ultimate price for liberty."

   The prize, which was set up in 1980 to honor individuals and
   organizations promoting human rights and basic freedoms, includes a
   50,000-euro ($54,000) prize. It will be presented in Strasbourg on
   December 13.

   Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman, died in custody on
   September 16, 2022, shortly after being detained by the so-called
   morality police for allegedly violating the country's strict Islamic
   dress code. Supporters say she was subjected to physical abuse while in
   custody.

   The Iranian authorities launched a brutal crackdown against mass
   demonstrations that were sparked by Amini's death and which became one
   of the most daunting challenges faced by the Islamist government since
   Iran's 1979 revolution.

   In October 2022, Amini's family reported receiving death threats aimed
   at preventing them from participating in the peaceful protests.

   required legislation in accordance with the European Commission's
   recommendations on anti-corruption and national minorities," Zelenskiy
   said on X, formerly Twitter. "We anticipate that EU leaders will
   appropriately recognize Ukraine's efforts, and that the EU will follow
   through on its related promises." An EU summit next week is to consider
   whether to start membership negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova.

Kyiv Expects Delivery Of F-16s 'Soon' As Further U.S. Aid Remains Stalled In
Congress

   Ukraine's defense minister has said his country expects to take
   delivery of advanced F-16 fighter jets "soon," as the Biden
   administration warned the U.S. Congress that failure to support Ukraine
   could mean the United States will have to pay a high price in "national
   treasure and in American blood" in the future.

   In comments on December 8, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov
   stressed that preparations to receive the advanced U.S.-made fighters
   were well under way and that "we will receive them soon."

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine

   RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on
   Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military
   aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's
   coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.

   Kyiv has repeatedly urged its allies to provide the aircraft to counter
   Russia's air supremacy in the parts of Ukraine occupied by Russian
   forces.

   "In the short term, we will receive the F-16s," Umerov said. "In the
   medium term, we have also made more orders for our defense forces. I
   mean the years 2027 to 2030."

   In October, Denmark said it would provide its first batch of F-16s to
   Ukraine "in March or April" of 2024.

   In Washington on December 8, U.S. National Security Council spokesman
   John Kirby urged Republican lawmakers to authorize additional military
   aid for Ukraine, saying the ongoing controversy over the issue was "a
   great gift" to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

   "If you think the cost of supporting Ukraine is high now, think
   about...how high it's going to be in national treasure and in American
   blood if we have to start acting on our Article 5 commitments," he
   said, referring to the part of the NATO Charter that obligates allies
   to come to one another's defense.

   "If [Putin] gets Ukraine, he gets right up against the doorstep of
   NATO," Kirby said. "Helping [Ukraine] win this war is very much in our
   national security interest and in the national security interest of all
   our allies in Europe."

   Republican lawmakers in the United States have been refusing to proceed
   with some $60 billion in increased aid for Ukraine unless Democrats
   agree to increased immigration restrictions on the country's southern
   border.

   Speaking in Berlin on December 9, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said
   his government will continue supporting Ukraine despite its current
   budget woes.

   Putin "should not and must not" expect Germany to reduce aid to
   Ukraine, Scholz said.

   Germany is the second-largest supplier of military aid to Kyiv, after
   the United States, providing main battle tanks, heavy artillery, and
   air-defense systems.

   In an interview with the BBC on December 9, Ukrainian first lady Olena
   Zelenska warned of the danger of "Ukraine fatigue," saying her country
   faced "mortal danger" if the West cut back on support.

   "We really need the help," Zelenska said. "In simple words, we cannot
   get tired of this situation, because if we do, we die. And if the world
   gets tired, they will simply let us die."

   In its daily briefing on December 9, the Ukrainian General Staff
   reported some 95 "combat clashes" along the front line over the
   previous 24 hours. In addition, officials said there had been 28
   missile attacks and 27 air strikes.

   Fighting was heaviest in the Donetsk region around Avdiyivka. Russian
   forces have been attempting for several weeks to encircle the
   industrial city, which has become the latest symbol of Ukrainian
   resistance.

   Radev's veto of plans to send 100 surplus armored personnel carriers to
   Ukraine. Radev said on December 4 that lawmakers needed to assess if
   the vehicles were expendable and sent the plan back to parliament for a

Former Kazakh President's Son-In-Law Resigns As Chairman of KazEnergy
Association

   Timur Kulibaev

   (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   Kazakhstan's KazEnergy group -- an association of almost 60 oil and gas
   companies -- said on December 8 that former Kazakh President Nursultan
   Nazarbaev's son-in-law, Timur Kulibaev, has resigned as chairman of the
   group after leading it since it was established in 2005.

   A KazEnergy statement at its website said the group is now managed by
   Maghzum Myrzaghaliev, who previously served as energy minister, adviser
   to President Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev, and head of the board of the oil
   company Kazmunaigaz.
   Kulibaev, one of the richest people in the world, is married to
   Nazarbaev’s middle daughter, Dinara, with whom he owns the largest bank
   in Kazakhstan and assets in several other businesses. Forbes magazine
   estimates their combined wealth to be more than $8 billion.
   Kulibaev, 57, had already left other prominent executive positions
   since unprecedented anti-government protests turned to mass unrest
   across the oil-rich Central Asian nation, leaving at least 238 people
   dead.
   This includes his departure in February last year from the board of
   directors of Russia's Gazprom energy giant after serving for more than
   10 years and his departure in January from the post of chairman of
   Kazakhstan's National Chamber of Entrepreneurs, Atameken.
   The departures follow a pattern of purges of relatives of Nazarbaev,
   83, who ruled Kazakhstan for almost 30 years but who was widely
   believed to have remained in control behind the scenes after handing
   power to Toqaev in 2019. However, after deadly unrest in 2022,
   Nazarbaev and his inner circle lost influence in the country.
   Two other sons-in-law of Nazarbaev, Qairat Sharipbaev and Dimash
   Dosanov, were pushed out of top jobs at major state energy companies,
   QazaqGaz and KazTransOil, respectively, at the time.
   Several other Nazarbaev relatives also lost top positions in the
   tightly controlled former Soviet republic.
   In September, the Kazakh Prosecutor-General's Office said it had
   launched a probe against Nazarbaev's nephew, Samat Abish, on a charge
   of abuse of office while serving as the first deputy chairman of the
   Committee of National Security (KNB), the post he was dismissed from
   after the deadly mass unrest.
   In September 2022, Nazarbaev's once-powerful nephew Qairat Satybaldy
   was sentenced to six years in prison on corruption charges.
   The protests in January 2022 were violently dispersed by police and
   military personnel, including troops of the Russia-led Collective
   Security Treaty Organization that Toqaev invited into the country
   claiming that "20,000 extremists who were trained in terrorist camps
   abroad" attacked Almaty.
   The authorities have provided no evidence proving Toqaev’s claim about
   foreign terrorists.

Facing An Uncertain Future, Afghan Girls Finishing Sixth Grade Leave School
In Tears

   The ultra-fundamentalist Islamist Taliban rulers have since banned
   girls from attending school from grade seven onward.

   girls from attending school from grade seven onward.

   Hundreds of thousands of sixth-grade girls in Afghanistan attended the
   last day of the school year, many with tears in their eyes as they face
   an uncertain future because of Taliban policies that forbid them from
   further schooling and restrict their basic human rights.

   "These last few days of our studies are very stressful and difficult,”
   Kainat, a sixth-grader in Kabul, told RFE/RL’s Radio Azadi on December
   8, the last day of the current school year before the winter break. "We
   all cried because none of us will be able to study further. Our
   teachers tried to console us by saying that school doors might reopen
   for us some day.”
   But for Kainat and the rest of the war-torn country's females, that day
   may not come for some time.
   Despite pledges of a less-authoritarian rule than in their previous
   time in power, Taliban militants have sharply restricted the rights and
   freedoms of Afghan girls and women since taking over the government as
   international troops withdrew following two decades of intervention.
   The ultra-fundamentalist Islamist Taliban rulers have since banned
   girls from attending school from grade seven onward. They have severely
   curtailed their employment prospects, mobility, and any public role in
   society, defying international pressure, domestic protests, and efforts
   to persuade the militants from rescinding their brutal policies.
   The ban on education was prompted by the religious views of the Taliban
   Chief Justice Abdul Hakim Haqqani and endorsed by the group's supreme
   leader, Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada.
   Fatima Siddiq, a primary school teacher in Kabul, told Radio Azadi that
   the hopelessness felt by girls as they leave the school is haunting.
   “I am also a mother of three daughters who will no longer be able to
   continue their education,” she said. “How is it possible that the
   [Taliban] government is unable to fulfill its promise of reopening
   schools?”
   The Taliban's policies are deeply unpopular among most Afghans. Even
   though dissent is often met with a harsh response by authorities, some
   people are still willing to criticize the government because the
   policies are seen as destructive.
   In the Muslim nation of some 40 million people, activists and rights
   advocates accuse the Taliban of implementing "gender apartheid" by
   denying women education, work, freedom of movement, and deciding how
   they can appear in public.
   But it's not only females who are bearing the brunt of the government's
   policies.
   In a new report released on December 6, the global rights watchdog
   Human Rights Watch (HRW) said that education for boys in Afghanistan
   under the Taliban rule is at risk, too.

   The report, titled Schools Are Failing Boys Too, says curriculum
   changes, the firing of female teachers, corporal punishment, and other
   practices risk their education over the longer term as well.
   Sahar Fetrat, a women’s rights researcher at HRW and the author of the
   report, says the Taliban has caused “irreversible damage” to the
   education of both Afghan boys and girls.
   “By harming the whole school system in the country, they risk creating
   a lost generation deprived of a quality education,” she said.

   A court in the southeastern Belarusian city of Homel on December 7

   Odnoklassniki social networks, as well as the TikTok accounts of
   RFE/RL's Russian and Ukrainian services. Svaboda's website has been
