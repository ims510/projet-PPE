   A man from the Siberian region of Buryatia was sentenced to five years
   in prison after it turned out that he attempted to avoid returning to
   the war in Ukraine by acquiring a false death certificate, RFE/RL has
   learned. Zorigto Arabzhayev was mobilized and sent to Ukraine in
   November 2022 and returned on leave in the spring. When military
   officials came to his home after he failed to return to his unit, his
   son told them he had died and showed them a death certificate that
   turned out to be fake upon further investigation. Arabzhayev was
   subsequently arrested. To read the original story by RFE/RL's

   Pakistani troops have shot dead eight suspected Islamist militants
   during a firefight in the South Waziristan district of the northwestern
   Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region, the military said in a press release on
   November 27. The statement did not say what group the alleged the

   as Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have been active in the area.
   Islamabad has accused Afghanistan's Taliban rulers of allowing TTP
   militants to use Afghan territory to launch cross-border attacks. The
   Taliban has denied the accusation. To read the original story by

   Unidentified persons wrote pro-Palestinian slogans on the walls of a
   synagogue in Uzbekistan's capital, Tashkent, the AZfront Telegram
   channel reported on November 27. The slogans appeared despite the
   authorities' claim that security has been stepped up around synagogues
   amid a warning by Israel about a possible increase in anti-Semitic
   incidents in Uzbekistan amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Late last
   month, two members of the international religious Jewish movement
   Chabad were attacked in Tashkent. The incident went unreported in
   Uzbekistan, a tightly controlled, mainly Muslim Central Asian country.

Hundreds Of Thousands Left In Dark, Cold As Massive Storms Hit Southeastern
Europe

   Heavy snowstorms in Moldova have severely disrupted traffic in the
   country.

   Blizzards, snowfall, and high winds have wreaked havoc over the past
   two days in eastern and southeastern Europe, leaving hundreds of
   thousands of people isolated and without electricity and running water,
   while traffic accidents prompted by the dangerous conditions have
   caused at least two deaths and several injuries.

   A powerful cyclone sweeping from the Black Sea brought snowfall as far
   north as Moscow in what the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia called
   “one of the strongest storms to ever hit at the end of November.”

   Ukraine, Moldova, Bulgaria, and Romania were among the hardest hit
   areas, including the Russia-annexed Crimea peninsula where one person
   died and almost half a million people were left without power after the
   storm in the Black Sea region flooded roads, unrooted trees and downed
   electricity lines.

   The Aquarium Museum in the Russia-annexed city of Sevastopol reported
   that the storm tore through the complex, killing all of the 800 or so
   animals housed in the facility.

   A storm warning remains in effect in Crimea due to wind gusts of up to
   40 meters per second and November 27 was declared a day off, the
   Interfax news agency reported.

   A Russian-installed official in Ukraine's Crimea peninsula said that
   one person had been killed and others injured as severe storms left
   more than half a million people without electricity and heat in the
   region that Moscow illegally annexed in 2014.

   In war-wracked Ukraine, inclement weather added to people's hardships
   caused by Russian strikes on the country's energy infrastructure.

   Heavy snowfall across the whole country prompted the closure of 14
   highways while 16 of Ukraine's 24 regions were experiencing power cuts.
   Especially harsh conditions were reported in the southern regions of
   Odesa and Mykolayiv, where snow drifts as high as two meters hampered
   traffic.

   The Ukrainian Interior Ministry said a total of 2,019 settlements in 16
   regions have been left without electricity, while 1,370 trucks remain
   stranded, and 840 cars had to be towed.

   Authorities in Romania and neighboring Moldova said hundreds of cities
   and villages have been left without electricity and water in the two
   neighboring countries following heavy snowfall and blizzards that
   prompted a severe disruption of road and railway traffic.

   Railway traffic has resumed in southeastern Romania but 21 national
   highways remain closed as of November 27, authorities said, while
   schools in five southeastern counties -- Braila, Galati, Tulcea,
   Calarasi, and Constanta were also closed.

   A total of 22 counties out of 41 and 170 villages and cities in the
   southeast of the country, including Bucharest, were affected by power
   cuts.

   In Moldova, 123,000 people from almost 200 localities were left without
   electricity. One man died when his car veered off the snow-covered road
   and hit a tree on November 26, police said, adding that several other
   traffic accidents had been reported.

   Sixteen Moldovans were injured when the bus they were traveling on
   overturned during a blizzard on a highway in southern Romania, police
   said. Emergency services transported several injured people to the
   hospital.

   In Bulgaria, snowfall and blizzards prompted authorities to declare a
   state of emergency in several areas in the northeast of the country --
   in the Silistra and Razgrad regions, the Valchi dol municipality, the
   Varna region, and the Shumen region.

   Some 1,000 settlements were without electricity, Prime Minister Nikolay
   Denkov said at an emergency government meeting on November 26.

   on November 26 that it had repelled an attack by 24 Ukrainian drones on
   the Tula, Kaluga, and Bryansk, and Moscow regions.

One Killed, 21 Injured In Suicide Attack On Market In Pakistan

   [X]
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   One person was killed and 21 others were injured, including Pakistani
   soldiers, in a suicide attack on November 26 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
   Province in northwestern Pakistan, authorities said.

   The suicide bomber drove a car into security forces in a market in
   Bannu, two officials with the police and intelligence agencies told
   RFE/RL’s Radio Mashaal on the condition of anonymity because they were
   not authorized to speak to the media.

   They said the dead person was a civilian and that 13 soldiers and other
   civilians were among the injured who were taken to the hospital. The
   officials did not provide any other information, and there has been no
   claim of responsibility for the attack.

   The security situation in the province has worsened in recent months
   despite promises by the government and security authorities. There were
   multiple deadly incidents last week, including the killing of a
   Forestry Department employee in North Waziristan on November 23.

   One day earlier two soldiers were killed in a landmine explosion and a
   policeman was killed in an attack on a checkpoint in Khyber
   Pakhtunkhwa, while in South Waziristan on November 22, three civilians,
   including a local leader, were killed and four were injured in a bomb
   blast in Azam Worsk. No one has claimed responsibility for those
   attacks.

   The bombing in Azam Worsk occurred after two soldiers were killed in an
   armed attack on a post in Sar Rogha in South Waziristan. The Tehrik-e
   Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for that attack.

   The Pakistani government and the country's army say that they have
   continued their operations against the militants.

   The army said on November 21 that it had killed three suspected
   militants in an encounter in North Waziristan. The army added that one
   of its soldiers was also killed in the clash.

   Earlier, the army had claimed the killing of 11 suspected militants in
   clashes during operations in Peshawar and Tank in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on
   November 16.

   Pakistan's caretaker prime minister, Anwar ul-Haq Kakar, said on
   November 20 that terrorist attacks inside his country have increased by
   60 percent since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August
   2021. Some 2,300 people have been killed in these attacks.

Pope Francis Reflects On 'Tormented' Ukraine Marking Holodomor Remembrance
Day

   Pope Francis on November 26 called the Holodomor a “lacerating wound”
   that has been made even more painful for Ukraine by the ongoing war.

   Speaking at the Vatican one day after Ukraine's Holodomor Remembrance
   Day, Francis noted that "tormented" Ukraine commemorated "the genocide
   perpetrated by the Soviet regime which, 90 years ago, caused millions
   of people to starve to death.”

   Russia on November 25 launched the largest wave of drone attacks on
   Ukraine since the start of the war as Ukraine commemorated the 1932–33
   famine in Soviet Ukraine under dictator Josef Stalin that killed
   millions.

   Ukraine said its air defenses it shot down 74 out of a total of 75
   drones launched by Russia, with Kyiv bearing the brunt of the attack.

   Pope Francis, 86, made the televised remarks from a chapel in the
   Vatican after skipping his weekly Sunday appearance at a window
   overlooking St. Peter’s Square because of what he said was a lung
   inflammation.

   The Vatican said on November 25 that Francis had to cancel all
   appointments due to a "mild flu."

   Francis urged the faithful to continue to pray tirelessly for all
   peoples torn apart by conflicts, saying that “prayer is the force of
   peace that stops the spiral of hatred” and opens unexpected paths of
   reconciliation.

   He also noted the four-day truce between Israel and Hamas, which has
   been designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the
   EU.

   “Let us thank God that there is finally a truce between Israel and
   Palestine, and some hostages have been freed. Let us pray that they
   will all be freed as soon as possible,” he said.

   The pontiff also said he would go later this week to Dubai to address
   the COP28 climate change conference, saying that besides war climate
   change is “another great danger…which puts life on Earth, especially
   for the future generations, at risk.”

   Three of the hostages released on November 26 by Hamas, which has been
   designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the EU,
   are Hungarian citizens, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said
   on Facebook.

   “I can share good news with those who are worried about the Hungarian
   hostages: thanks to the mediation of the Qatar government, new hostages
   were released today from Hamas captivity, two of them children with
   Hungarian citizenship.”

   Hungarian President Katalin Novak said in a post on X, formerly
   Twitter, that the other Hungarian released was a woman. She also
   thanked Qatar for its mediation efforts.

   A hostage who holds Russian citizenship has also been released by
   Hamas. The extremist group announced the release of the hostage on
   November 26, adding that it had taken the action in appreciation of
   Moscow's position.

   Israel and Hamas have agreed to swap 50 hostages held by Hamas for 150
   prisoners in Israeli jails over a four-day truce period.

   White House national-security adviser Jake Sullivan said earlier on
   November 26 that there was "reason to believe" a U.S. hostage would
   also be among those released.

   Russia has reportedly ordered the arrest of the chief spokesman for
   Facebook parent company Meta, accusing him of promoting terrorism. The
   decision against Andy Stone was revealed on November 26 by Russian news
   site Mediazona, which said the Justice Ministry order was made in
   February 2023. Stone, who could not be reached for comment, was
   targeted due to a policy change he announced in March 2022, less than a
   month after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The policy shift
   by Meta allowed some calls for violence against Russian invaders,
   including President Vladimir Putin, to be made on Facebook or
   Instagram, which Meta also owns. To read the original story by Current

   Russian officials said Ukraine targeted Moscow and other Russian cities

   antiaircraft systems.

   aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's
   coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.

   Ukraine, meanwhile, reported being targeted by at least nine Russian
   drones overnight on November 26, one day after Russia launched a
   massive wave of drones against Kyiv and other sites. It was the biggest
   such attack since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February
   2022.

   The Russian Defense Ministry reported at least 24 Ukrainian drones that
   it claimed were downed over Tula, Kaluga, and Bryansk, as well as the
   Russian capital. No major damage was reported in any of the locations.

   "A mass drone attack was attempted overnight," Moscow Mayor Sergei
   Sobyanin said in a post to Telegram.

   Andrei Vorobyov, governor of the Moscow region, wrote on Telegram that
   three unspecified buildings were damaged, but there were no injuries.

   In Tula, south of Moscow, one person was wounded when an intercepted
   drone hit an apartment building, regional Governor Aleksei Dyumin said,
   also in a Telegram post.

   As of the afternoon of November 26, Ukrainian officials had made no
   immediate comment on the reported attacks.

   The Russian Army also said it had downed two Ukrainian missiles over
   the Azov Sea that it said were headed for Russia. Russia controls the
   Ukrainian Azov Sea coast, which fell to Moscow early in its offensive
   last year.

   Local authorities in the affected regions did not report casualties.

   Ukraine has upped attacks on Russia since launching its
   counteroffensive, aiming to hit regions close to fighting zones as well
   as further inland into Russia, including Moscow.

   Flights were delayed or canceled at several of Moscow’s major airports
   due to the attack, the Kommersant newspaper reported.

   Ukrainian officials made no comment on the reported attacks, which came
   one day after Russia launched its own major drone attack on the
   Ukrainian capital. Ukrainian officials said more than 70 were brought
   down or intercepted by air defenses.

   Ukraine's military said on November 26 that it had shot down eight of
   nine Russian attack drones, which targeted various locations.

   On the battlefield, fighting has focused around the industrial hub of
   Avdiyivka, which appears almost encircled by Russian forces. Its fall
   would be a significant loss for Kyiv.

   Ukraine, meanwhile, reported Russian attacks in the south and east of
   the country, saying the situation remains difficult.

   Roman Mrochko, head of the military administration in the southern city
   of Kherson, said two urban districts were shelled, while regional
   authorities said around a dozen villages were left without electricity
   due to bad weather and Russian attacks.

   Ukraine has been bracing for an expected increase in Russian attacks
   targeting its energy infrastructure now that winter weather has set in.
   That would echo Moscow's campaign last winter that, at times, left
   millions of Ukrainians in cold and darkness and destroyed critical
   power facilities.

   "Due to bad weather and Russian shelling, a number of settlements in
   our region were left without electricity," Kherson Governor Oleksandr
   Prokudin said on Telegram. "Power supply teams are already working to
   eliminate the malfunctions," he added.

   Nearly 400 localities are without electricity in Ukraine due to
   "extremely difficult" weather conditions, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy
   said.

   Oleksiy Kuleba, deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office, warned
   that the weather is worsening with heavy snowfalls expected in the
   Kyiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, and Odesa regions.

Skopje Says Blinken To Attend OSCE Summit That May Include Lavrov

   SKOPJE -- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is slated to attend
   the OSCE ministerial summit in Skopje on November 30-December 1, North
   Macedonia’s foreign minister said, an event that could also include the
   presence of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

   "Secretary of State Blinken has been confirmed for the informal dinner
   [on November 29]," Foreign Minister Bujar Osmani told reporters on
   November 25 in North Macedonia's capital.

   "At the informal dinner, we expect the majority of ministers. This is
   where you talk openly, without writing speeches. We have set two issues
   for the informal dinner -- aggression in Ukraine and OSCE
   functionality," Osmani said.

   Osmani's comments come a day after Skopje said it would temporarily
   lift a ban on Russian flights to the Western Balkan country to allow
   the Russian delegation to attend the summit, although overall sanctions
   will remain in place for other flights.

   Days after Moscow launched its war against Ukraine in February 2022,
   Brussels closed EU airspace to Russian flights. North Macedonia aspires
   to join the bloc.

   "The decision on EU sanctions does not relate to multilateral events
   such as the OSCE, hence the government’s decision," Osmani said.

   Lavrov has not confirmed his intentions to travel to Skopje, but he has
   indicated he would like to attend with a delegation of some 80 people.
   Skopje has invited the Russian diplomat to participate.

   Washington has not confirmed Blinken's attendance at the Skopje summit,
   but the State Department on November 25 said the secretary would travel
   to Brussels for the NATO foreign ministers meeting, which will include
   discussions on Ukraine and "emphasize our support for democracy and
   regional stability in the Western Balkans."

   U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE Michael Carpenter said in Skopje on
   November 14 that "what Russia did to Ukraine is absolutely terrible."

   "The War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity Commission is troubled by
   Mr. Lavrov's participation.... But at the end of the day, the [OSCE] is
   inclusive and has 57 member states," Carpenter said.

   The European Commission on November 25 said it will provide 50 million
   euros ($54 million) to Kyiv to repair and upgrade infrastructure in
   Ukrainian ports in an attempt to increase food exports. "Improved port
   capacities will speed up exports of food and other goods which Ukraine
   supplies to global markets," European Commission President Ursula von
   der Leyen wrote in a letter to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
   "Over time, our investment should allow Ukraine's ports to return to
   export quantities that were in place before the war," she added.

   Iran has executed a 17-year-old boy who had been tried and convicted of
   murder, the Norway-based Hengaw and Iran Human Rights (IHR) groups
   said. IHR said the execution of Hamidreza Azari took place on November
   24. "It is important to note that in his previously aired forced
   confession and state media report, his age was given as 18," the IHR
   said. It quoted the Tasnim news agency as saying the youth was
   convicted in an alleged "honor" killing. Iran has seen a surge in

   About 1,000 residents of the village of Pavlovsk, in Russia's Altai
   region in southern Siberia, have staged an unsanctioned protest against
   the planned construction of a waste-recycling plant in their village.
   Participants voiced fear that the recycling plant will cause damage to
   the region's forests and rivers. Participants were holding banners
   reading "No to the monster plant in Pavlovsk," "Stop the garbage
   chaos," and "We demand a public environmental assessment." Altai
   regional authorities have been looking for a replacement of the solid
   landfill in the city of Barnaul, which was built back in 1974. To read

   Russia on November 25 unleashed the largest wave of drone attacks on
   Ukraine since the start of the war, wounding several people and causing
   damage, with Kyiv bearing the brunt of the attack, in what President
   Volodymyr Zelenskiy called "an act of willful terror."

   The attack occurred as Ukraine marked Holodomor Remembrance Day, which
   commemorates the 1932–33 man-made famine in Soviet Ukraine under
   dictator Josef Stalin that killed millions.

   "Russia launched around 70 Shahed drones at Ukraine precisely on the
   eve of the Holodomor genocide commemoration day," Zelenskiy wrote on X.

   Ukraine's air defense said in a statement that it had shot down 74 out
   of a total of 75 drones launched by Russia, with more than 60 drones
   being downed over Kyiv.

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine

   RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on
   Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military
   aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's
   coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.

   "Our warriors shot down the majority of the drones, but not all of
   them," Zelenskiy wrote. "We keep working to strengthen our air defense
   and unite the world in the fight against Russian terror. The terrorist
   state must be defeated and held accountable for its actions."
   "Russian barbarians staged the most massive drone attack on Kyiv and
   the air alert lasted six hours," Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko wrote on
   Telegram, adding that at least five people, including an 11-year-old
   child, were injured by debris from the drones shot down by air defense.
   All of them received medical treatment, he said.

   He said several districts of the capital were hit, with the most
   affected being the Solomyanskiy district, where a fire started by
   falling debris damaged a kindergarten.

   "This drone strike was the largest since the full-scale invasion
   began," the head of the Kyiv city military administration, Mykhaylo
   Shamanov, told Ukrainian television.

   The attack damaged a power line in the capital, leaving 120
   institutions and 77 residential buildings in the center of the capital
   without electricity, Kyiv's military administration said.

   The Ukrainian military's General Staff said in its November 25 evening
   report that Russia had launched 99 air strikes during the day and
   shelled Ukrainian positions and settlements 38 times with
   multiple-launch rocket systems.

   It also said there were 42 combat clashes and that the operation
   situation in the east and south "remains difficult."

   The General Staff added that Ukrainian forces had hit 11 sites of
   concentrations of Russian troops during the day.

   Ukraine has been bracing for an expected increase in Russian attacks
   targeting its energy infrastructure during the cold season in a repeat
   of Moscow's air campaign last winter that left millions of Ukrainians
   in cold and darkness and destroyed critical power facilities.

   Speaking at the Grain from Ukraine summit in Kyiv, Zelenskiy on
   November 25 said Ukraine needs more air defenses to protect its grain
   export routes.

   "There's a deficit of air defense. That is no secret," he told the
   international gathering attended by senior officials from several
   European states.

   In a separate address on the occasion of the Holodomor Remembrance Day,
   Zelenskiy called on the world to "unite and condemn the crimes of the
   past," and at the same time "unite and stop today's crimes."

   "Ninety years ago, the world could not fully see what was really
   happening [in Soviet Ukraine]. Now, there are only those who choose not
   to notice what is happening [in Moscow's unprovoked invasion of
   Ukraine]. They are not many, and they will be fewer and fewer. The
   truth is making its way," Zelenskiy said.

   The Holodomor, during which up to 4 million Ukrainians perished, has
   been recognized as genocide by almost 30 countries.

   The U.S. State Department marked the day as well, saying that "during
   Josef Stalin's regime, harsh and repressive policies were imposed upon
   Ukraine, including a deliberate famine that killed millions of innocent
   Ukrainian women, men, and children."

   "Since July, Russia has destroyed hundreds of thousands of tons of
   Ukrainian grain, along with grain infrastructure. As we remember the
   victims of the Holodomor, and we reaffirm our enduring commitment to
   Ukraine’s people, their freedom, and their democracy."

   Many of the Afghan families being driven out of Pakistan have no homes
   to return to and will struggle to feed themselves through the harsh
   winter, the UN warned on November 24. UN refugee agency UNHCR says more
   than 370,000 people have returned to Afghanistan since October 3, when
   Pakistan issued an ultimatum to the 1.7 million Afghans it says are
   living illegally in the country. "There are no open arms for these
   families," said Hsiao-Wei Lee, Afghanistan country director for the
   UN's World Food Program, who recently traveled to a border crossing to
   observe the distribution of food aid.
