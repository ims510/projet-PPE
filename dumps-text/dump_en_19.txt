   Ukrainian fighters on the front line say troops have not only crossed
   into Russian occupied territory but held a position, apparently for the
   first time, on the fiercely defended east (or left) bank of the Dnipro
   River in Kherson region.

   The development is potentially significant. Ukraine's counteroffensive
   aims to slice through Russian occupied territory, severing a land
   corridor to the Crimean peninsula which Moscow annexed - illegally - in
   2014.

   In a text exchange, the 46th brigade told the BBC that troops were
   engaged in heavy fighting as they try to take full control of the
   village of Krynky.

   If successful, the force said, the settlement would give advanced units
   a base from which to launch a larger offensive aimed at dividing
   Russian troops and cutting off their supply lines.

   The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that Ukrainian
   forces were continuing larger than usual ground operations on the east
   bank and Russian military bloggers have also noted fighting in Krynky.

   And the action is being closely scrutinised - success here would be
   seized upon by Ukraine's military chiefs. Their counteroffensive,
   launched in June, has made slow progress, with limited territorial
   gains.

   But the fighters we spoke to acknowledged that, even if the troops were
   to take Krynky, a modern day "Normandy landings" style attack was
   unlikely.

   And they gave us a glimpse of the dangers and challenges they face,
   particularly as winter approaches.

   The 46th brigade is fighting further along the vast front line in the
   Zaporizhzhia region with the same aim in mind - to cut off Russian
   access to the Crimean peninsula.

   They told us they had just managed to partially breach the first line
   of Russian defence near the village of Verbove - and that they'd
   successfully targeted some ammunition depots and bases, but that
   progress was limited.

   They described heavily mined Russian fortifications and daily air
   attacks on their logistics routes without, they complained, air support
   of their own.

   Russian troops, they said, had been on the defensive but were now on
   the attack.

   And, as winter approaches, conditions are deteriorating - for both
   sides.

   Rainy weather is affecting the work of drones, reconnaissance equipment
   and aviation, the soldiers said. But they did not anticipate any let-up
   in the fighting.

   "Winter will not be a time for respite," they said.
