   Intellectuals clash over country’s traditional commitment to defence of
   Israel amid bloodshed in Gaza

     * Israel-Hamas war – live updates

    Philip Oltermann European culture editor

     * * * The phrase “Never again” has been the central tenet of Germany’s
   political identity since the horrors of the Nazi-led Holocaust of Europe’s
   Jewish population. But the war between Israel and Hamas has opened up a
   fiercely fought debate about the phrase’s true meaning, dividing opinion
   among followers of the dominant German intellectual tradition.

   A letter published in the Guardian pits several prominent German and
   international figures influenced by the Frankfurt School of neo-Marxist
   “critical theory” against its most prominent living member, Jürgen
   Habermas. They argue that “Never again” must also mean staying alert to
   the possibility that what is unfolding in Gaza could amount to genocide.

   In a statement published on 13 November, Habermas made the case that the
   “Never again” principle must above all lead to a German commitment to
   protecting Jewish life and Israel’s right to exist.

   Habermas, 94, sometimes described as a contemporary successor to the
   Enlightenment philosophers for his writing on themes of power and justice,
   argued that Israel’s military retaliation following the 7 October Hamas
   attacks was “justified in principle”. Likening the resulting bloodshed in
   Gaza to a genocide was beyond the boundaries of acceptable debate, he
   said.

   “Despite all the concern for the fate of the Palestinian population […],
   the standards of judgment slip completely when genocidal intentions are
   attributed to Israel’s actions,” said the statement, which was also signed
   by the political scientist Rainer Forst, the lawyer Klaus Günther and the
   peace researcher Nicole Deitelhoff.

   In response, the letter published on Wednesday echoes Habermas’s
   condemnation of the Hamas attack and hostage-taking, but expresses concern
   over the “apparent limits of the solidarity expressed” by the philosopher
   and his co-authors.

   “The statement’s concern for human dignity is not adequately extended to
   Palestinian civilians in Gaza who are facing death and destruction,” it
   adds. “Nor is it applied or extended to Muslims in Germany experiencing
   rising Islamophobia. Solidarity means that the principle of human dignity
   must apply to all people. This requires us to recognise and address the
   suffering of all those affected by an armed conflict.”

   The letter continues: “We are concerned that there is no mention of
   upholding international law, which also prohibits war crimes and crimes
   against humanity such as collective punishment, persecution, and the
   destruction of civilian infrastructure including schools, hospitals and
   places of worship.”

   While “not all signatories believe that the legal standards for genocide
   have been met” by the situation in Gaza, the letter says, all of them
   “agree this is a matter of legitimate debate”.

   On Sunday, a group of UN experts said there was “evidence of increasing
   genocidal incitement” against the Palestinian people. Israeli officials
   reject this.

   The letter’s full list of more than 100 supporters includes several
   academics who have either directly emerged from the Frankfurt School or
   are employed at New York’s New School for Social Research, which sees
   itself working within the same critical theory tradition.

   Other signatories include the economist Adam Tooze, the legal historian
   Samuel Moyn, and the philosophers Amia Srinivasan and Nancy Fraser.

   More than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed by Hamas militants
   on 7 October. Since Israel’s counter-offensive was launched , more than
   14,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to Hamas-run health
   authorities.

   On Wednesday, Israel and Hamas agreed a deal for the release of 50 women
   and children hostages held in Gaza in return for 150 Palestinian women and
   children to be freed from Israeli jails during a four-day ceasefire.

   Founded in 1923, the Frankfurt School applied Marxist theory to philosophy
   and social theory to make sense of the rise of fascism out of apparently
   liberal European societies. Habermas, a former assistant to Theodor
   Adorno, took a more optimistic stance than the institution’s founding
   members, seeking to build an intellectual framework for democratic
   societies operating within market capitalism.

   Habermas’s letter reflects a strong, cross-party pro-Israel consensus in
   German politics. The to-and-fro of statements comes on the back of a
   motion for a resolution put forward on 7 November by the three centre-left
   and liberal parties of Olaf Scholz’s coalition government, which proposes
   allowing the extradition of non-German citizenship holders who spread
   hatred against Jews, as well as withdrawing funding from cultural
   institutions that support the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS)
   movement.

   Critics fear such a resolution would also result in the silencing of
   legitimate criticism of Israeli policies. In Berlin, the city senate is
   considering pulling funding for the Oyoun cultural centre in the German
   capital’s Neukölln district, after the centre’s directors reportedly
   refused to cancel a peace vigil by a leftwing Jewish group.
