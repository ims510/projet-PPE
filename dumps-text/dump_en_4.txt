   The Chinese Communist Party's Theory of Hybrid Warfare

   Nils Peterson on the People's Republic of China's theory of hybrid
   warfare.

   If the West Cuts Aid to Ukraine, Russia Will Win. If the West Leans in,
   Ukraine Can Win.

   Fred Kagan writes about why the positional war in Ukraine is not a stable
   stalemate and how the current balance could readily be tipped in either
   direction by decisions made in the West.

Iran Update, December 9, 2023

   Dec 9, 2023 - ISW Press

   Israeli forces continued clearing operations in Khan Younis as Palestinian
   militias attempt to resist Israeli advances. Israeli forces located
   several tunnel shafts and a Hamas military headquarters as they advanced
   in Khan Younis. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) engaged three Palestinian
   fighters as they emerged from a tunnel in central Khan Younis and fired a
   rocket-propelled grenade (RPG).Hamas maintains an extensive tunnel system
   across the Gaza Strip, which Israeli forces have destroyed as they have
   advanced. Israeli forces also raided a mosque from which Hamas fighters
   were operating. The IDF said the Hamas fighters detonated an IED near
   Israeli forces.

Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, December 9, 2023

   Dec 9, 2023 - ISW Press

   Russian forces have likely committed to offensive operations in multiple
   sectors of the front during a period of the most challenging weather of
   the fall-winter season in an effort to seize and retain the initiative
   prior to the Russian presidential elections in March 2024. Russian forces
   are currently pursuing offensive efforts along much of the frontline in
   Ukraine, particularly along the Kharkiv-Luhansk Oblast border, near
   Bakhmut, and towards Avdiivka as Ukrainian military officials have
   repeatedly noted, and Russian forces are also conducting continuous ground
   attacks in western Zaporizhia Oblast. The current pace of fighting across
   the entire frontline in Ukraine is generally consistent with ISW's
   standing assessment that Russian forces have been trying to regain the
   theater-level initiative since at least mid-November 2023. Recent
   Ukrainian military official statements further suggest that Russian forces
   have succeeded in seizing the initiative along the Kharkiv-Luhansk Oblast
   border, near Bakhmut, and along the Avdiivka-Donetsk City axis, while
   Ukrainian forces maintain the initiative in key areas of southern Ukraine,
   as evidenced by continued Ukrainian counterattacks in western Zaporizhia
   Oblast and the sustained, larger-than-usual Ukrainian presence in east
   bank Kherson Oblast.

Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, December 8, 2023

   Dec 8, 2023 - ISW Press

   Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his presidential bid for 2024
   on December 8 in an obviously staged effort to seem that he was running at
   the request of Russian servicemen. Putin announced that he would run for
   president in the 2024 elections in conversation with Russian military
   personnel after the presentation of Gold Star medals in the Grand Kremlin
   Palace on December 8.

China-Taiwan Weekly Update, December 7, 2023

   Dec 8, 2023 - ISW Press

   KMT presidential candidate Hou Yu-ih gained significant support since
   November 24 and closed the gap with DPP presidential candidate Lai
   Ching-te, who leads in the polls. Taiwan’s presidential election settled
   into a three-way race last week after Lai, Hou, and TPP candidate Ko
   Wen-je registered their candidacies during the week of November 20. Hou
   and Ko registered and announced their respective running mates on November
   24, the last day for registration, after the collapse of their
   eleventh-hour negotiations to form a joint ticket to challenge Lai.
   Polling data since the joint ticket collapse shows Hou Yu-ih’s support has
   risen considerably.

   Dec 8, 2023 - ISW Press

   Iranian-backed Iraqi militias conducted an indirect fire attack targeting
   the US Embassy in Baghdad on December 8 for the first time since 2021,
   marking a notable escalation in Iranian efforts to expel US forces from
   Iraq. An unidentified US military official reported that unidentified
   militants fired multiple rockets at the US Embassy in Baghdad and Forward
   Operating Base (FOB) Union III, landing near the embassy’s gates and in
   the river nearby.

The Order of Battle of Hamas’ Izz al Din al Qassem Brigades, Part 1: North and
Central Gaza

   Dec 8, 2023 - ISW Press

   The al Qassem Brigades are the military component of Hamas and the means
   by which Hamas seeks to destroy the Israeli state and form an Islamic
   state in Palestine. Hamas is a highly organized group that views terrorism
   and military action as the only method through which it can destroy the
   Israeli state. The al Qassem Brigades are commanded by Mohammad Deif and
   are subordinated to the overall Hamas political leadership responsible to
   Ismail Haniyeh. They coordinate closely with the Hamas political leader in
   the Gaza Strip, Yahya Sinwar. Hamas defines itself as a "Palestinian
   national liberation and resistance movement” intent on establishing an
   Islamic Palestinian state that stretches “from the River Jordan...to the
   Mediterranean and from Ras al Naqurah...to Umm al Rashrash.” It is also a
   member of Iran’s ”Axis of Resistance,” the regional coalition of states
   and groups that Tehran has built as part of its effort to destroy Israel
   and expel the United States from the Middle East. Hamas states that "armed
   resistance” is a "strategic choice” to protect the Palestinian people and
   rejects "any attempt to undermine [Hamas’] resistance.” Hamas is fighting
   alongside other Palestinian resistance groups such as Palestinian Islamic
   Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, with which it
   engages in operational and tactical coordination.
