   war, in the popular sense, a conflict between political groups
   involving hostilities of considerable duration and magnitude. In the
   usage of social science, certain qualifications are added. Sociologists
   usually apply the term to such conflicts only if they are initiated and
   conducted in accordance with socially recognized forms. They treat war
   as an institution recognized in custom or in law. Military writers
   usually confine the term to hostilities in which the contending groups
   are sufficiently equal in power to render the outcome uncertain for a
   time. Armed conflicts of powerful states with isolated and powerless
   peoples are usually called pacifications, military expeditions, or
   explorations; with small states, they are called interventions or
   reprisals; and with internal groups, rebellions or insurrections. Such
   incidents, if the resistance is sufficiently strong or protracted, may
   achieve a magnitude that entitles them to the name “war.”

   In all ages war has been an important topic of analysis. In the latter
   part of the 20th century, in the aftermath of two World Wars and in the
   shadow of nuclear, biological, and chemical holocaust, more was written
   on the subject than ever before. Endeavours to understand the nature of
   war, to formulate some theory of its causes, conduct, and prevention,
   are of great importance, for theory shapes human expectations and
   determines human behaviour. The various schools of theorists are
   generally aware of the profound influence they can exercise upon life,
   and their writings usually include a strong normative element, for,
   when accepted by politicians, their ideas can assume the
   characteristics of self-fulfilling prophecies.

   The analysis of war may be divided into several categories.
   Philosophical, political, economic, technological, legal, sociological,
   and psychological approaches are frequently distinguished. These
   distinctions indicate the varying focuses of interest and the different
   analytical categories employed by the theoretician, but most of the
   actual theories are mixed because war is an extremely complex social
   phenomenon that cannot be explained by any single factor or through any
   single approach.

Evolution of theories of war

   Reflecting changes in the international system, theories of war have
   passed through several phases in the course of the past three
   centuries. After the ending of the wars of religion, about the middle
   of the 17th century, wars were fought for the interests of individual
   sovereigns and were limited both in their objectives and in their
   scope. The art of maneuver became decisive, and analysis of war was
   couched accordingly in terms of strategies. The situation changed
   fundamentally with the outbreak of the French Revolution, which
   increased the size of forces from small professional to large conscript
   armies and broadened the objectives of war to the ideals of the
   revolution, ideals that appealed to the masses who were subject to
   conscription. In the relative order of post-Napoleonic Europe, the
   mainstream of theory returned to the idea of war as a rational, limited
   instrument of national policy. This approach was best articulated by
   the Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz in his famous
   classic On War (1832–37).

   World War I, which was “total” in character because it resulted in the
   mobilization of entire populations and economies for a prolonged period
   of time, did not fit into the Clausewitzian pattern of limited
   conflict, and it led to a renewal of other theories. These no longer
   regarded war as a rational instrument of state policy. The theorists
   held that war, in its modern, total form, if still conceived as a
   national state instrument, should be undertaken only if the most vital
   interests of the state, touching upon its very survival, are concerned.
   Otherwise, warfare serves broad ideologies and not the more narrowly
   defined interests of a sovereign or a nation. Like the religious wars
   of the 17th century, war becomes part of “grand designs,” such as the
   rising of the proletariat in communist eschatology or the Nazi doctrine
   of a master race.

   Some theoreticians have gone even further, denying war any rational
   character whatsoever. To them war is a calamity and a social disaster,
   whether it is afflicted by one nation upon another or conceived of as
   afflicting humanity as a whole. The idea is not new—in the aftermath of
   the Napoleonic Wars it was articulated, for example, by Tolstoy in the
   concluding chapter of War and Peace (1865–69). In the second half of
   the 20th century it gained new currency in peace research, a
   contemporary form of theorizing that combines analysis of the origins
   of warfare with a strong normative element aiming at its prevention.
   Peace research concentrates on two areas: the analysis of the
   international system and the empirical study of the phenomenon of war.

   World War II and the subsequent evolution of weapons of mass
   destruction made the task of understanding the nature of war even more
   urgent. On the one hand, war had become an intractable social
   phenomenon, the elimination of which seemed to be an essential
   precondition for the survival of mankind. On the other hand, the use of
   war as an instrument of policy was calculated in an unprecedented
   manner by the nuclear superpowers, the United States and the Soviet
   Union. War also remained a stark but rational instrumentality in
   certain more limited conflicts, such as those between Israel and the
   Arab nations. Thinking about war, consequently, became increasingly
   more differentiated because it had to answer questions related to very
   different types of conflict.
   Carl von Clausewitz (BUTTON)

   Clausewitz cogently defines war as a rational instrument of foreign
   policy: “an act of violence intended to compel our opponent to fulfill
   our will.” Modern definitions of war, such as “armed conflict between
   political units,” generally disregard the narrow, legalistic
   definitions characteristic of the 19th century, which limited the
   concept to formally declared war between states. Such a definition
   includes civil wars but at the same time excludes such phenomena as
   insurrections, banditry, or piracy. Finally, war is generally
   understood to embrace only armed conflicts on a fairly large scale,
   usually excluding conflicts in which fewer than 50,000 combatants are
   involved.
