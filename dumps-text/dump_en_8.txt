   The Israeli–Palestinian conflict is an ongoing military and political
   conflict in the Levant. Beginning in the mid-20th century, it is one of
   the world's longest continuing conflicts.^[3] Various attempts have
   been made to resolve the conflict as part of the Israeli–Palestinian
   peace process, alongside other efforts to resolve the broader
   Arab–Israeli conflict.^[4]^[5]^[6]^[7] Public declarations of the
   desire to see a Jewish homeland established in Palestine, including the
   First Zionist Congress of 1897 and the Balfour Declaration of 1917,
   created early tensions in the region after waves of Jewish immigration.
   Following World War I, the Mandate for Palestine included a binding
   obligation for the "establishment in Palestine of a national home for
   the Jewish people". Tensions grew into open sectarian conflict between
   Jews and Arabs.^[8]^[9] The 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for
   Palestine was never implemented and provoked the 1947–1949 Palestine
   War. The current Israeli-Palestinian status quo began following Israeli
   military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, known as the Palestinian
   territories, in the 1967 Six-Day War.

   Progress was made towards a two-state solution with the Oslo Accords of
   1993–1995. Final status issues include the status of Jerusalem, Israeli
   settlements, borders, security and water rights^[10] as well as
   Palestinian freedom of movement^[11] and the Palestinian right of
   return. The violence of the conflict in the region—rich in sites of
   historic, cultural, and religious interest worldwide—has been the
   subject of numerous international conferences dealing with historic
   rights, security issues, and human rights, and has been a factor
   limiting access to, and tourism in, areas that are highly
   contested.^[12] The majority of peace efforts have been centred around
   the two-state solution, which involves the establishment of an
   independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. Public support for a
   two-state solution, which formerly enjoyed support from both Israeli
   Jews and Palestinians,^[13]^[14]^[15] has dwindled in recent
   years.^[16]^[17]^[18]

   Within Israeli and Palestinian society, the conflict generates a wide
   variety of views and opinions, with some claiming that the violence
   perpetrated by the Israelis against the Palestinians is part of a
   genocide, while others claim Palestinians use worldwide terrorism to
   promote their interests. Since its inception, the conflict's casualties
   have not been restricted to combatants, with a large number of civilian
   fatalities on both sides. A minority of Jewish Israelis (32 percent)
   support a two-state solution with the Palestinians.^[19] Israeli Jews
   are divided along ideological lines, and many favor maintaining the
   status quo.^[17] Approximately 60 percent of Palestinians (77% in the
   Gaza Strip and 46% in the West Bank), support armed attacks against
   Israelis within Israel as a means of ending the occupation, while 70%
   believe that a two-state solution is no longer practical or possible as
   a result of the expansion of Israeli settlements.^[18] More than
   two-thirds of Israeli Jews say that if the West Bank were annexed by
   Israel, Palestinians resident there should not be permitted to
   vote.^[20] Mutual distrust and significant disagreements are deep over
   basic issues, as is the reciprocal skepticism about the other side's
   commitment to upholding obligations in an eventual bilateral
   agreement.^[21] Since 2006, the Palestinian side has been fractured by
   conflict between Fatah, the traditionally dominant party, and its later
   electoral challenger, Hamas,^[a] a militant Islamist group that gained
   control of the Gaza Strip.^[22] Attempts to remedy this have been
   repeated and continuing. Since 2019, the Israeli side has also been
   experiencing political upheaval, with four inconclusive legislative
   elections having been held over a span of two years.^[23]^[24] The
   latest round of peace negotiations began in July 2013 but were
   suspended in 2014. Since 2006, Hamas and Israel have fought five wars,
   the most recent in 2023.^[22]

   The two parties that engage in direct negotiation are the Israeli
   government and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Official
   negotiations are mediated by the Quartet on the Middle East, which
   consists of the United Nations, the United States, Russia, and the
   European Union. The Arab League, which has proposed the Arab Peace
   Initiative, is another important actor. Egypt, a founding member of the
   Arab League, has historically been a key participant in the
   Arab–Israeli conflict and related negotiations, more so since the
   Egypt–Israel peace treaty. Another key participant is Jordan, which
   annexed the West Bank in 1950 and held it until 1967, relinquishing its
   territorial claim over it to the Palestinians in 1988. An Israel–Jordan
   peace treaty was signed in 1994. The Jordanian royal family, the
   Hashemites, are responsible for custodianship over Muslim and Christian
   holy sites in Jerusalem.

   newspaper featuring a caricature on its 18 June 1936 edition showing
   Zionism as a crocodile under the protection of a British officer
   telling Palestinian Arabs: "don't be afraid!!! I will swallow you
   peacefully...".^[25]

   The Israeli–Palestinian conflict has its roots in the late 19th and
   early 20th centuries, with the birth of major nationalist movements
   among the Jews and among the Arabs, both geared towards attaining
   sovereignty for their people in the Middle East.^[26] The Balfour
   Declaration was a public statement issued by the British government in
   1917 during the First World War announcing support for the
   establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in
   Palestine.^[27] The collision between those two movements in southern
   Levant upon the emergence of Palestinian nationalism after the
   Franco-Syrian War in the 1920s escalated into the Sectarian conflict in
   Mandatory Palestine in 1930s and 1940s, and expanded into the wider
   Arab–Israeli conflict later on.^[28]

   The return of several hard-line Palestinian Arab nationalists, under
   the emerging leadership of Haj Amin al-Husseini, from Damascus to
   Mandatory Palestine marked the beginning of Palestinian Arab
   nationalist struggle towards establishment of a national home for Arabs
   of Palestine.^[29] Amin al-Husseini, the architect of the Palestinian
   Arab national movement, immediately marked Jewish national movement and
   Jewish immigration to Palestine as the sole enemy to his cause,^[30]
   initiating large-scale riots against the Jews as early as 1920 in
   Jerusalem and in 1921 in Jaffa. Among the results of the violence was
   the establishment of the Jewish paramilitary force Haganah. In 1929, a
   series of violent riots resulted in the deaths of 133 Jews and 116
   Arabs, with significant Jewish casualties in Hebron and Safed, and the
   evacuation of Jews from Hebron and Gaza.^[26]
   [220px-Palest_against_british.gif] The Arab revolt of 1936–1939 in
   Palestine, motivated by opposition to mass Jewish immigration allowed
   by the British Mandate.

   In the early 1930s, the Arab national struggle in Palestine had drawn
   many Arab nationalist militants from across the Middle East, such as
   Sheikh Izaddin al-Qassam from Syria, who established the Black Hand
   militant group and had prepared the grounds for the 1936–1939 Arab
   revolt in Palestine. Following the death of al-Qassam at the hands of
   the British in late 1935, tensions erupted in 1936 into the Arab
   general strike and general boycott. The strike soon deteriorated into
   violence, and the Arab revolt was bloodily repressed by the British
   assisted by associated forces of the Jewish Settlement Police, the
   Jewish Supernumerary Police, and Special Night Squads.^[28] In the
   first wave of organized violence, lasting until early 1937, most of the
   Arab groups were defeated by the British, and forced expulsion of much
   of the Arab leadership ensued. The revolt led to the establishment of
   the Peel Commission towards partitioning of Palestine, though it was
   subsequently rejected by the Palestinian Arabs. The two main Jewish
   leaders, Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion, accepted the
   recommendations but some secondary Jewish leaders disapproved of
   it.^[31]^[32]^[33]

   The renewed violence, which continued sporadically until the beginning
   of World War II, ended with around 5,000 casualties, mostly from the
   Arab side. With the eruption of World War II, the situation in
   Mandatory Palestine calmed down. It allowed a shift towards a more
   moderate stance among Palestinian Arabs under the leadership of the
   Nashashibi clan and even the establishment of the Jewish–Arab Palestine
   Regiment under British command, fighting Germans in North Africa. The
   more radical exiled faction of al-Husseini, however, tended to
   cooperate with Nazi Germany, and participated in the establishment of a
   pro-Nazi propaganda machine throughout the Arab world. The defeat of
   Arab nationalists in Iraq and subsequent relocation of al-Husseini to
   Nazi-occupied Europe tied his hands regarding field operations in
   Palestine, though he regularly demanded that the Italians and the
   Germans bomb Tel Aviv. By the end of World War II, a crisis over the
   fate of the Holocaust survivors from Europe led to renewed tensions
   between the Yishuv and the Palestinian Arab leadership. Immigration
   quotas were established by the British, while on the other hand illegal
   immigration and Zionist insurgency against the British was
   increasing.^[26]
   [150px-Cia-is-map2.png] Land in the lighter shade represents territory
   within the borders of Israel at the conclusion of the 1948 war. This
   land is internationally recognized as belonging to Israel.

   On 29 November 1947, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted
   Resolution 181(II)^[34] recommending the adoption and implementation of
   a plan to partition Palestine into an Arab state, a Jewish state and
   the City of Jerusalem.^[35] On the next day, Palestine was swept by
   violence. For four months, under continuous Arab provocation and
   attack, the Yishuv was usually on the defensive while occasionally
   retaliating.^[36] The Arab League supported the Arab struggle by
   forming the volunteer-based Arab Liberation Army, supporting the
   Palestinian Arab Army of the Holy War, under the leadership of Abd
   al-Qadir al-Husayni and Hasan Salama. On the Jewish side, the civil war
   was managed by the major underground militias – the Haganah, Irgun and
   Lehi – strengthened by numerous Jewish veterans of World War II and
   foreign volunteers. By spring 1948, it was already clear that the Arab
   forces were nearing a total collapse, while Yishuv forces gained more
   and more territory, creating a large scale refugee problem of
   Palestinian Arabs.^[26]

  1948 Arab–Israeli War

   Main article: 1948 Arab-Israeli War

   Following the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel
   on 14 May 1948, the Arab League decided to intervene on behalf of
   Palestinian Arabs, marching their forces into former British Palestine,
   beginning the main phase of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.^[35] The overall
   fighting, leading to around 15,000 casualties, resulted in cease-fire
   and armistice agreements of 1949, with Israel holding much of the
   former Mandate territory, Jordan occupying and later annexing the West
   Bank and Egypt taking over the Gaza Strip, where the All-Palestine
   Government was declared by the Arab League on 22 September 1948.^[28]

  1956 Arab–Israeli War

   Main article: 1956 Suez Crisis

   Through the 1950s, Jordan and Egypt supported the Palestinian Fedayeen
   militants' cross-border attacks into Israel, while Israel carried out
   its own reprisal operations in the host countries. The 1956 Suez Crisis
   resulted in a short-term Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and exile
   of the All-Palestine Government, which was later restored with Israeli
   withdrawal. The All-Palestine Government was completely abandoned by
   Egypt in 1959 and was officially merged into the United Arab Republic,
   to the detriment of the Palestinian national movement. Gaza Strip then
   was put under the authority of the Egyptian military administrator,
   making it a de facto military occupation. In 1964, however, a new
   organization, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), was
   established by Yasser Arafat.^[35] It immediately won the support of
   most Arab League governments and was granted a seat in the Arab League.

  1967 Arab–Israeli War

   Main article: 1967 Six Day War

   [170px-6DayWarEnglish.png] During the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel
   captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights and the Sinai
   Peninsula. Each of these territories except the Sinai remain under
   Israeli occupation.

   The 1967 Six-Day War exerted a significant effect upon Palestinian
   nationalism, as Israel gained military control of the West Bank from
   Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt. Consequently, the PLO was unable
   to establish any control on the ground and established its headquarters
   in Jordan, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and supported
   the Jordanian army during the War of Attrition, which included the
   Battle of Karameh. However, the Palestinian base in Jordan collapsed
   with the Jordanian–Palestinian civil war in 1970. The PLO defeat by the
   Jordanians caused most of the Palestinian militants to relocate to
   South Lebanon, where they soon took over large areas, creating the
   so-called "Fatahland".

  1973 Arab–Israeli War

   Main article: Yom Kippur War

   On October 6, 1973, a coalition of Arab forces consisting of mainly
   Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack against Israel on the Jewish
   holy day of Yom Kippur. Egyptian and Syria had crossed over the
   ceasefire lines that were agreed upon prior to 1973. Egypt had in
   particular tried to reoccupy much of the area surrounding the Suez
   Canal, whilst the frontline with Syria was mainly situated around the
   north in the Golan Heights. The war concluded with an Israeli victory,
   with both sides suffering tremendous casualties.

  1982 Lebanon War

   Main article: 1982 Lebanon War

   Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon peaked in the early 1970s, as
   Lebanon was used as a base to launch attacks on northern Israel and
   airplane hijacking campaigns worldwide, which drew Israeli retaliation.
   During the Lebanese Civil War, Palestinian militants continued to
   launch attacks against Israel while also battling opponents within
   Lebanon. In 1978, the Coastal Road massacre led to the Israeli
   full-scale invasion known as Operation Litani. Israeli forces, however,
   quickly withdrew from Lebanon, and the attacks against Israel resumed.
   In 1982, following an assassination attempt on one of its diplomats by
   Palestinians, the Israeli government decided to take sides in the
   Lebanese Civil War and the 1982 Lebanon War commenced. The initial
   results for Israel were successful. Most Palestinian militants were
   defeated within several weeks, Beirut was captured, and the PLO
   headquarters were evacuated to Tunisia in June by Yasser Arafat's
   decision.^[28]

  First Intifada (1987–1993)

   Main article: First Intifada

   The first Palestinian uprising began in 1987 as a response to
   escalating attacks and the endless occupation. By the early 1990s,
   international efforts to settle the conflict had begun, in light of the
   success of the Egyptian–Israeli peace treaty of 1982. Eventually, the
   Israeli–Palestinian peace process led to the Oslo Accords of 1993,
   allowing the PLO to relocate from Tunisia and take ground in the West
   Bank and Gaza Strip, establishing the Palestinian National Authority.
   The peace process also had significant opposition among radical Islamic
   elements of Palestinian society, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic
   Jihad, who immediately initiated a campaign of attacks targeting
   Israelis. Following hundreds of casualties and a wave of radical
   anti-government propaganda, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin was
   assassinated by an Israeli far-right extremist who objected to the
   peace initiative. This struck a serious blow to the peace process, from
   which the newly elected government of Israel in 1996 backed off.^[26]

   Strip.[220px-Allenby_Street_bus_bombing_III.jpg] Aftermath of a
   Palestinian suicide bombing on a bus in Tel Aviv

   Following several years of unsuccessful negotiations, the conflict
   re-erupted as the Second Intifada in September 2000.^[28] The violence,
   escalating into an open conflict between the Palestinian National
   Security Forces and the Israel Defense Forces, lasted until 2004/2005
   and led to approximately 130 fatalities. In 2005, Israeli Prime
   Minister Sharon ordered the removal of Israeli settlers and soldiers
   from Gaza. Israel and its Supreme Court formally declared an end to
   occupation, saying it "had no effective control over what occurred" in
   Gaza.^[37] However, the United Nations, Human Rights Watch and many
   other international bodies and NGOs continue to consider Israel to be
   the occupying power of the Gaza Strip as Israel controls Gaza Strip's
   airspace, territorial waters and controls the movement of people or
   goods in or out of Gaza by air or sea.^[37]^[38]^[39]

  Fatah–Hamas split (2006–2007)

   In 2006, Hamas won a plurality of 44% in the Palestinian parliamentary
   election. Israel responded it would begin economic sanctions unless
   Hamas agreed to accept prior Israeli–Palestinian agreements, forswear
   violence, and recognize Israel's right to exist, all of which Hamas
   rejected.^[40] After internal Palestinian political struggle between
   Fatah and Hamas erupted into the Battle of Gaza (2007), Hamas took full
   control of the area.^[41] In 2007, Israel imposed a naval blockade on
   the Gaza Strip, and cooperation with Egypt allowed a ground blockade of
   the Egyptian border.

   The tensions between Israel and Hamas escalated until late 2008, when
   Israel launched operation Cast Lead upon Gaza, resulting in thousands
   of civilian casualties and billions of dollars in damage. By February
   2009, a ceasefire was signed with international mediation between the
   parties, though the occupation and small and sporadic eruptions of
   violence continued.^[citation needed]

   In 2011, a Palestinian Authority attempt to gain UN membership as a
   fully sovereign state failed. In Hamas-controlled Gaza, sporadic rocket
   attacks on Israel and Israeli air raids still take
   place.^[42]^[43]^[44]^[45] In November 2012, the representation of
   Palestine in UN was upgraded to a non-member observer State, and its
   mission title was changed from "Palestine (represented by PLO)" to
   "State of Palestine". In 2014, another war between Israel and Gaza
   occurred resulting in over 70 Israeli casualties and over 2000
   Palestinians casualties.

  Israeli far-right government (2022)

   In November 2022, with the election of the 37th government of Israel, a
   coalition government led by Benjamin Netanyahu and notable for its
   inclusion of far-right politicians,^[46] violence in the conflict
   increased, with events such as the January 2023 Jenin incursion, the
   June 2023 Jenin incursion, the July 2023 Jenin incursion, the 2023 Neve
   Yaakov shooting, the 2023 Al-Aqsa clashes, the May 2023 Gaza–Israel
   clashes, and the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, alongside Palestinian political
   violence has produced a death toll in 2023 that is the highest in the
   conflict since 2005.^[47]

Peace process

   Main article: Oslo Accords

   [220px-Israel_and_Palestine_Peace.svg.png] A peace movement poster:
   Israeli and Palestinian flags and the word peace in Arabic and Hebrew.

   In 1993, Israeli officials led by Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leaders
   from the Palestine Liberation Organization led by Yasser Arafat strove
   to find a peaceful solution through what became known as the Oslo peace
   process. A crucial milestone in this process was Arafat's letter of
   recognition of Israel's right to exist. In 1993, the Oslo Accords were
   finalized as a framework for future Israeli–Palestinian relations. The
   crux of the Oslo agreement was that Israel would gradually cede control
   of the Palestinian territories over to the Palestinians in exchange for
   peace. The Oslo process was delicate and progressed in fits and starts.
   The process took a turning point at the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin
   in November 1995 and finally unraveled when Arafat and Ehud Barak
   failed to reach an agreement at Camp David in July 2000. Robert Malley,
   special assistant to US President Bill Clinton for Arab–Israeli
   Affairs, has confirmed that while Barak made no formal written offer to
   Arafat, the US did present concepts for peace which were considered by
   the Israeli side yet left unanswered by Arafat: "the Palestinians'
   principal failing is that from the beginning of the Camp David summit
   onward they were unable either to say yes to the American ideas or to
   present a cogent and specific counterproposal of their own".^[48]
   Consequently, there are different accounts of the proposals
   considered.^[49]^[50]^[51]

  Camp David Summit (2000)

   In July 2000, US President Bill Clinton convened a peace summit between
   Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
   Barak. Barak reportedly put forward the following as "bases for
   negotiation", via the US to the Palestinian President: a
   non-militarized Palestinian state split into 3–4 parts containing
   87–92%^[en 1] of the West Bank including only parts of East Jerusalem,
   and the entire Gaza Strip,^[52]^[53] as well as a stipulation that 69
   Jewish settlements (which comprise 85% of the West Bank's Jewish
   settlers) would be ceded to Israel, no right of return to Israel, no
   sovereignty over the Temple Mount or any core East Jerusalem
   neighbourhoods, and continued Israel control over the Jordan
   Valley.^[54]^[55]

   Arafat rejected this offer.^[52]^[56]^[57]^[58]^[59]^[60] According to
   the Palestinian negotiators the offer did not remove many of the
   elements of the Israeli occupation regarding land, security,
   settlements, and Jerusalem.^[61] President Clinton reportedly requested
   that Arafat make a counter-offer, but he proposed none. Former Israeli
   Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben Ami who kept a diary of the negotiations
   said in an interview in 2001, when asked whether the Palestinians made
   a counterproposal: "No. And that is the heart of the matter. Never, in
   the negotiations between us and the Palestinians, was there a
   Palestinian counterproposal."^[62] In a separate interview in 2006 Ben
   Ami stated that were he a Palestinian he would have rejected the Camp
   David offer.^[63]

   No tenable solution was crafted which would satisfy both Israeli and
   Palestinian demands, even under intense US pressure. Clinton has long
   blamed Arafat for the collapse of the summit.^[64] In the months
   following the summit, Clinton appointed former US Senator George J.
   Mitchell to lead a fact-finding committee aiming to identify strategies
   for restoring the peace process. The committee's findings were
   published in 2001 with the dismantlement of existing Israeli
   settlements and Palestinian crackdown on militant activity being one
   strategy.^[65]

  Developments following Camp David

   Following the failed summit Palestinian and Israeli negotiators
   continued to meet in small groups through August and September 2000 to
   try to bridge the gaps between their respective positions. The United
   States prepared its own plan to resolve the outstanding issues.
   Clinton's presentation of the US proposals was delayed by the advent of
   the Second Intifada at the end of September.^[61]

   Clinton's plan, eventually presented on 23 December 2000, proposed the
   establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state in the Gaza strip and
   94–96 percent of the West Bank plus the equivalent of 1–3 percent of
   the West Bank in land swaps from pre-1967 Israel. On Jerusalem, the
   plan stated that "the general principle is that Arab areas are
   Palestinian and that Jewish areas are Israeli." The holy sites were to
   be split on the basis that Palestinians would have sovereignty over the
   Temple Mount/Noble sanctuary, while the Israelis would have sovereignty
   over the Western Wall. On refugees the plan suggested a number of
   proposals including financial compensation, the right of return to the
   Palestinian state, and Israeli acknowledgment of suffering caused to
   the Palestinians in 1948. Security proposals referred to a
   "non-militarized" Palestinian state, and an international force for
   border security. Both sides accepted Clinton's plan^[61]^[66]^[67] and
   it became the basis for the negotiations at the Taba Peace summit the
   following January.^[61]

  Taba Summit (2001)

   Main article: Taba Summit

   The Israeli negotiation team presented a new map at the Taba Summit in
   Taba, Egypt, in January 2001. The proposition removed the "temporarily
   Israeli controlled" areas, and the Palestinian side accepted this as a
   basis for further negotiation. With Israeli elections looming the talks
   ended without an agreement but the two sides issued a joint statement
   attesting to the progress they had made: "The sides declare that they
   have never been closer to reaching an agreement and it is thus our
   shared belief that the remaining gaps could be bridged with the
   resumption of negotiations following the Israeli elections." The
   following month the Likud party candidate Ariel Sharon defeated Ehud
   Barak in the Israeli elections and was elected as Israeli prime
   minister on 7 February 2001. Sharon's new government chose not to
   resume the high-level talks.^[61]

   One peace proposal, presented by the Quartet of the European Union,
   Russia, the United Nations and the United States on 17 September 2002,
   was the Road Map for Peace. This plan did not attempt to resolve
   difficult questions such as the fate of Jerusalem or Israeli
   settlements, but left that to be negotiated in later phases of the
   process. The proposal never made it beyond the first phase, whose goals
   called for a halt to both Israeli settlement construction and
   Israeli–Palestinian violence. Neither goal has been achieved as of
   November 2015.^[68]^[69]^[70]

  Arab Peace Initiative (2002, 2007, 2017)

   Main article: Arab Peace Initiative

   The Arab Peace Initiative (Arabic: مبادرة السلام العربية Mubādirat
   as-Salām al-ʿArabīyyah), also known as the Saudi Initiative, was first
   proposed by Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia at the Beirut Summit
   (2002). The peace initiative is a proposed solution to the Arab–Israeli
   conflict as a whole, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in
   particular.^[71] The initiative was initially published on 28 March
   2002, at the Beirut Summit, and agreed upon again in 2007 in the Riyadh
   Summit. Unlike the Road Map for Peace, it spelled out "final-solution"
   borders based explicitly on the UN borders established before the 1967
   Six-Day War. It offered full normalization of relations with Israel, in
   exchange for the withdrawal of its forces from all the occupied
   territories, including the Golan Heights, to recognize "an independent
   Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital" in the West Bank
   and Gaza Strip, as well as a "just solution" for the Palestinian
   refugees.^[72]

   The Palestinian Authority led by Yasser Arafat immediately embraced the
   initiative.^[73] His successor Mahmoud Abbas also supported the plan
   and officially asked U.S. President Barack Obama to adopt it as part of
   his Middle East policy.^[74] Islamist political party Hamas, the
   elected government of the Gaza Strip, was deeply divided,^[75] with
   most factions rejecting the plan.^[76] Palestinians have criticised the
   Israel–United Arab Emirates normalization agreement and another with
   Bahrain signed in September 2020, fearing the moves weaken the Arab
   Peace Initiative, regarding the UAE's move as "a betrayal."^[77]

   The Israeli government under Ariel Sharon rejected the initiative as a
   "non-starter"^[78] because it required Israel to withdraw to pre-June
   1967 borders.^[79] After the renewed Arab League endorsement in 2007,
   then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert gave a cautious welcome to the
   plan.^[80] In 2015, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed
   tentative support for the Initiative,^[81] but in 2018, he rejected it
   as a basis for future negotiations with the Palestinians.^[82]

Current status

   Main articles: Israeli–Palestinian peace process and Israel and
   apartheid

   The peace process has been predicated on a "two-state solution" thus
   far, but questions have been raised towards both sides' resolve to end
   the dispute.^[83] An article by S. Daniel Abraham, an American
   entrepreneur and founder of the Center for Middle East Peace in
   Washington, US, published on the website of the Atlantic magazine in
   March 2013, cited the following statistics: "Right now, the total
   number of Jews and Arabs living... in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza
   is just under 12 million people. At the moment, a shade under 50
   percent of the population is Jewish."^[84]

   In April 2021, Human Rights Watch released its report A Threshold
   Crossed, making accusations that the policies of Israel towards
   Palestinians living in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza constituted the
   crime of apartheid.^[85] A further report titled Israel's Apartheid
   Against Palestinians: Cruel System of Domination and Crime Against
   Humanity was released by Amnesty International on 1 February 2022.^[86]

  Israel's settlements policy

   [220px-SettlersShuhadaStreet.jpg] Israeli settlers in Hebron, West Bank

   Israel has had its settlement growth and policies in the Palestinian
   territories harshly criticized by the European Union citing it as
   increasingly undermining the viability of the two-state solution and
   running in contrary to the Israeli-stated commitment to resume
   negotiations.^[87]^[88] In December 2011, all the regional groupings on
   the UN Security Council named continued settlement construction and
   settler violence as disruptive to the resumption of talks, a call
   viewed by Russia as a "historic step".^[89]^[90]^[91] In April 2012,
   international outrage followed Israeli steps to further entrench the
   Jewish settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which
   included the publishing of tenders for further settler homes and the
   plan to legalize settler outposts. Britain said that the move was a
   breach of Israeli commitments under the road map to freeze all
   settlement expansion in the land captured since 1967. The British
   Foreign Minister stated that the "Systematic, illegal Israeli
   settlement activity poses the most significant and live threat to the
   viability of the two state solution".^[92] In May 2012 the 27 foreign
   ministers of the European Union issued a statement which condemned
   continued Israeli settler violence and incitement.^[93] In a similar
   move, the Quartet "expressed its concern over ongoing settler violence
   and incitement in the West Bank," calling on Israel "to take effective
   measures, including bringing the perpetrators of such acts to
   justice."^[94] The Palestinian Ma'an News agency reported the PA
   Cabinet's statement on the issue stated that the West, including East
   Jerusalem, were seeing "an escalation in incitement and settler
   violence against our people with a clear protection from the occupation
   military. The last of which was the thousands of settler march in East
   Jerusalem which included slogans inciting to kill, hate and supports
   violence".^[95]

   11 May 2022

   In a report published in February 2014 covering incidents over the
   three-year period of 2011–2013, Amnesty International asserted that
   Israeli forces employed reckless violence in the West Bank, and in some
   instances appeared to engage in wilful killings which would be
   tantamount to war crimes. Besides the numerous fatalities, Amnesty said
   at least 261 Palestinians, including 67 children, had been gravely
   injured by Israeli use of live ammunition. In this same period, 45
   Palestinians, including 6 children had been killed. Amnesty's review of
   25 civilians deaths concluded that in no case was there evidence of the
   Palestinians posing an imminent threat. At the same time, over 8,000
   Palestinians suffered serious injuries from other means, including
   rubber-coated metal bullets. Only one IDF soldier was convicted,
   killing a Palestinian attempting to enter Israel illegally. The soldier
   was demoted and given a 1-year sentence with a five-month suspension.
   The IDF answered the charges stating that its army held itself "to the
   highest of professional standards", adding that when there was
   suspicion of wrongdoing, it investigated and took action "where
   appropriate".^[96]^[97]

  Incitement

   Following the Oslo Accords, which was to set up regulative bodies to
   rein in frictions, Palestinian incitement against Israel, Jews, and
   Zionism continued, parallel with Israel's pursuance of settlements in
   the Palestinian territories,^[98] though under Abu Mazen it has
   reportedly dwindled significantly.^[99] Charges of incitement have been
   reciprocal,^[100]^[101] both sides interpreting media statements in the
   Palestinian and Israeli press as constituting incitement.^[99]
   Schoolbooks published for both Israeli and Palestinian schools have
   been found to have encouraged one-sided narrative and even hatred of
   the other side.^[102]^[103]^[104]^[105]^[106]^[107] Perpetrators of
   murderous attacks, whether against Israelis or Palestinians, often find
   strong vocal support from sections of their communities despite varying
   levels of condemnation from politicians.^[108]^[109]^[110]

   Both parties to the conflict have been criticized by third-parties for
   teaching incitement to their children by downplaying each side's
   historical ties to the area, teaching propagandist maps, or
   indoctrinate their children to one day join the armed
   forces.^[111]^[112]

   The PLO have campaigned for full member status for the state of
   Palestine at the UN and for recognition on the 1967 borders. The
   campaign has received widespread support,^[113]^[114] although it has
   been criticised by the US and Israel for allegedly avoiding bilateral
   negotiation.^[115]^[116] Netanyahu has criticized the Palestinians of
   purportedly trying to bypass direct talks,^[117] whereas Abbas has
   argued that the continued construction of Israeli-Jewish settlements is
   "undermining the realistic potential" for the two-state solution.^[118]
   Although Palestine has been denied full member status by the UN
   Security Council,^[119] in late 2012 the UN General Assembly
   overwhelmingly approved the de facto recognition of sovereign Palestine
   by granting non-member state status.^[120]

  Public attitudes towards peace

   Polling data has produced mixed results regarding the level of support
   among Palestinians for the two-state solution. A poll was carried out
   in 2011 by the Hebrew University; it indicated that support for a
   two-state solution was growing among both Israelis and Palestinians.
   The poll found that 58% of Israelis and 50% of Palestinians supported a
   two-state solution based on the Clinton Parameters, compared with 47%
   of Israelis and 39% of Palestinians in 2003, the first year the poll
   was carried out. The poll also found that an increasing percentage of
   both populations supported an end to violence—63% of Palestinians and
   70% of Israelis expressing their support for an end to violence, an
   increase of 2% for Israelis and 5% for Palestinians from the previous
   year.^[121]

Issues in dispute

   The following outlined positions are the official positions of the two
   parties; however, it is important to note that neither side holds a
   single position. Both the Israeli and the Palestinian sides include
   both moderate and extremist bodies as well as dovish and hawkish
   bodies.

   One of the primary obstacles to resolving the Israeli–Palestinian
   conflict is a deep-set and growing distrust between its participants.
   Unilateral strategies and the rhetoric of hardline political factions,
   coupled with violence and incitements by civilians against one another,
   have fostered mutual embitterment and hostility and a loss of faith in
   the peace process. Support among Palestinians for Hamas is
   considerable, and as its members consistently call for the destruction
   of Israel and violence remains a threat,^[122] security becomes a prime
   concern for many Israelis. The expansion of Israeli settlements in the
   West Bank has led the majority of Palestinians to believe that Israel
   is not committed to reaching an agreement, but rather to a pursuit of
   establishing permanent control over this territory in order to provide
   that security.^[123]

  Status of Jerusalem

   Greater Jerusalem, May 2006. CIA remote sensing map showing what the
   CIA regards as settlements, plus refugee camps, fences, and walls

   The control of Jerusalem is a particularly delicate issue, with each
   side asserting claims over the city. The three largest Abrahamic
   religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—hold Jerusalem as an
   important setting for their religious and historical narratives.
   Jerusalem is the holiest city for Judaism, being the former location of
   the Jewish temples on the Temple Mount and the capital of the ancient
   Israelite kingdom. For Muslims, Jerusalem is the third holiest site,
   being the location of Isra and Mi'raj event, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
   For Christians, Jerusalem is the site of Jesus' crucifixion and the
   Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

   The Israeli government, including the Knesset and Supreme Court, is
   located in the "new city" of West Jerusalem and has been since Israel's
   founding in 1948. After Israel captured the Jordanian-controlled East
   Jerusalem in the Six-Day War, it assumed complete administrative
   control of East Jerusalem. In 1980, Israel passed the Jerusalem Law
   declaring "Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of
   Israel."^[124]^[better source needed]

   Many countries do not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, with
   exceptions being the United States,^[125] and Russia.^[126] The
   majority of UN member states and most international organisations do
   not recognise Israel's claims to East Jerusalem which occurred after
   the 1967 Six-Day War, nor its 1980 Jerusalem Law proclamation.^[127]
   The International Court of Justice in its 2004 Advisory opinion on the
   "Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied
   Palestinian Territory" described East Jerusalem as "occupied
   Palestinian territory".^[128]

   At the Camp David and Taba Summits in 2000–2001, the United States
   proposed a plan in which the Arab parts of Jerusalem would be given to
   the proposed Palestinian state while the Jewish parts of Jerusalem were
   given to Israel. All archaeological work under the Temple Mount would
   be jointly controlled by the Israeli and Palestinian governments. Both
   sides accepted the proposal in principle, but the summits ultimately
   failed.^[129]

  Holy sites and Jerusalem's Temple Mount

   [250px-Klagemauer.JPG] Panorama of the Western Wall with the Dome of
   the Rock (left) and al-Aqsa mosque (right) in the background

   Israel has concerns regarding the welfare of Jewish holy places under
   possible Palestinian control. When Jerusalem was under Jordanian
   control, no Jews were allowed to visit the Western Wall or other Jewish
   holy places, and the Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives was
   desecrated.^[129] Since 1975, Israel has banned Muslims from worshiping
   at Joseph's Tomb, a shrine considered sacred by both Jews and Muslims.
   Settlers established a yeshiva, installed a Torah scroll and covered
   the mihrab. During the Second Intifada the site was looted and
   burned.^[130]^[131] Israeli security agencies routinely monitor and
   arrest Jewish extremists that plan attacks, though many serious
   incidents have still occurred.^[132] Israel has allowed almost complete
   autonomy to the Muslim trust (Waqf) over the Temple Mount.^[129]

   Palestinians have voiced concerns regarding the welfare of Christian
   and Muslim holy places under Israeli control.^[133] Additionally, some
   Palestinian advocates have made statements alleging that the Western
   Wall Tunnel was re-opened with the intent of causing the mosque's
   collapse.^[134]

  Palestinian refugees

   [170px-Woman_nakba_dress_jug.jpg] Palestinian refugees, 1948

   Palestinian refugees are people who lost both their homes and means of
   livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli conflict^[135] and the
   1967 Six-Day War.^[136] The number of Palestinians who fled or were
   expelled from Israel following its creation was estimated at 711,000 in
   1949.^[137] Descendants of these original Palestinian Refugees are also
   eligible for registration and services provided by the United Nations
   Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East
   (UNRWA), and as of 2010 number 4.7 million people.^[138] Between
   350,000 and 400,000 Palestinians were displaced during the 1967
   Arab–Israeli war.^[136] A third of the refugees live in recognized
   refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and the Gaza
   Strip. The remainder live in and around the cities and towns of these
   host countries.^[135]

   Most of these people were born outside Israel, but are descendants of
   original Palestinian refugees.^[135] Palestinian negotiators, such as
   Yasser Arafat, have so far publicly insisted that refugees have a right
   to return to the places where they lived before 1948 and 1967,
   including those within the 1949 Armistice lines, citing the Universal
   Declaration of Human Rights and UN General Assembly Resolution 194 as
   evidence. However, according to reports of private peace negotiations
   with Israel they have countenanced the return of only 10,000 refugees
   and their families to Israel as part of a peace settlement. Mahmoud
   Abbas, the current Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization
   was reported to have said in private discussion that it is "illogical
   to ask Israel to take 5 million, or indeed 1 million. That would mean
   the end of Israel."^[139] In a further interview Abbas stated that he
   no longer had an automatic right to return to Safed in the northern
   Galilee where he was born in 1935. He later clarified that the remark
   was his personal opinion and not official policy.^[140]

   Palestinian and international authors have justified the right of
   return of the Palestinian refugees on several
   grounds:^[141]^[142]^[143] Several scholars included in the broader New
   Historians argue that the Palestinian refugees fled or were chased out
   or expelled by the actions of the Haganah, Lehi and Irgun, Zionist
   paramilitary groups.^[144]^[145] A number have also characterized this
   as an ethnic cleansing.^[146]^[147]^[148]^[149] The New Historians cite
   indications of Arab leaders' desire for the Palestinian Arab population
   to stay put.^[150]

   The Israeli Law of Return that grants citizenship to people of Jewish
   descent is viewed by critics as discriminatory against other ethnic
   groups, especially Palestinians that cannot apply for such citizenship
   under the law of return, to the territory which they were expelled from
   or fled during the course of the 1948 war.^[151]^[152]^[153]

   According to the UN Resolution 194, adopted in 1948, "the refugees
   wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their
   neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable
   date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those
   choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property which,
   under principles of international law or in equity, should be made good
   by the Governments or authorities responsible."^[154] UN Resolution
   3236 "reaffirms also the inalienable right of the Palestinians to
   return to their homes and property from which they have been displaced
   and uprooted, and calls for their return".^[155] Resolution 242 from
   the UN affirms the necessity for "achieving a just settlement of the
   refugee problem"; however, Resolution 242 does not specify that the
   "just settlement" must or should be in the form of a literal
   Palestinian right of return.^[156]

   The most common arguments for opposition are:
    1. On the 18 August 1948, at the United Nations Security Council,
       Israel declared that it is not reasonable to contemplate a return
       of the refugees as the Arab League and the Arab High Committee have
       announced their intentions to continue their war of aggression and
       resume hostilities, noting that the state of war has not been
       lifted and that no peace treaty has been signed. However, Israel
       accepted the next year the return of some of the refugees, notably
       through the annexation of the Gaza Strip or by absorbing 100.000 of
       them in exchange of a peace treaty. The Arab countries refused the
       proposal, demanding a complete return.^[157]
    2. The Palestinian refugee issue is handled by a separate authority
       from that handling other refugees, that is, by UNRWA and not the
       UNHCR. Most of the people recognizing themselves as Palestinian
       refugees would have otherwise been assimilated into their country
       of current residency, and would not maintain their refugee state if
       not for the separate entities.^[158]
    3. Concerning the origin of the Palestinian refugees, the Israeli
       government said that during the 1948 War the Arab Higher Committee
       and the Arab states encouraged Palestinians to flee in order to
       make it easier to rout the Jewish state or that they did so to
       escape the fights by fear.^[citation needed] The Palestinian
       narrative is that refugees were largely expelled and dispossessed
       by Jewish militias and by the Israeli army.

   Historians still debate the causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus.
   Notably, historian Benny Morris states that most of Palestine's 700,000
   refugees fled because of the "flail of war" and expected to return home
   shortly after a successful Arab invasion. He documents instances in
   which Arab leaders advised the evacuation of entire communities as
   happened in Haifa. In his scholarly work, however, he does conclude
   that there were expulsions which were carried out.^[159]^[160] Morris
   considers the displacement the result of a national conflict initiated
   by the Arabs themselves.^[160] In a 2004 interview with Haaretz, he
   described the exodus as largely resulting from an atmosphere of
   transfer that was promoted by Ben-Gurion and understood by the military
   leadership. He also claimed that there "are circumstances in history
   that justify ethnic cleansing".^[161] He has been criticized by
   political scientist Norman Finkelstein for having seemingly changed his
   views for political, rather than historical, reasons.^[162]

   Since Jewish people who fled or otherwise emigrated from the Arab world
   after the Israeli declaration of independence were never compensated or
   repatriated by their former countries of residence—to no objection on
   the part of Arab leaders—a precedent has been set whereby it is the
   responsibility of the nation which accepts the refugees to assimilate
   them.^[163]^[164]^[165]
   [220px-Shatila_-_street_view_%282%29.jpg] Shatila refugee camp on the
   outskirts of Beirut in May 2019

   Although Israel accepts the right of the Palestinian Diaspora to return
   into a new Palestinian state, Israel insists that the return of this
   population into the current state of Israel would be a great danger for
   the stability of the Jewish state; an influx of Palestinian refugees
   would lead to the destruction of the state of Israel.^[166]

   According to Efraim Karsh the Palestinians were themselves the
   aggressors in the 1948–1949 war who attempted to "cleanse" a
   neighboring ethnic community. Had the United Nations resolution of 29
   November 1947 recommending partition in Palestine not been subverted by
   force by the Arab world, there would have been no refugee problem in
   the first place. He reports of large numbers of Palestinian refugees
   leaving even before the outbreak of the 1948 war because of
   disillusionment and economic privation. The British High Commissioner
   for Palestine spoke of the "collapsing Arab morale in Palestine" that
   he partially attributed to the "increasing tendency of those who should
   be leading them to leave the country" and the considerable evacuations
   of the Arab effendi class. Huge numbers of Palestinians were also
   expelled by their leadership to prevent them from becoming Israeli
   citizens and in Haifa and Tiberias, tens of thousands of Arabs were
   forcibly evacuated on the instructions of the Arab Higher
   Committee.^[167]

  Israeli security concerns

   Authority, Palestinian political violence, and 2010 Palestinian
   militancy campaign

   [220px-Terror_Strikes_Israeli_Civilians_in_Southern_Israel.jpg] Remains
   of an Egged bus hit by suicide bomber in the aftermath of the 2011
   southern Israel cross-border attacks. Eight people were killed, about
   40 were injured.

   Throughout the conflict, Palestinian violence has been a concern for
   Israelis. Israel,^[168] along with the United
   States^[169]^[better source needed] and the European Union, refer to
   the violence against Israeli civilians and military forces by
   Palestinian militants as terrorism. The motivations behind Palestinian
   violence against Israeli civilians are many, and not all violent
   Palestinian groups agree with each other on specifics. Nonetheless, a
   common motive is the desire to destroy Israel and replace it with a
   Palestinian Arab state.^[170] The most prominent Islamist groups, such
   as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, view the Israeli–Palestinian
   conflict as a religious jihad.^[171]

   Suicide bombings have been used as a tactic among Palestinian
   organizations like Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs
   Brigade and certain suicide attacks have received support among
   Palestinians as high as 84%.^[172]^[173] In Israel, Palestinian suicide
   bombers have targeted civilian buses, restaurants, shopping malls,
   hotels and marketplaces.^[174] From 1993 to 2003, 303 Palestinian
   suicide bombers attacked Israel.

   The Israeli government initiated the construction of a security barrier
   following scores of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks in July
   2003. Israel's coalition government approved the security barrier in
   the northern part of the green line between Israel and the West Bank.
   According to the IDF, since the erection of the fence, terrorist acts
   have declined by approximately 90%.^[175]

   Since 2001, the threat of Qassam rockets fired from Palestinian
   territories into Israel continues to be of great concern for Israeli
   defense officials.^[176] In 2006—the year following Israel's
   disengagement from the Gaza Strip—the Israeli government claimed to
   have recorded 1,726 such launches, more than four times the total
   rockets fired in 2005.^[168]^[177] As of January 2009, over 8,600
   rockets have been launched,^[178]^[179] causing widespread
   psychological trauma and disruption of daily life.^[180] Over 500
   rockets and mortars hit Israel in January–September 2010 and over 1,947
   rockets hit Israel in January–November 2012.

   According to a study conducted by University of Haifa, one in five
   Israelis have lost a relative or friend in a Palestinian terrorist
   attack.^[181]

   There is significant debate within Israel about how to deal with the
   country's security concerns. Options have included military action
   (including targeted killings and house demolitions of terrorist
   operatives), diplomacy, unilateral gestures toward peace, and increased
   security measures such as checkpoints, roadblocks and security
   barriers. The legality and the wisdom of all of the above tactics have
   been called into question by various commentators.^[14]^[unreliable
   source?]

   Since mid-June 2007, Israel's primary means of dealing with security
   concerns in the West Bank has been to cooperate with and permit United
   States-sponsored training, equipping, and funding of the Palestinian
   Authority's security forces, which with Israeli help have largely
   succeeded in quelling West Bank supporters of Hamas.^[182]

  Palestinian violence outside of Israel

   Some Palestinians have committed violent acts over the globe on the
   pretext of a struggle against Israel.^[183]^[184]

   During the late 1960s, the PLO became increasingly infamous for its use
   of international terror. In 1969 alone, the PLO was responsible for
   hijacking 82 planes. El Al Airlines became a regular hijacking
   target.^[185]^[186] The hijacking of Air France Flight 139 by the
   Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine culminated during a
   hostage-rescue mission, where Israeli special forces successfully
   rescued the majority of the hostages.

   However, one of the most well-known and notorious terrorist acts was
   the capture and eventual murder of 11 Israeli athletes during the 1972
   Olympic Games.^[187]

  Palestinian-on-Palestinian violence

   [220px-2013_Fatah_anniversary_rally_in_Gaza_%2804%29.jpg] A
   demonstration in support of Fatah in Gaza City in January 2013

   Fighting among rival Palestinian and Arab movements has played a
   crucial role in shaping Israel's security policy towards Palestinian
   militants, as well as in the Palestinian leadership's own
   policies.^[citation needed] As early as the 1930s revolts in Palestine,
   Arab forces fought each other while also skirmishing with Zionist and
   British forces, and internal conflicts continue to the present day.
   During the Lebanese Civil War, Palestinian baathists broke from the
   Palestine Liberation Organization and allied with the Shia Amal
   Movement, fighting a bloody civil war that killed thousands of
   Palestinians.^[188]^[189]

   In the First Intifada, more than a thousand Palestinians were killed in
   a campaign initiated by the Palestine Liberation Organization to crack
   down on suspected Israeli security service informers and collaborators.
   The Palestinian Authority was strongly criticized for its treatment of
   alleged collaborators, rights groups complaining that those labeled
   collaborators were denied fair trials. According to a report released
   by the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group, less than 45 percent
   of those killed were actually guilty of informing for Israel.^[190]

   In the Gaza Strip, Hamas officials have tortured and killed thousands
   of Fatah members and other Palestinians who oppose their rule. During
   the Battle of Gaza, more than 150 Palestinians died over a four-day
   period.^[191] The violence among Palestinians was described as a civil
   war by some commentators. By 2007, more than 600 Palestinian people had
   died during the struggle between Hamas and Fatah.^[192]

   [210px-Restricted_space_in_the_West_Bank%2C_Area_C.png] Area C,
   controlled by Israel under Oslo Accords, in blue and red, in December
   2011

   As far as Israel is concerned, the jurisdiction of the Palestinian
   Authority is derived from the Oslo Accords, signed with the PLO, under
   which it acquired control over cities in the Palestinian territories
   (Area A) while the surrounding countryside came either under Israeli
   security and Palestinian civil administration (Area B) or complete
   Israeli civil administration (Area C). Israel has built additional
   highways to allow Israelis to traverse the area without entering
   Palestinian cities in Area A. The initial areas under Palestinian
   Authority control are diverse and non-contiguous. The areas have
   changed over time by subsequent negotiations, including Oslo II, Wye
   River and Sharm el-Sheik. According to Palestinians, the separated
   areas make it impossible to create a viable nation and fails to address
   Palestinian security needs; Israel has expressed no agreement to
   withdrawal from some Areas B, resulting in no reduction in the division
   of the Palestinian areas, and the institution of a safe pass system,
   without Israeli checkpoints, between these parts.

   Under the Oslo Accords, as a security measure, Israel has insisted on
   its control over all land, sea and air border crossings into the
   Palestinian territories, and the right to set import and export
   controls. This is to enable Israel to control the entry into the
   territories of materials of military significance and of potentially
   dangerous persons.

   The PLO's objective for international recognition of the State of
   Palestine is considered by Israel as a provocative "unilateral" act
   that is inconsistent with the Oslo Accords.

  Water resources

   Further information: Water supply and sanitation in the Palestinian
   territories and Water politics in the Jordan River basin

   In the Middle East, water resources are of great political concern.
   Since Israel receives much of its water from two large underground
   aquifers which continue under the Green Line, the use of this water has
   been contentious in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Israel withdraws
   most water from these areas, but it also supplies the West Bank with
   approximately 40 million cubic metres annually, contributing to 77% of
   Palestinians' water supply in the West Bank, which is to be shared for
   a population of about 2.6 million.^[193]
   [220px-Water_supply_in_West_Bank_and_Gaza_February_2014_5water_photoblo
   g.jpg] Palestinian villagers purchase water from water trucks in
   Khirbet A-Duqaiqah in the Hebron Hills[220px-Ma%27ale_adumim_02.JPG] A
   swimming pool in the Israeli settlement of Ma'ale Adumim, West Bank

   While Israel's consumption of this water has decreased since it began
   its occupation of the West Bank, it still consumes the majority of it:
   in the 1950s, Israel consumed 95% of the water output of the Western
   Aquifer, and 82% of that produced by the Northeastern Aquifer. Although
   this water was drawn entirely on Israel's own side of the pre-1967
   border, the sources of the water are nevertheless from the shared
   groundwater basins located under both West Bank and Israel.^[194]

   In the Oslo II Accord, both sides agreed to maintain "existing
   quantities of utilization from the resources." In so doing, the
   Palestinian Authority established the legality of Israeli water
   production in the West Bank, subject to a Joint Water Committee (JWC).
   Moreover, Israel obligated itself in this agreement to provide water to
   supplement Palestinian production, and further agreed to allow
   additional Palestinian drilling in the Eastern Aquifer, also subject to
   the Joint Water Committee.^[195]^[196] The water that Israel receives
   comes mainly from the Jordan River system, the Sea of Galilee and two
   underground sources. According to a 2003 BBC article the Palestinians
   lack access to the Jordan River system.^[197]

   According to a report of 2008 by the Food and Agriculture Organization
   of the United Nations, water resources were confiscated for the benefit
   of the Israeli settlements in the Ghor. Palestinian irrigation pumps on
   the Jordan River were destroyed or confiscated after the 1967 war and
   Palestinians were not allowed to use water from the Jordan River
   system. Furthermore, the authorities did not allow any new irrigation
   wells to be drilled by Palestinian farmers, while it provided fresh
   water and allowed drilling wells for irrigation purposes at the Jewish
   settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.^[198]

   A report was released by the UN in August 2012 and Max Gaylard, the UN
   Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in the occupied Palestinian
   territory, explained at the launch of the publication: "Gaza will have
   half a million more people by 2020 while its economy will grow only
   slowly. In consequence, the people of Gaza will have an even harder
   time getting enough drinking water and electricity, or sending their
   children to school". Gaylard present alongside Jean Gough, of the UN
   Children's Fund (UNICEF), and Robert Turner, of the UN Relief and Works
   Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The report
   projects that Gaza's population will increase from 1.6 million people
   to 2.1 million people in 2020, leading to a density of more than 5,800
   people per square kilometre.^[199]

    Future and financing

   Numerous foreign nations and international organizations have
   established bilateral agreements with the Palestinian and Israeli water
   authorities. It was estimated that a future investment of about
   US$1.1bn for the West Bank and $0.8bn for the Gaza Strip Southern
   Governorates was needed for the planning period from 2003 to
   2015.^[200]

   In late 2012, a donation of $21.6 million was announced by the
   Government of the Netherlands—the Dutch government stated that the
   funds would be provided to the UN Relief and Works Agency for
   Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), for the specific benefit
   of Palestinian children. An article, published by the UN News website,
   stated that: "Of the $21.6 million, $5.7 will be allocated to UNRWA's
   2012 Emergency Appeal for the occupied Palestinian territory, which
   will support programmes in the West Bank and Gaza aiming to mitigate
   the effects on refugees of the deteriorating situation they
   face."^[199]

  Israeli occupation of the West Bank

   Occupied Palestinian Territory is the term used by the United Nations
   to refer to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza
   Strip—territories which were captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day
   War, having formerly been controlled by Egypt and Jordan.^[201]

   In 1980, Israel annexed East Jerusalem.^[202] Israel has never annexed
   the West Bank, apart from East Jerusalem, or Gaza Strip, and the United
   Nations has demanded the "[t]ermination of all claims or states of
   belligerency and respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty,
   territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the
   area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized
   boundaries free from threats or acts of force" and that Israeli forces
   withdraw "from territories occupied in the recent conflict" – the
   meaning and intent of the latter phrase is disputed. See
   Interpretations.

   It has been the position of Israel that the most Arab-populated parts
   of West Bank (without major Jewish settlements), as well as the entire
   Gaza Strip, must eventually be part of an independent Palestinian
   State; however, the precise borders of this state are in question. At
   Camp David, for example, then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered
   Arafat an opportunity to establish a non-militarized Palestinian State.
   The proposed state would consist of 77% of the West Bank split into two
   or three areas, followed by: an increase of 86–91% of the West Bank
   after six to twenty-one years; autonomy, but not sovereignty for some
   of the Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem surrounded by Israeli
   territory; the entire Gaza Strip; and the dismantling of most
   settlements.^[55] Arafat rejected the proposal without providing a
   counter-offer.

   A subsequent settlement proposed by President Clinton offered
   Palestinian sovereignty over 94 to 96 percent of the West Bank but was
   similarly rejected with 52 objections.^[54]^[203]^[204]^[12] The Arab
   League has agreed to the principle of minor and mutually agreed
   land-swaps as part of a negotiated two state settlement based in June
   1967 borders.^[205] Official U.S. policy also reflects the ideal of
   using the 1967 borders as a basis for an eventual peace
   agreement.^[206]^[207]

   Some Palestinians say they are entitled to all of the West Bank, Gaza
   Strip, and East Jerusalem. Israel says it is justified in not ceding
   all this land, because of security concerns, and also because the lack
   of any valid diplomatic agreement at the time means that ownership and
   boundaries of this land is open for discussion.^[208] Palestinians
   claim any reduction of this claim is a severe deprivation of their
   rights. In negotiations, they claim that any moves to reduce the
   boundaries of this land is a hostile move against their key interests.
   Israel considers this land to be in dispute and feels the purpose of
   negotiations is to define what the final borders will be. In 2017 Hamas
   announced that it was ready to support a Palestinian state on the 1967
   borders "without recognising Israel or ceding any rights".^[209] Hamas
   has previously viewed the peace process "as religiously forbidden and
   politically inconceivable".^[171]

    Israeli settlements

   Main article: Israeli settlement

   [260px-MaaleAdummim_red-roof.JPG] A neighbourhood in Ariel, home to the
   Ariel University

   According to the Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Affairs
   (DEMA), "In the years following the Six-Day War, and especially in the
   1990s during the peace process, Israel re-established communities
   destroyed in 1929 and 1948 as well as established numerous new
   settlements in the West Bank."^[210] These settlements were, as of
   2009, home to about 301,000 people.^[211] DEMA added, "Most of the
   settlements are in the western parts of the West Bank, while others are
   deep into Palestinian territory, overlooking Palestinian cities. These
   settlements have been the site of much inter-communal conflict."^[210]
   The issue of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and, until 2005, the
   Gaza Strip, have been described by the UK^[212] and the WEU^[213] as an
   obstacle to the peace process. The United Nations and the European
   Union have also called the settlements "illegal under international
   law."^[214]^[215]

   However, Israel disputes this;^[216] several scholars and commentators
   disagree with the assessment that settlements are illegal, citing in
   2005 recent historical trends to back up their argument.^[217]^[218]
   Those who justify the legality of the settlements use arguments based
   upon Articles 2 and 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, as well as UN
   Security Council Resolution 242.^[219]^[better source needed] On a
   practical level, some objections voiced by Palestinians are that
   settlements divert resources needed by Palestinian towns, such as
   arable land, water, and other resources; and, that settlements reduce
   Palestinians' ability to travel freely via local roads, owing to
   security considerations.^[citation needed]

   Former US President George W. Bush has stated that he does not expect
   Israel to return entirely to the 1949 armistice lines because of "new
   realities on the ground".^[220] One of the main compromise plans put
   forth by the Clinton Administration would have allowed Israel to keep
   some settlements in the West Bank, especially those which were in large
   blocs near the pre-1967 borders of Israel. In return, Palestinians
   would have received some concessions of land in other parts of the
   country.^[citation needed] The Obama administration viewed a complete
   freeze of construction in settlements on the West Bank as a critical
   step toward peace. In May and June 2009, President Barack Obama said,
   "The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli
   settlements",^[221] and the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, stated
   that the President "wants to see a stop to settlements—not some
   settlements, not outposts, not 'natural growth' exceptions."^[222]
   However, Obama has since declared that the United States will no longer
   press Israel to stop West Bank settlement construction as a
   precondition for continued peace-process negotiations with the
   Palestinian Authority.^[223]

   As of 2023, there were about 500,000 Israeli settlers living in the
   West Bank, with another 200,000 living in East
   Jerusalem.^[224]^[225]^[226] In February 2023, Israel's Finance
   Minister Bezalel Smotrich took charge of most of the Civil
   Administration, obtaining broad authority over civilian issues in the
   West Bank.^[227]^[228] In the first six months of 2023, 13,000 housing
   units were built in settlements, which is almost three times more than
   in the whole of 2022.^[229]

  Blockade of the Gaza Strip

   Main article: Blockade of the Gaza Strip

   [220px-Gazaday14.JPG] Israel's attack on Gaza in 2009

   The Israeli government states it is justified under international law
   to impose a blockade on an enemy for security reasons. The power to
   impose a naval blockade is established under customary international
   law and Laws of armed conflict, and a United Nations commission has
   ruled that Israel's blockade is "both legal and
   appropriate."^[230]^[231] The Israeli Government's continued land, sea
   and air blockage is tantamount to collective punishment of the
   population, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination
   of Humanitarian Affairs.^[232] The Military Advocate General of Israel
   has provided numerous reasonings for the policy:

     The State of Israel has been engaged in an ongoing armed conflict
     with terrorist organizations operating in the Gaza strip. This armed
     conflict has intensified after Hamas violently took over Gaza, in
     June 2007, and turned the territory under its de facto control into
     a launching pad of mortar and rocket attacks against Israeli towns
     and villages in southern Israel.^[233]

   According to Oxfam, because of an import-export ban imposed on Gaza in
   2007, 95% of Gaza's industrial operations were suspended. Out of 35,000
   people employed by 3,900 factories in June 2005, only 1,750 people
   remained employed by 195 factories in June 2007.^[234] By 2010, Gaza's
   unemployment rate had risen to 40% with 80% of the population living on
   less than 2 dollars a day.^[235]
   [450px-Rocket_Attacks_fired_at_Israel_from_the_Gaza_Strip_by_year.png]
   Rocket attacks fired at Israel from the Gaza Strip, 2001-2021^[236]

   In January 2008, the Israeli government calculated how many calories
   per person were needed to prevent a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza
   strip, and then subtracted eight percent to adjust for the "culture and
   experience" of the Gazans. Details of the calculations were released
   following Israeli human rights organization Gisha's application to the
   high court. Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the
   Territories, who drafted the plan, stated that the scheme was never
   formally adopted, this was not accepted by Gisha.^[237]^[238]^[239]

   Starting in February 2008, the Israeli Government reduced the
   electricity it sells directly to Gaza. This follows the ruling of
   Israel's High Court of Justice's decision, which held, with respect to
   the amount of industrial fuel supplied to Gaza, that, "The
   clarification that we made indicates that the supply of industrial
   diesel fuel to the Gaza Strip in the winter months of last year was
   comparable to the amount that the Respondents now undertake to allow
   into the Gaza Strip. This fact also indicates that the amount is
   reasonable and sufficient to meet the vital humanitarian needs in the
   Gaza Strip." Palestinian militants killed two Israelis in the process
   of delivering fuel to the Nahal Oz fuel depot.^[240]

   With regard to Israel's plan, the Court stated that, "calls for a
   reduction of five percent of the power supply in three of the ten power
   lines that supply electricity from Israel to the Gaza Strip, to a level
   of 13.5 megawatts in two of the lines and 12.5 megawatts in the third
   line, we [the Court] were convinced that this reduction does not breach
   the humanitarian obligations imposed on the State of Israel in the
   framework of the armed conflict being waged between it and the Hamas
   organization that controls the Gaza Strip. Our conclusion is based, in
   part, on the affidavit of the Respondents indicating that the relevant
   Palestinian officials stated that they can reduce the load in the event
   limitations are placed on the power lines, and that they had used this
   capability in the past."

   On 20 June 2010, Israel's Security Cabinet approved a new system
   governing the blockade that would allow practically all non-military or
   dual-use items to enter the Gaza strip. According to a cabinet
   statement, Israel would "expand the transfer of construction materials
   designated for projects that have been approved by the Palestinian
   Authority, including schools, health institutions, water, sanitation
   and more – as well as (projects) that are under international
   supervision."^[241] Despite the easing of the land blockade, Israel
   will continue to inspect all goods bound for Gaza by sea at the port of
   Ashdod.^[242]

   Prior to a Gaza visit, scheduled for April 2013, Turkey's Prime
   Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan explained to Turkish newspaper Hürriyet
   that the fulfilment of three conditions by Israel was necessary for
   friendly relations to resume between Turkey and Israel: an apology for
   the May 2010 Gaza flotilla raid (Prime Minister Netanyahu had delivered
   an apology to Erdogan by telephone on 22 March 2013), the awarding of
   compensation to the families affected by the raid, and the lifting of
   the Gaza blockade by Israel. The Turkish prime minister also explained
   in the Hürriyet interview, in relation to the April 2013 Gaza visit,
   "We will monitor the situation to see if the promises are kept or
   not."^[243] At the same time, Netanyahu affirmed that Israel would only
   consider exploring the removal of the Gaza blockade if peace ("quiet")
   is achieved in the area.^[244]

   On 9 October 2023, Israel declared war on Hamas and imposed a "total
   blockade" of the Gaza Strip.^[245] The blockade was announced by
   Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who declared: "There will be no
   electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed. We are fighting
   human animals and we are acting accordingly."^[246]^[247]

  Agricultural rights

   See also: Economy of the State of Palestine § Israeli–Palestinian
   relations

   Since the beginning of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, the conflict
   has been about land.^[248] When Israel became a state after the war in
   1948, 77% of Palestine's land was used for the creation on the
   state.^[249] The majority of those living in Palestine at the time
   became refugees in other countries and this first land crisis became
   the root of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.^[250] Because the root of
   the conflict is with land, the disputes between Israel and Palestine
   are well-manifested in the agriculture of Palestine.

   In Palestine, agriculture is a mainstay in the economy. The production
   of agricultural goods supports the population's sustenance needs and
   fuels Palestine's export economy.^[251] According to the Council for
   European Palestinian Relations, the agricultural sector formally
   employs 13.4% of the population and informally employs 90% of the
   population.^[251] Over the past 10 years^[when?], unemployment rates in
   Palestine have increased and the agricultural sector became the most
   impoverished sector in Palestine. Unemployment rates peaked in 2008
   when they reached 41% in Gaza.^[252]

   Palestinian agriculture suffers from numerous problems including
   Israeli military and civilian attacks on farms and farmers, blockades
   to exportation of produce and importation of necessary inputs,
   widespread confiscation of land for nature reserves as well as military
   and settler use, confiscation and destruction of wells, and physical
   barriers within the West Bank.^[253]

  Israel's West Bank barrier

   [220px-Holy_Land_2022_%281%29_P473_Bethlehem_barrier.jpg] The barrier
   between Israel and Palestine

   With the construction of the separation barrier, the Israeli state
   promised free movement across regions. However, border closures,
   curfews, and checkpoints has significantly restricted Palestinian
   movement.^[254] In 2012, there were 99 fixed check points and 310
   flying checkpoints.^[255] The border restrictions impacted the imports
   and exports in Palestine and weakened the industrial and agricultural
   sectors because of the constant Israeli control in the West Bank and
   Gaza.^[256] In order for the Palestinian economy to be prosperous, the
   restrictions on Palestinian land must be removed.^[253] According to
   The Guardian and a report for World Bank, the Palestinian economy lost
   $3.4bn (%35 of the annual GDP) to Israeli restrictions in the West Bank
   alone.^[257]

  Economic disputes and boycotts

   See also: Economy of the Palestinian territories and Boycott,
   Divestment, and Sanctions

   In Gaza, the agricultural market suffers from economic boycotts and
   border closures and restrictions placed by Israel.^[258] The PA's
   Minister of Agriculture estimates that around US$1.2 billion were lost
   in September 2006 because of these security measures. There has also
   been an economic embargo initiated by the west on Hamas-led Palestine,
   which has decreased the amount of imports and exports from
   Palestine.^[citation needed] This embargo was brought on by Hamas'
   refusal to recognize Israel's right to statehood.^[citation needed] As
   a result, the PA's 160,000 employees have not received their salaries
   in over one year.^[259]

Actions toward stabilizing the conflict

   In response to a weakening trend in Palestinian violence and growing
   economic and security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian
   Authority, the Israeli military removed over 120 check points in 2010
   and planned on disengaging from major Palestinian population areas.
   According to the IDF, terrorist activity in the West Bank decreased by
   97% compared to violence in 2002.^[260]

   PA–Israel efforts in the West Bank have "significantly increased
   investor confidence", and the Palestinian economy grew 6.8% in
   2009.^[261]^[262]^[263]^[264]
   [200px-Bank_Of_Palestine_-_Ramallah.jpg] Bank of Palestine

   Since the Second Intifada, Israel has banned Jewish Israelis from
   entering Palestinian cities. However, Israeli Arabs are allowed to
   enter West Bank cities on weekends.

   The Palestinian Authority has petitioned the Israeli military to allow
   Jewish tourists to visit West Bank cities as "part of an effort" to
   improve the Palestinian economy. Israeli general Avi Mizrahi spoke with
   Palestinian security officers while touring malls and soccer fields in
   the West Bank. Mizrahi gave permission to allow Israeli tour guides
   into Bethlehem, a move intended to "contribute to the Palestinian and
   Israeli economies."^[265]

  Mutual recognition

   Main article: Israel–PLO Letters of Mutual Recognition

    Between Israel and the PLO

   Beginning in 1993 with the Oslo peace process, Israel recognizes "the
   PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people", though Israel
   does not recognize the State of Palestine.^[266] In return, it was
   agreed that Palestinians would promote peaceful co-existence, renounce
   violence and promote recognition of Israel among their own people.
   Despite Yasser Arafat's official renunciation of terrorism and
   recognition of Israel, some Palestinian groups continue to practice and
   advocate violence against civilians and do not recognize Israel as a
   legitimate political entity.^[26]^[267]^[unreliable source?]
   Palestinians state that their ability to spread acceptance of Israel
   was greatly hampered by Israeli restrictions on Palestinian political
   freedoms, economic freedoms, civil liberties, and quality of life.

    Of Israel as a Jewish state

   The Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas has in recent years refused to
   recognize Israel as a Jewish state, citing concerns for Israeli Arabs
   and a possible future right to return for Palestinian refugees, though
   Palestine continues to recognize Israel as a state.^[268]^[269]

   This article needs to be updated. Please help update this article to
   reflect recent events or newly available information. (January 2023)

   The leader of al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, which is Fatah's official
   military wing, has stated that any peace agreement must include the
   right of return of Palestinian refugees into lands now part of Israel,
   which some Israeli commenters view as "destroying the Jewish
   state".^[270] In 2006, Hamas won a majority in the Palestinian
   Legislative Council, where it remains the majority party. Hamas'
   charter openly states they seek Israel's destruction, though Hamas
   leaders have spoken of long-term truces with Israel in exchange for an
   end to the occupation of Palestinian territory.^[267]^[271]

  Palestinian government

   [220px-West_Bank_Access_Restrictions_%28United_Nations_OCHA_oPt%29_May_
   2023.jpg] Palestinian enclaves in May 2023 (Area A and B under the Oslo
   II Accord). Area A (light yellow) is exclusively administered by the
   Fatah-controlled Palestinian Authority.

   The Palestinian Authority is considered corrupt by a wide variety of
   sources, including some Palestinians.^[272]^[273]^[274] Some Israelis
   argue that it provides tacit support for militants via its relationship
   with Hamas and other Islamic militant movements, and that therefore it
   is unsuitable for governing any putative Palestinian state or
   (especially according to the right wing of Israeli politics), even
   negotiating about the character of such a state.^[208] Because of that,
   a number of organizations, including the previously ruling Likud party,
   declared they would not accept a Palestinian state based on the current
   PA.

    Palestinian security apparatus

   Starting in 2006, the United States began training, equipping, and
   funding the Palestinian Authority's security forces, which had been
   cooperating with Israel at unprecedented levels in the West Bank to
   quell supporters of Hamas.^[182] The US government has spent over $500
   million building and training the Palestinian National Security Forces
   and Presidential Guard.^[182] The IDF maintains that the US-trained
   forces will soon be capable of "overrunning small IDF outposts and
   isolated Israeli communities" in the event of a conflict.^[275]

  Views on dialogue versus violence

   Societal attitudes in both Israel and Palestine are a source of concern
   to those promoting dispute resolution.

   According to a June 2022 poll carried out by the Palestinian Center for
   Policy and Survey Research that asked Palestinians from the Gaza Strip
   and the West Bank including East Jerusalem, "which of the following
   means is the most effective means of ending the Israeli occupation and
   building an independent state", 50% supported "armed struggle", 22%
   favored negotiations until an agreement could be reached, and 21%
   supported non-violent popular resistance.^[18] 59% of respondents cite
   the armed attack inside Israel carried out by Palestinians unaffiliated
   with known armed groups as contributing to ending the occupation; 37%
   disagree. Residents of the Gaza Strip, youth, students, low-income
   workers, public sector employees, and Hamas supporters are more likely
   to believe that armed attacks contribute to the national interest.^[18]
   An unconditional resumption of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations is
   opposed by 69% of Palestinians and supported by 22%. A return to
   dialogue with the new US administration under Joe Biden is opposed by
   65% of Palestinians, while 29% are in favor.^[18]

Fatalities

   See also: Israeli casualties of war and Palestinian casualties of war

   A variety of studies provide aggregated casualty data for the
   Israeli–Palestinian conflict. According to the Stockholm International
   Peace Research Institute, 13,000 Israelis and Palestinians were killed
   in conflict with each other between 1948 and 1997.^[276] Other
   estimations give 14,500 killed between 1948 and 2009.^[276]^[277]
   Palestinian fatalities during the 1982 Lebanon War were 2,000 PLO
   combatants killed in armed conflict with Israel.^[278]

   According to B'tselem, during the first intifada from 1987 until 2000,
   1,551 Palestinians and 421 Israelis lost their lives.^[279] According
   to the database of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of
   Humanitarian Affairs - occupied Palestinian territory (OCHAoPt), 6,407
   Palestinians and 308 Israelis were killed in the ongoing
   Israeli–Palestinian conflict from 2008 to September 2023, before the
   2023 Israel–Hamas war.^[280]^[281]

   Figures include both Israeli civilians and security forces casualties
   in West Bank, Gaza and Israel. All numbers refer to casualties of
   direct conflict between Israelis and Palestinians including in IDF
   military operations, artillery shelling, search and arrest campaigns,
   barrier demonstrations, targeted killings, settler violence etc. The
   figures do not include events indirectly related to the conflict such
   as casualties from unexploded ordnance, etc., or events when the
   circumstances remain unclear or are in dispute. The figures include all
   reported casualties of all ages and both genders.^[283]

  Criticism of casualty statistics

   As reported by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, since 29
   September 2000 a total of 7,454 Palestinian and Israeli individuals
   were killed due to the conflict. According to the report, 1,317 of the
   6,371 Palestinians were minors, and at least 2,996 did not participate
   in fighting at the time of death. Palestinians killed 1,083 Israelis,
   including 741 civilians, of whom 124 were minors.^[285]

   The Israeli-based International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism
   criticized the methodology of Israeli and Palestinian rights groups,
   including B'Tselem, and questioned their accuracy in classifying
   civilian/combatant ratios.^[286]^[287]

  Landmines and unexploded ordnance

   A comprehensive collection mechanism to gather land mine and explosive
   remnants of war (ERW) casualty data does not exist for the Palestinian
   territories.^[288] In 2009, the United Nations Mine Action Centre
   reported that more than 2,500 mine and explosive remnants of war
   casualties occurred between 1967 and 1998, at least 794 casualties (127
   killed, 654 injured and 13 unknown) occurred between 1999 and 2008 and
   that 12 people had been killed and 27 injured since the Gaza War.^[288]
   The UN Mine Action Centre identified the main risks as coming from "ERW
   left behind by Israeli aerial and artillery weapon systems, or from
   militant caches targeted by the Israeli forces."^[288] There are at
   least 15 confirmed minefields in the West Bank on the border with
   Jordan. The Palestinian National Security Forces do not have maps or
   records of the minefields.^[288]

Explanatory notes

    1. ^ Three factors made Israel's territorial offer less forthcoming
       than it initially appeared. First, the 91 percent land offer was
       based on the Israeli definition of the West Bank, but this differs
       by approximately 5 percentage points from the Palestinian
       definition. Palestinians use a total area of 5,854 square
       kilometers. Israel, however, omits the area known as No Man's Land
       (50 km^2 near Latrun), post-1967 East Jerusalem (71 km^2), and the
       territorial waters of the Dead Sea (195 km^2), which reduces the
       total to 5,538 km^2. Thus, an Israeli offer of 91 percent (of
       5,538 km^2 of the West Bank translates into only 86 percent from
       the Palestinian perspective.

   The Law of Return, which determines the second-class citizenship of
   Palestinians, is recognized as a fundamental principle in Israel and
   "is possibly even its very raison d'etre as a Jewish state."19"

   discriminatory effect for Palestinian Arab people since it allows any
   Jew to immigrate to Israel, while – at the same time – it deprives all
   native Palestinian Arab refugees residing outside the borders of the

   the 1948 war that broke out because of the establishment of Israel."

   heading of "Discrimination", the Committee cited Israel's Law of Return
   as discriminatory against Palestinian refugees because of Israel's
   refusal to readmit them. The committee said: "The Committee notes with
   concern that the Law of Return which permits any Jew from anywhere in
   the world to immigrate and thereby virtually automatically enjoy
   residence and obtain citizenship in Israel, discriminates against
   Palestinians in the Diaspora upon whom the Government of Israel has
   imposed restrictive requirements that make it almost impossible to
