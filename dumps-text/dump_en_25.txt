     * Ukrainian forces have secured a foothold on the east bank of the
       Dnipro River in southern Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of
       staff was quoted as saying. Andriy Yermak’s remarks were the first
       official acknowledgment that Ukrainian troops were established on
       the Dnipro’s east bank in Kherson region, Reuters reported.
     * A top Ukrainian military official has said Russian troops have
       continued simultaneous assault attempts in several directions on
       the country’s east, and are increasing the use of kamikaze drones,
       Reuters reported. The head of Ukraine’s ground forces, Gen
       Oleksandr Syrskyi, said that Russia, despite high losses, has been
       attacking Ukrainian positions near Kupiansk. “In addition, the
       enemy has increased the use of kamikaze drones,” he said on
       Telegram.
     * Serhiy Lysak, the governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, said
       Russia had hit Nikopol region 11 times on Tuesday, using kamikaze
       drones and artillery. He wrote on Telegram that the district centre
       was most heavily targeted and that a 26-year-old man died.
     * The former detective Sergei Khadzhikurbanov, convicted for his role
       in the 2006 killing of investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya,
       has been pardoned after fighting in Ukraine, his lawyer said. “As a
       special forces fighter, he was invited to sign a contract to
       participate in the special military operation … When the contract
       expired, he was pardoned by presidential decree,” lawyer Alexei
       Mikhalchik told AFP.
     * Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said Russia is
       increasing its attacks across the frontline, AFP reported. “The
       military reported an increase in the number of enemy assaults,”
       Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram on Tuesday, saying Russian forces were
       attacking around Donetsk, Kupiansk and Avdiivka.
     * The former detective Sergei Khadzhikurbanov, convicted for his role
       in the 2006 killing of investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya,
       has been pardoned after fighting in Ukraine, his lawyer said. “As a
       special forces fighter, he was invited to sign a contract to
       participate in the special military operation … When the contract
       expired, he was pardoned by presidential decree,” lawyer Alexei
       Mikhalchik told AFP.
     * Vladimir Putin has approved changes to the law that governs
       presidential elections by putting new restrictions on media
       coverage, local news agencies reported.
     * The EU will miss its target of supplying Ukraine with 1m artillery
       shells and missiles by next March, the German defence minister
       said. Boris Pistorius’s comments, the first public admission by a
       senior European minister that the target would not be met, were
       made before a summit of EU defence ministers in Brussels on
       Wednesday.
     * Russian shelling on Monday damaged a hospital and homes in the
       southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, killing three people and
       injuring at least 12, local governor Oleksandr Prokudin said.
     * Xi Jinping and Joe Biden are expected to discuss Ukraine, the
       Middle East, North Korea’s ties with Russia, Taiwan, human rights,
       artificial intelligence, in a meeting scheduled for Wednesday at
       the Apec summit.
     * At least three Russian officers were killed in the
       Moscow-controlled Ukrainian city of Melitopol in a blast Ukraine’s
       intelligence said was an “act of revenge” by local resistance
       groups.
     * US secretary of state Antony Blinken and newly appointed British
       foreign secretary David Cameron discussed the Israel-Hamas
       conflict, relations with China and help for Ukraine during a
       telephone call on Monday, the state department said. “Secretary
       Blinken and Lord Cameron underscored continuity in the US-UK
       special relationship and its importance to regional and global
       security,” state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a
       readout of the conversation.
     * Blinken promised a top Ukrainian official that sustained US support
       including help to get through the winter, with Russia expected to
       strike Kyiv’s infrastructure again. Blinken met Andriy Yermak, a
       top aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on a brief stop in
       Washington in between the top US diplomat’s latest Middle East
       crisis tour and an Asia-Pacific summit in San Francisco.
     * Save Ukraine, an organisation that focuses on rescuing Ukraine’s
       most vulnerable people, has said its rescuers have evacuated more
       than 108,880 people from the frontlines since Russia launched its
       full-scale invasion in February 2022. It said its rescue network
       provided humanitarian assistance to more than 186,450 people, with
       its hotline operators fielding more than 161,425 calls from
       Ukrainians in urgent need of assistance.
