Amidst the war, Ukraine’s First Mental Health Forum Hosts Hundreds in Kyiv

   23 October 2023

   KYIV, UKRAINE, 20 October 2023 – A first of its kind hybrid forum
   titled "Moving Towards Mental Health System & Services of the Future: A
   Case of Building Back and Forward Better in Ukraine" wrapped up its
   three-day run in Kyiv today.

   Organized by World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coordination
   Center for Mental Health of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, the
   forum brought together over 400 participants, with over two thousand
   more joining online. These included representatives of government
   agencies and non-governmental sector, local and international
   organizations, mental health experts from Ukraine and a number of
   countries - France, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, the United
   Kingdom, Belgium, Slovakia, Canada, as well as from WHO headquarters
   and the WHO Regional Office for Europe.

   "Our task and the task of such forums is to establish horizontal
   cooperation. We need to understand who refers to whom and where if
   necessary. Who should “pick up” and provide the exact assistance a
   person needs,” said Ukraine’s Minister of Health Dr. Viktor Liashko
   during the welcoming panel.

   The event served as a platform for showcasing global best practices,
   fostering the exchange of experiences, and crafting innovative
   solutions through cross-sectoral dialogue to address the pressing issue
   of mental health amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine.

   "Cooperation is important not only at the national but also at the
   international level,” said Vice Prime Minister and the Minister for
   Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine Iryna
   Vereshchuk. “Exchange of experience, coordination of efforts - all this
   is to ensure that all humanitarian resources sent to Ukraine go to
   where they are most needed.”

   The Forum hosted presentations, panel discussions, workshops,
   interactive zones, and a marketplace where participating organizations
   presented their achievements and developments in the area of mental
   health. Discussions spinned the entire spectrum of mental health care -
   from awareness raising and fostering a culture of self-help to human
   rights and engagement of people with lived experience of mental health
   conditions.

   "I am confident that the Forum will contribute to innovative solutions
   helping ensure that every Ukrainian has access to quality mental health
   services. We are continuing to make tremendous progress in spite of the
   ongoing war, and I am grateful to all the partners for coming together
   to make this work possible," added Dr. Jarno Habicht, WHO
   Representative in Ukraine.

   The Forum is held within the framework of the All-Ukrainian Mental
   Health Program, created and implemented at the initiative of First Lady
   of Ukraine Olena Zelenska.

   “Addressing the immense trauma and mental health impact of this war
   cannot wait. It is important to bring humanitarian supplies, but they
   need to be better connected to health care services and mental health
   support”, Denise Brown, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in
   Ukraine.
