   Gaza Strip

   Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says an Israeli air strike killed at
   least 70 people in the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in the centre of the strip.

   A spokesman said the death toll was likely to rise given the large number
   of families living in the area.

   The Israeli military told the BBC it was looking into reports of the
   strike.

   It comes as Israeli and Arab media say Egypt, which borders the Gaza
   Strip, has put forward a new proposal for a ceasefire between Israel and
   Hamas.

   Dozens of injured people were rushed from Maghazi to nearby Al-Aqsa
   Hospital with footage showing some children's faces covered in blood and
   body bags piled outside.

   The health ministry says three houses were hit in the attack late on
   Sunday.

   According to ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra, a densely populated
   residential block was destroyed.

   A father said he had lost his daughter and grandchildren, adding that his
   family had fled from the north for safety in central Gaza.

   "They lived on the third floor of one of the buildings," he said. "The
   wall collapsed on them. My grandchildren, my daughter, her husband - all
   gone.

   "We are all targeted. Civilians are targeted. There is no safe place. They
   told us to leave Gaza City - now we came to central Gaza to die."

   The Palestine Red Crescent Society says "intense" Israeli air strikes have
   led to the closure of main roads between Maghazi and two other refugee
   camps, Al-Bureij and Al-Nuseirat, "hindering the work of ambulances and
   rescue teams".

   In a statement to the BBC, the Israeli military said it had received
   "reports of an incident in the Maghazi camp".

   "Despite the challenges posed by Hamas terrorists operating within
   civilian areas in Gaza, the IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] is committed to
   international law including taking feasible steps to minimize harm to
   civilians," it added.

   According to the health ministry, more than 20,000 people have been killed
   - mostly children and women - and 54,000 injured in Gaza since 7 October,
   when Hamas and other Palestinian groups attacked Israel, killing 1,200
   people and taking about 240 hostages.

     * Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza?

   Earlier on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war
   had come at a "very heavy price" for his country.

   The Israeli military said more than a dozen soldiers had been killed in
   Gaza since Friday, bringing the total for the ground offensive launched
   after 7 October to 156.

   Saturday was one of its deadliest days but Mr Netanyahu said there was "no
   choice" but to keep fighting.

   The new ceasefire proposal by Egypt would be implemented in three parts:

     * The first phase of the ceasefire would see a humanitarian pause of
       seven to ten days during which Hamas would release all civilian
       hostages in exchange for some Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails
     * In the week-long second phase, Hamas would release all Israeli female
       soldiers in return for more prisoners and the exchange of corpses held
       since 7 October
     * The third phase, which would last a month, would see the release of
       the remaining hostages and a number of Palestinian prisoners and
       Israel withdrawing from the Gaza Strip and suspension of all aerial
       activities.

   Indirect negotiations would be held in Egypt with Qatari and US
   participation.

   An Israeli source told Maariv newspaper that the Egyptian initiative could
   lead to negotiations. Hamas says it is studying the proposal.

   Meanwhile, the Danish shipping giant, Maersk, says it is preparing to
   resume shipping operations through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.

   The announcement came after an international military operation, led by
   the US, was deployed to prevent the targeting of commercial ships by
   drones from areas of Yemen controlled by Houthi rebels. The Houthis have
   declared their support for Hamas and have said they would target any ship
   travelling to Israel.

   Maersk and other shipping companies stopped sending ships through the Red
   Sea and the Suez Canal earlier this month as a result of drone attacks. US
   Central Command said two days ago that a US navy destroyer had shot down
   four drones in the Red Sea launched from Yemeni territory.

   In another development, Pope Francis appealed for peace in the Middle East
   as he presided over a Christmas Eve Mass at Saint Peter's Basilica in the
   Vatican.

   Referring to the war between Israel and Hamas, the Pope said Jesus's
   message of peace was being drowned out by the "futile logic of war" in the
   very land where he had been born.
