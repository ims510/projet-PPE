   WASHINGTON (AP) — The negotiations hardly ran smoothly. But in the end,
   persistence paid off.

   Six weeks ago, not long after Hamas killed more than 1,200 people in
   Israel and took scores of others hostage in a surprise assault, the
   government of Qatar quietly reached out to the United States to discuss
   how to secure the release of those who were taken captive by the militant
   group.

   But the mission demanded extreme sensitivity. It was so secret that U.S.
   officials established a communications cell to reach Hamas directly and
   kept those negotiations tightly guarded throughout the U.S. government.
   Only a handful of people were aware of the talks, according to a senior
   White House official.

   The cell allowed the small circle of negotiators to speak regularly
   without additional bureaucracy. U.S. and Israeli officials spent weeks
   scrambling to put together a deal that would free dozens of hostages held
   by Hamas. The White House saw that as the only realistic way to halt the
   bloody combat that has devastated the region for more than six weeks.

   What does the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas look like?

   The U.S. continuously pushed Hamas, with Qatar and Egypt acting as
   critical intermediaries. All the while, President Joe Biden and other
   senior U.S. officials assured distraught family members of hostages
   through emotional Zooms and in-person meetings that they were doing
   everything they could to secure their loved ones’ release.

   The U.S. president was still working on the hostage deal as late as
   Wednesday in phone calls with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
   and other world leaders, stressing the importance of moving from agreement
   to actual releases. Biden vowed that he would not relent until all
   American hostages in Gaza were released.

   And there was a final hiccup in the agreement both sides apparently had
   reached. Talks continued, and no hostages were to be released before
   Friday.

   Biden said the White House had been working tirelessly to secure the
   release of hostages since the “earliest moments of Hamas’s brutal
   assault.”

   This account of how the hostage deal came together was described by the
   senior White House official and two Egyptian officials who were granted
   anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations, as well as accounts in
   Israeli media.

   The cell to communicate with Hamas was established by Brett McGurk, the
   National Security Council’s coordinator for the Middle East, and Joshua
   Geltzer, legal adviser to the National Security Council. McGurk would
   speak every morning with Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, the
   Qatari prime minister, while Jake Sullivan, the White House national
   security adviser, communicated daily with his Israeli counterparts, with
   Biden being briefed throughout. Also critical was CIA Director Bill Burns,
   who had been talking with David Barnea, the director of Mossad, the
   Israeli intelligence agency.

   The final deal that emerged this week — during a four-day cease-fire,
   Hamas would release 50 hostages in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners
   held by Israel — was an agreement that evolved through the weeks of
   negotiations.

   One of the earliest proposals was put forward on Oct. 12, five days after
   the initial Hamas attack, and it called for releasing all women and
   children held by Hamas and other Palestinian militants in Gaza, in return
   for freeing all Palestinian women in Israeli prisons, according to the
   Egyptian officials.

   The Israelis rejected that initial proposal, but it “opened the door for
   more talks,” one of the Egyptian officials said.

   In repeated conversations in late October between Biden and Netanyahu, the
   Israeli prime minister underscored his red line: The attacks on Gaza would
   cease only if there was a hostage release. Biden had his own demand
   throughout the talks: Humanitarian assistance had to reach Gaza,
   regardless of a deal.

   Eventually, the first two U.S. hostages held by Hamas – Natalie and Judith
   Raanan – were released. As senior national security officials tracked
   their release out of Gaza and Biden personally phoned Natalie’s father to
   tell him of the news, the White House became more confident that the
   secret cell set up to talk with Hamas would work, and intensified efforts
   to rescue more hostages.

   Shortly after the Raanans’ release — and just before a long-anticipated
   Israeli ground invasion into Gaza — the U.S. was informed that Hamas had
   signed off on the contours of a deal that would halt the offensive
   temporarily while the women and children were released.

   But there were multiple issues, from Israel’s view: Hamas had offered no
   proof of life of any of the hostages, nor would it say who precisely was
   being held until the fighting ceased. That, for Israel, wouldn’t be enough
   to stop the ground invasion. The U.S., too, was skeptical.

   Meanwhile, Hamas’ political leaders in Beirut, Doha and Cairo accused
   Israel of stalling the talks.

   Hamas political bureau member Basem Naim told journalists in Beirut on
   Nov. 10 that the group was prepared to release the civilian hostages if
   there were guarantees of “safe movement so that we can collect information
   and data to implement this step.” He complained that Israel was not
   responsive.

   Still, the negotiations continued.

   Israel’s ground invasion plans were revised so fighting could be paused if
   a hostage deal came together. The talks — with messages being routed
   through Doha or Cairo into Gaza — veered into highly technical details,
   and proposals flew back and forth. The U.S. repeatedly pushed Hamas, with
   Doha as the intermediary, to provide identifying information for the women
   and children being held. The militant group continued to refuse.

   By Nov. 12, Biden had had enough.

   He called Qatar’s ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and
   demanded specifics from Hamas. For any agreement to go through, Biden
   insisted, the U.S. needed clear identifications for the estimated 50
   hostages who would be freed — ages, gender, where they were from.
   Otherwise, the deal would not go through.

   Shortly after that call, Hamas produced the information the U.S. had
   sought. Biden called Netanyahu on Nov. 14 and urged the prime minister to
   take the deal. Netanyahu agreed to move forward. In meetings with McGurk,
   Netanyahu urged the U.S. to press the Qataris to nail down the final
   terms.

   During this time, the mediators had been swapping more workable drafts of
   a hostage agreement. One version outlined a five-day cease-fire and the
   release of somewhere between 200 to 300 Palestinian women and children.
   Israel had insisted on a two-day cease-fire and the release of about 100
   non-Hamas Palestinians.

   But Hamas then went dark. The militant group stopped talking with the
   Qataris and Egyptians, threatening to walk from the talks after the
   Israeli Defense Forces entered Shifa Hospital, the largest and
   best-equipped medical center in Gaza that Israel insists is being used by
   Hamas for military purposes.

   “Everything was to fall apart at this stage,” one of the Egyptian
   officials said. “Hamas was angry. We all were angry.”

   For three days, Egypt, Qatar and the U.S. pressured the warring sides to
   reach a compromise: Four-day cease-fire, and three Palestinian prisoners
   for each hostage. Egypt also insisted on easing Israeli restrictions on
   the flow of humanitarian aid. Talks resumed last Friday, and in another
   conversation with the Qatari emir, Biden told him it was the last shot at
   a hostage deal and he had to close it now.

   McGurk spent the next several days after that call between Biden and Al
   Thani hammering out the finer points of the hostage agreement. Officials
   also crafted a way to try to entice Hamas to release more hostages than
   the 50 already agreed to. The universe of unresolved issues continued to
   narrow until Tuesday morning, Nov. 21, when Hamas told Qatari officials
   they were on board.

   On Wednesday, Israel’s war cabinet signed off.

   “In recent days, I have spoken with our friend, US President Joe Biden and
   I requested his intervention in order to improve the outline that will be
   presented to you,” Netanyahu said as his war cabinet convened. “Indeed, it
   has been improved to include more hostages and at a lower cost. These
   talks have been productive. President Biden joined in the effort and I
   thank him for it.”
