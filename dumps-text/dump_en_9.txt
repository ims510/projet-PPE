   War film is a film genre concerned with warfare, typically about naval,
   air, or land battles, with combat scenes central to the drama.^[1]^[2]
   Themes explored include combat, survival and escape, camaraderie between
   soldiers, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the effects of
   war on society, and the moral and human issues raised by war. The stories
   told may be fiction, historical drama, or biographical.

   Subgenres, not necessarily distinct, include anti-war, comedy, propaganda,
   and documentary. There are similarly subgenres of the war film in specific
   theatres such as the Western Desert of North Africa and the Pacific in the
   Second World War, Vietnam, or the Soviet–Afghan War; and films set in
   specific domains of war, such as the infantry, the air, at sea, in
   submarines or at prisoner of war camps.

Genre[edit]

   The war film genre is not necessarily tightly defined: the American Film
   Institute, for example, speaks of "films to grapple with the Great War"
   without attempting to classify these.^[3] However, some directors and
   critics have offered at least tentative definitions. The director Sam
   Fuller defined the genre by saying that "a war film's objective, no matter
   how personal or emotional, is to make a viewer feel war."^[4] John Belton
   identified four narrative elements of the war film within the context of
   Hollywood production: a) the suspension of civilian morality during times
   of war, b) primacy of collective goals over individual motivations, c)
   rivalry between men in predominantly male groups as well as
   marginalization and objectification of women, and d) depiction of the
   reintegration of veterans.^[5] The fateful nature of battle scenes means
   that war films often end with them.^[6]

   The film critic Stephen Neale suggests that the genre is for the most part
   well defined and uncontentious, since war films are simply those about war
   being waged in the 20th century, with combat scenes central to the drama.
   However, Neale notes, films set in the American Civil War or the American
   Indian Wars of the 19th century were called war films in the time before
   the First World War.^[1] The critic Julian Smith argues, on the contrary,
   that the war film lacks the formal boundaries of a genre like the Western,
   but that in practice, "successful and influential" war films are about
   modern wars, in particular World War II, with the combination of mobile
   forces and mass killing.^[2] The film scholar Kathryn Kane^[7] points out
   some similarities between the war film genre and the Western. Both genres
   use opposing concepts like war and peace, civilization and savagery. War
   films usually frame World War II as a conflict between "good" and "evil"
   as represented by the Allied forces and Nazi Germany whereas the Western
   portrays the conflict between civilized settlers and the savage indigenous
   peoples.^[8] James Clarke notes the similarity between a Western like Sam
   Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch and "war-movie escapades" like The Dirty
   Dozen.^[9]

   The film historian Jeanine Basinger states that she began with a
   preconception of what the war film genre would be, namely that:

     What I knew in advance was what presumably every member of our culture
     would know about World War II combat films—that they contained a hero, a
     group of mixed types [of people], and a military objective of some sort.
     They take place in the actual combat zones of World War II, against the
     established enemies, on the ground, the sea, or in the air. They contain
     many repeated events, such as mail call, all presented visually with
     appropriate uniforms, equipment, and iconography of battle.^[10]

   Further, Basinger considers Bataan to provide a definition-by-example of
   "the World War II combat film", in which a diverse and apparently unsuited
   group of "hastily assembled volunteers" hold off a much larger group of
   the enemy through their "bravery and tenacity".^[11] She argues that the
   combat film is not a subgenre but the only genuine kind of war film. Since
   she notes that there were in fact only five true combat films made during
   the Second World War, in her view these few films, central to the genre,
   are outweighed by the many other films that are only just war films.^[12]
   However, other critics such as Russell Earl Shain propose a far broader
   definition of war film, to include films that deal "with the roles of
   civilians, espionage agents, and soldiers in any of the aspects of war
   (i.e. preparation, cause, prevention, conduct, daily life, and
   consequences or aftermath.)"^[13] Neale points out that genres overlap,
   with combat scenes for different purposes in other types of film, and
   suggests that war films are characterised by combat which "determines the
   fate of the principal characters". This in turn pushes combat scenes to
   the climactic ends of war films.^[6] Not all critics agree, either, that
   war films must be about 20th-century wars. James Clarke includes Edward
   Zwick's Oscar-winning Glory (1990) among the war films he discusses in
   detail; it is set in the American Civil War, and he lists six other films
   about that war which he considers "notable".^[14]^[a] The screenwriter and
   scholar Eric R. Williams identifies war films as one of eleven
   super-genres in his screenwriters' taxonomy, claiming that all
   feature-length narrative films can be classified as belonging to one of
   them.^[b]^[16]

   The British military historian Antony Beevor "despair[s]" at how
   film-makers from America and Britain "play fast and loose with the facts",
   yet imply that "their version is as good as the truth".^[17] For example,
   he calls the 2000 American film U-571 a "shameless deception" for
   pretending that a US warship had helped to win the Battle of the
   Atlantic—seven months before America entered the war.^[17] He is equally
   critical of Christopher Nolan's 2017 film Dunkirk with its unhistorically
   empty beaches, low-level air combat over the sea, and rescues mainly by
   the "little ships".^[17] Beevor feels, however, that Continental European
   film-makers are often "far more scrupulous"; for example, in his view the
   2004 German film Downfall accurately depicted the historical events of
   Hitler's final days in his Berlin bunker,^[17] and he considers the 1965
   French film The 317th Platoon, set in Vietnam, "the greatest war movie
   ever made". The 1966 film The Battle of Algiers is, he argues, a close
   second.^[17]

History[edit]

  American Civil War[edit]

   The costliest war in U.S. history in terms of American life, this war has
   been the subject of, or the backdrop to, numerous films, documentaries and
   mini-series. One of the earliest films using the Civil War as its subject
   was D.W. Griffith's 1910 silent picture, The Fugitive.^[18] Films that
   have the war as its main subject, or about a certain aspect of the war,
   include the 1989 film Glory, about the first formal unit of the Union Army
   during the American Civil War to be made up entirely of Black
   volunteers.^[19] Some films such as Gettysburg focused on a single battle
   during the war,^[20] or even on a single incident, like the French short
   film La Rivière du Hibou (An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge)^[21] and
   Disney's The Great Locomotive Chase (1956).^[22] Others like the 1993
   miniseries North and South spanned the entire breadth of the war. Some
   films deal with the human aspects of the war, such as The Red Badge of

  The Spanish–American War[edit]

   The first war films come from the Spanish–American War of 1898. Short
   "actualities"—documentary film-clips—included Burial of the Maine Victims,
   Blanket-Tossing of a New Recruit, and Soldiers Washing Dishes. These
   non-combat films were accompanied by "reenactments" of fighting, such as
   of Theodore Roosevelt's "Rough Riders" in action against the Spanish,
   staged in the United States.^[26]

  First World War[edit]

   Kingdom during the First World War § Media, United States home front
   during World War I § Motion pictures, and Home front during World War I

   During the First World War, many films were made about life in the war.
   Topics included prisoners of war, covert operations, and military
   training. Both the Central Powers and the Allies produced war
   documentaries. The films were also used as propaganda in neutral countries
   like the United States. Among these was a film shot on the Eastern Front
   by official war photographer to the Central Powers, Albert K. Dawson: The
   Battle and Fall of Przemysl (1915), depicting the Siege of Przemyśl,
   disastrous for the Austrians, with incidents reenacted using soldiers as
   extras.^[27]^[28]

   The 1915 Australian film Within Our Gates (also known as Deeds that Won
   Gallipoli) by Frank Harvey was described by the Motion Picture News as "a
   really good war story, which is exceptional".^[29]

   [IMG]Staged scene of British troops advancing through barbed wire from The
   Battle of the Somme, 1916

   The 1916 British film The Battle of the Somme, by two official
   cinematographers, Geoffrey Malins and John McDowell, combined documentary
   and propaganda, seeking to give the public an impression of what trench
   warfare was like. Much of the film was shot on location at the Western
   Front in France; it had a powerful emotional impact. It was watched by
   some 20 million people in Britain in its six weeks of exhibition, making
   it what the critic Francine Stock called "one of the most successful films
   of all time".^[30]^[31]

   The 1925 American film The Big Parade depicted unglamorous elements of
   war: the protagonist loses his leg, and his friends are killed.^[32]
   William A. Wellman's Wings (1927) showed aerial combat during the war and
   was made in cooperation with the Army Air Corps. It proved a powerful
   recruiting tool.^[33] It became the first film (in any genre) to be
   awarded an Oscar for best picture.^[34] Later films of varied genres that
   deal with the First World War include David Lean's "colossal epic", both
   war film and biopic^[35] Lawrence of Arabia (1962), shot in the then
   unfamiliar and exciting 70mm Technicolor,^[36] and described by Steven
   Spielberg as "maybe the greatest screenplay ever written for the
   motion-picture medium";^[35] Richard Attenborough's satirical anti-war
   musical comedy based on Joan Littlewood's play of the same name, Oh! What
   a Lovely War (1969);^[37] Spielberg's 2011 war drama War Horse was based
   on Michael Morpurgo's children's novel of the same name.^[38]

   Many of the films promoted as "documentaries" added context to authentic
   battlefield scenes by staging critical events, and invented episodes and
   dialog to enhance excitement at the cost of authenticity.^[39]

  Finnish Civil War[edit]

   Although the 1918 Finnish Civil War between Whites and Reds remained a
   controversial topic a century later in Finland,^[40]^[41] many Finnish
   filmmakers have taken up the subject, often basing their work on a book.
   In 1957, Toivo Särkkä's 1918, based on Jarl Hemmer's play and novel, was
   screened at the 7th Berlin International Film Festival.^[42] Recent films
   include Lauri Törhönen's 2007 The Border,^[43]^[44] and Aku Louhimies's
   2008 Tears of April, based on Leena Lander's novel.^[45] Perhaps the most
   famous film about the Finnish Civil War is Edvin Laine's 1968 Here,
   Beneath the North Star, based on the first two books of Väinö Linna's
   Under the North Star trilogy; it describing the civil war from the losing
   side, Finland's Red Guards.^[46]

  Spanish Civil War[edit]

   Further information: List of Spanish Civil War films
   [IMG]Soviet poster for an exhibition about the Spanish Civil War, 1936

   The Spanish Civil War has attracted directors from different countries.
   Sam Wood's For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), based on Ernest Hemingway's
   book of the same name, portrays the fated romance between an American
   played by Gary Cooper and a partisan played by Ingrid Bergman against the
   backdrop of the civil war. The epic 168-minute film with its landscapes
   shot in Technicolor and a "beautiful" orchestral score was a success both
   with audiences and with critics.^[47] Alain Resnais's Guernica (1950) uses
   Picasso's 1937 painting of the same name to protest against war.^[47]
   Carlos Saura's La Caza (The Hunt, 1966) uses the metaphor of hunting to
   criticise the aggressiveness of Spanish fascism.^[48] It won the Silver
   Bear for Best Director at the 16th Berlin International Film Festival in
   1966.^[49] Ken Loach's Land and Freedom (Tierra y Libertad, 1995), loosely
   based on George Orwell's Homage to Catalonia, follows a British communist
   through the war to reveal the painful contradictions within the
   anti-fascist Republican side.^[47]

  Korean War[edit]

   See also: Category:Korean War films

   Samuel Fuller's The Steel Helmet (1951) was made during the Korean War
   (1950–1953). The critic Guy Westwell notes that it questioned the conduct
   of the war, as did later films like The Bridges at Toko-Ri (1954) and Pork
   Chop Hill (1959).^[50] Fuller agreed that all his films were anti-war. No
   Hollywood films about the Korean War did well at the box office; the
   historian Lary May suggested in 2001 that they reminded American viewers
   of "the only war we have lost".^[51]

   In 1955, after the fighting, the successful South Korean action film
   Piagol about leftist guerrilla atrocities encouraged other film-makers.
   The 1960s military government punished pro-communist film-makers and gave
   Grand Bell Awards to films with the strongest anti-communist message. The
   Taebaek Mountains (1994) dealt with leftists from the south who fought for
   the communists, while Silver Stallion (1991) and Spring in My Hometown
   (1998) showed the destructive impact of American military presence on
   village life. The violent action films Shiri (1999) and Joint Security
   Area (2000) presented North Korea in a favourable light.^[52]

   Films in North Korea were made by government film studios and had clear
   political messages. The first was My Home Village (1949), on the
   liberation of Korea from the Japanese, presented as the work of Kim Il
   Sung without help from the Americans. Similarly, the country's films about
   the Korean War show victory without help from the Chinese. The film
   scholar Johannes Schönherr concludes that the purpose of these films is
   "to portray North Korea as a country under siege", and that since the U.S.
   and its "puppet" South Korea invaded the North once, they would do so
   again.^[53]

  Algerian War[edit]

   Gillo Pontecorvo's dramatic The Battle of Algiers ((Italian: La battaglia
   di Algeri; Arabic: معركة الجزائر; French: La Bataille d'Alger), 1966)
   portrayed events in the Algerian War (1954–1956). It was shot on location
   as an Italo-Algerian co-production. It had the black and white newsreel
   style of Italian neorealism, and even-handedly depicts violence on both
   sides. It won various awards including Golden Lion at the Venice Film
   Festival.^[54] It was attacked by French critics and was for five years
   banned in France as well as Jamila, the Algerian (1958).^[55]

  Vietnam War[edit]

   Further information: Vietnam War in film

   Few films before the late 1970s about the Vietnam War actually depicted
   combat;^[56] exceptions include The Green Berets (1968).^[56] Critics such
   as Basinger explain that Hollywood avoided the subject because of
   opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, making the
   subject divisive; in addition, the film industry was in crisis, and the
   army did not wish to assist in making anti-war films.^[56]^[57]

   From the late 1970s, independently financed and produced films showed
   Hollywood that Vietnam could be treated in film. Successful but very
   different portrayals of the war in which America had been defeated
   included Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter (1978), and Francis Ford
   Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979).^[56] With the shift in American politics
   to the right in the 1980s, military success could again be shown in films
   such as Oliver Stone's Platoon (1986), Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket
   (1987) and John Irvin's Hamburger Hill (1987).^[56]

   The Vietnamese director Nguyễn Hồng Sến [vi]'s The Abandoned Field: Free
   Fire Zone (Cánh đồng hoang, 1979) gives an "unnerving and compelling ..
   subjective-camera-eye-view" of life under helicopter fire in the Mekong
   Delta during the Vietnam War. The film cuts to an (American)
   "helicopter-eye view", contrasting painfully with the human tenderness
   seen earlier.^[58]

  Later wars[edit]

   Dino Mustafić's Remake (2003), written by Zlatko Topčić, tells the
   parallel coming-of-age stories of a father living in Sarajevo during World
   War II and his son living through the Siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian
   War. According to Topčić, the story is based on incidents from his own
   life.^[59]^[60]

   The Iraq War served as the background story of U.S. movies, like The Hurt
   Locker from 2008, Green Zone from 2010,^[61] and American Sniper from
   2014.

   The War in Afghanistan since 2001 was depicted in various movies, among
   them Restrepo in 2010 and Lone Survivor from 2013.^[61]

Second World War[edit]

  Made by Western Allies[edit]

   Further information: List of Allied propaganda films of World War II

   The first popular Allied war films made during the Second World War came
   from Britain and combined the functions of documentary and propaganda.
   Films such as The Lion Has Wings and Target for Tonight were made under
   the control of the Films Division of the Ministry of Information. The
   British film industry began to combine documentary techniques with
   fictional stories in films like Noël Coward and David Lean's In Which We
   Serve (1942)—"the most successful British film of the war
   years"^[62]—Millions Like Us (1943), and The Way Ahead (1944).^[63]

   [IMG]B-25s about to launch from the USS Hornet in Thirty Seconds Over
   Tokyo (1944)

   In America, documentaries were produced in various ways: General Marshall
   commissioned the Why We Fight propaganda series from Frank Capra; the War
   Department's Information-Education Division started out making training
   films for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy; the Army made its own through
   the U.S. Signal Corps, including John Huston's The Battle of San
   Pietro.^[64] Hollywood made films with propaganda messages about America's
   allies, such as Mrs. Miniver (1942), which portrayed a British family on
   the home front;^[65] Edge of Darkness (1943) showed Norwegian resistance
   fighters,^[66] and The North Star (1943) showed the Soviet Union and its
   Communist Party.^[67] Towards the end of the war popular books provided
   higher quality and more serious stories for films such as Guadalcanal
   Diary (1943),^[68] Mervyn LeRoy's Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944),^[69]
   and John Ford's They Were Expendable (1945).^[70]

   Moscow

   The Soviet Union, too, appreciated the propaganda value of film, to
   publicise both victories and German atrocities. Ilya Kopalin's documentary
   Moscow Strikes Back (Russian: Разгром немецких войск под Москвой,
   literally "The rout of the German troops near Moscow"), was made during
   the Battle of Moscow between October 1941 and January 1942. It depicted
   civilians helping to defend the city, the parade in Red Square and
   Stalin's speech rousing the Russian people to battle, actual fighting,
   Germans surrendering and dead, and atrocities including murdered children
   and hanged civilians. It won an Academy Award in 1943 for best
   documentary.^[71]^[72] Newsreel cameras were similarly rushed to
   Stalingrad early in 1943 to record "the spectacle which greeted the
   Russian soldiers"—the starvation of Russian prisoners of war in the
   Voropovono camp by the German Sixth Army, defeated in the Battle of
   Stalingrad.^[73]

   Feature films made in the west during the war were subject to censorship
   and were not always realistic in nature. One of the first to attempt to
   represent violence, and which was praised at the time for "gritty
   realism", was Tay Garnett's Bataan (1943). The depiction actually remained
   stylised. Jeanine Basinger gives as an example the "worst image for stark
   violence" when a Japanese soldier beheads an American: the victim shows
   pain and his lips freeze in a scream, yet no blood spurts and his head
   does not fall off. Basinger points out that while this is physically
   unrealistic, psychologically it may not have been. The wartime audience
   was, she points out, well aware of friends and relatives who had been
   killed or who had come home wounded.^[74]

  Made by Axis powers[edit]

   Further information: Nazi propaganda and Japanese propaganda during World
   War II
   [IMG]Hitler and Goebbels visiting Universum Film AG in 1935. The studio
   made propaganda films such as Triumph des Willens (1935) and Kolberg
   (1945).

   The Axis powers similarly made films during the Second World War, for
   propaganda and other purposes. In Germany, the army high command brought
   out Sieg im Westen ("Victory in the West", 1941).^[75] Other Nazi
   propaganda films had varied subjects, as with Kolberg (1945), which
   depicts stubborn Prussian resistance in the Siege of Kolberg (1807) to the
   invading French troops under Napoleon.^[76] The propaganda minister Joseph
   Goebbels chose the historical subject as suitable for the worsening
   situation facing Nazi Germany when it was filmed from October 1943 to
   August 1944. At over eight million marks, using thousands of soldiers as
   extras and 100 railway wagonloads of salt to simulate snow, it was the
   most costly German film made during the war. The actual siege ended with
   the surrender of the town; in the film, the French generals abandon the
   siege.^[77]

   For Japan, the war began with the undeclared war and invasion of China in
   1937, which the Japanese authorities called "The China Incident". The
   government dispatched a "pen brigade" to write and film the action in
   China with "humanist values". Tomotaka Tasaka's Mud and Soldiers (1939)
   for instance, shot on location in China, Kōzaburō Yoshimura's Legend of
   Tank Commander Nishizumi, and Sato Takeshi's Chocolate and Soldiers (1938)
   show the common Japanese soldier as an individual and as a family man, and
   even enemy Chinese soldiers are presented as individuals, sometimes
   fighting bravely.^[78] Once war with the United States was declared, the
   Japanese conflict became known as the Pacific War. Japanese film critics
   worried that even with Western film techniques, their film output failed
   to represent native Japanese values.^[79] The historian John Dower found
   that Japanese wartime films had been largely forgotten, as "losers do not
   get reruns", yet they were so subtle and skilful that Frank Capra thought
   Chocolate and Soldiers unbeatable. Heroes were typically low-ranking
   officers, not samurai, calmly devoted to his men and his country.^[80]
   These films did not personalise the enemy and therefore lacked hatred,
   though Great Britain could figure as the "cultural enemy". For Japanese
   film-makers, war was not a cause but more like a natural disaster, and
   "what mattered was not whom one fought but how well". Asian enemies,
   especially the Chinese, were often portrayed as redeemable and even
   possible marriage partners. Japanese wartime films do not glorify war, but
   present the Japanese state as one great family and the Japanese people as
   an "innocent, suffering, self-sacrificing people". Dower comments that the
   perversity of this image "is obvious: it is devoid of any recognition
   that, at every level, the Japanese also victimized others."^[81]

  Postwar[edit]

   Netherlands, 1977

   According to Andrew Pulver of The Guardian, the public fascination with
   war films became an "obsession", with over 200 war films produced in each
   decade of the 1950s and 1960s.^[82] War film production in the United
   Kingdom and United States reached its zenith in the mid-1950s. ^[83] Its
   popularity in the United Kingdom was brought on by the critical and
   commercial success of Charles Frend's The Cruel Sea (1953).^[83] Like
   others of the period, The Cruel Sea was based on a bestselling novel, in
   this case the former naval commander Nicholas Monsarrat's story of the
   battle of the Atlantic.^[84]^[85] Others, like The Dam Busters (1954),
   with its exciting tale of the inventor Barnes Wallis's unorthodox bouncing
   bomb and its distinctive theme music, were true stories. The Dam Busters
   became the most popular film in Britain in 1955,^[86] and remained a
   favourite as of 2015 with a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes,^[87] though,
   partly because it celebrated an "exclusively British [victory]", it failed
   in the American market.^[88] A large number of war films were made in the
   1955–1958 period in particular. In 1957 alone, Bitter Victory, Count Five
   and Die, The Enemy Below, Ill Met by Moonlight, Men in War, The One That
   Got Away, and Seven Thunders, and the highly successful, critically
   acclaimed pictures The Bridge on the River Kwai (which won the Academy
   Award for Best Picture that year^[89]) and Paths of Glory were
   released.^[90] Some, such as Bitter Victory, focused more on the
   psychological battle between officers and egotism rather than events
   during the war.^[91] The Bridge on the River Kwai brought a new complexity
   to the war picture, with a sense of moral uncertainty surrounding war. By
   the end of the decade the "sense of shared achievement" which had been
   common in war films "began to evaporate", according to Pulver.^[82]

   Hollywood films in the 1950s and 1960s could display spectacular heroics
   or self-sacrifice, as in the popular Sands of Iwo Jima (1949) starring
   John Wayne. U.S. Marines considered Sands of Iwo Jima visually authentic,
   but found Lewis Milestone's Battle Cry (1955), with its attention to the
   lives of the men, the more realistic film.^[92] The formula for a
   successful war film consisted, according to Lawrence Suid, of a small
   group of ethnically diverse men; an unreasonable senior officer; cowards
   became heroic, or died.^[92] Jeanine Basinger suggests that a traditional
   war film should have a hero, a group, and an objective, and that the group
   should contain "an Italian, a Jew, a cynical complainer from Brooklyn, a
   sharpshooter from the mountains, a midwesterner (nicknamed by his state,
   'Iowa' or 'Dakota'), and a character who must be initiated in some
   way".^[74] Films based on real commando missions, like The Gift Horse
   (1952) based on the St. Nazaire Raid, and Ill Met by Moonlight (1956)
   based on the capture of the German commander of Crete, inspired fictional
   adventure films such as The Guns of Navarone (1961), The Train (1964), and
   Where Eagles Dare (1968). These used the war as a backdrop for spectacular
   action.^[82]

   Darryl F. Zanuck produced the 178 minute documentary drama The Longest Day
   (1962), based on the first day of the D-Day landings, achieving commercial
   success and Oscars.^[94] It was followed by large-scale but thoughtful
   films like Andrei Tarkovsky's Ivan's Childhood (1962), and
   quasi-documentary all-star epics filmed in Europe such as Battle of the
   Bulge (1965), Battle of Britain (1969), The Battle of Neretva (1969),
   Midway (1976), and A Bridge Too Far (1977). In Lawrence Suid's view, The
   Longest Day "served as the model for all subsequent combat
   spectaculars".^[95] However, its cost also made it the last of the
   traditional war films, while the controversy around the help given by the
   U.S. Army and Zanuck's "disregard for Pentagon relations" changed the way
   that Hollywood and the Army collaborated.^[95]

   Zanuck, by then an executive at 20th Century Fox, set up an
   American–Japanese co-production for Richard Fleischer's Tora! Tora! Tora!
   (1970) to depict what "really happened on December 7, 1941" in the
   surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.^[96]^[97] The film, panned by Roger
   Ebert^[98] and The New York Times,^[99] was a major success in Japan.^[96]
   Its realistic-looking attack footage was reused in later films such as
   Midway (1976), The Final Countdown (1980), and Australia (2008).^[100] The
   story was revisited in Pearl Harbor (2001), described by The New York
   Times as a "noisy, expensive and very long new blockbuster", with the
   comment that "for all its epic pretensions (as if epic were a matter of
   running time, tumescent music and earnest voice-over pronouncements), the
   movie works best as a bang-and-boom action picture".^[101]

   Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (1998) uses hand-held camera, sound
   design, staging, and increased audio-visual detail to defamiliarise
   viewers accustomed to conventional combat films, so as to create what film
   historian Stuart Bender calls "reported realism", whether or not the
   portrayal is genuinely more realistic.^[102] Jeanine Basinger notes that
   critics experienced it as "groundbreaking and anti-generic", with, in
   James Wolcott's words, a "desire to bury the cornball, recruiting poster
   legend of John Wayne: to get it right this time"; and that combat films
   have always been "grounded in the need to help an audience understand and
   accept war".^[74] Its success revived interest in World War II
   films.^[103] Others tried to portray the reality of the war, as in Joseph
   Vilsmaier's Stalingrad (1993), which The New York Times said "goes about
   as far as a movie can go in depicting modern warfare as a stomach-turning
   form of mass slaughter".^[104]

  Military–film industry relations[edit]

   Many war films have been produced with the cooperation of a nation's
   military forces. Since the Second World War, the United States Navy has
   provided ships and technical guidance for films such as Top Gun. The U.S.
   Air Force assisted with The Big Lift, Strategic Air Command and A
   Gathering of Eagles, which were filmed on Air Force bases; Air Force
   personnel appeared in many roles.^[105] Critics have argued that the film
   Pearl Harbor's US-biased portrayal of events is a compensation for
   technical assistance received from the US armed forces, noting that the
   premiere was held on board a U.S. Navy carrier.^[106] In another case, the
   U.S. Navy objected to elements of Crimson Tide, especially mutiny on board
   an American naval vessel, so the film was produced without their
   assistance.^[107] The film historian Jonathan Rayner observes that such
   films "have also clearly been intended to serve vital propagandist,
   recruitment and public relations functions".^[106]

National traditions[edit]

  Chinese[edit]

   The first Chinese war films were newsreels like Battle of Wuhan (1911) and
   Battle of Shanghai (1913). Still in films such as Xu Xinfu's Battle
   Exploits (1925), war featured mainly as background. Only with the Second
   Sino–Japanese War from 1937 onwards did war film become a serious genre in
   China, with nationalistic films such as Shi Dongshan's Protect Our Land
   (1938). The Chinese Civil War, too, attracted films such as Cheng Yin's
   From Victory to Victory (1952). A more humanistic film set in the same
   period is Xie Jin's The Cradle (1979), while more recent large-scale
   commercial films include Lu Chuan's City of Life and Death (2009).^[108]
   Chinese directors have repeatedly attempted to cover the atrocities
   committed by the Japanese during the Nanjing Massacre (1937–1938), with
   films such as the political melodrama Massacre in Nanjing, Mou Tun Fei's
   docudrama Black Sun: The Nanking Massacre, and the "contrived
   Sino–Japanese romance" Don't Cry, Nanking.^[109] Zhang Yimou's epic
   Chinese film Flowers of War (2011), based on Geling Yan's novel, portrays
   the violent events through the eyes of a 13-year-old girl.^[110]

  Indonesian[edit]

   [IMG]The Siliwangi Division in combat, in a scene from Usmar Ismail's
   Darah dan Doa, 1950

   Many Indonesian films deal with the occupation of the archipelago by the
   Japanese during the Second World War. Teguh Karya's Doea Tanda Mata
   (Mementos, literally "Two Eye Marks", 1985) covers the limited nationalist
   resistance to Dutch colonial rule in the 1930s.^[111]^[112] A third group
   of films such as Enam Djam di Jogja (Six Hours in Yogyakarta, 1951) and
   Serangan Fajar (Attack at Dawn, 1983) covers the Indonesian war of
   independence (1945–1949). Two other films about the same period portray
   the Indonesian equivalent of the Chinese Long March: Usmar Ismail's Darah
   dan Doa (The Long March, literally "Blood and Prayer", 1950) and Mereka
   Kembali (They Return, 1975). Each of these films interprets the past from
   the perspective of its own time.^[112]

   The more recent Merdeka (Freedom) trilogy (2009–2011), starting with Merah
   Putih ("Red and White", the colours of the flag of the new Indonesia),
   revisits the campaign for independence through the lives of a diverse
   group of cadets who become guerillas.^[113]

   Karya's November 1828 (1979) looks at Indonesia's struggle for
   independence through historical drama about the Java or Diponegoro War
   (1825–1830), though the colonial enemy was the same, the Dutch. Deanne
   Schultz considered it "a valuable interpretation" of Indonesian history
   that "embodies the best of popular Indonesian cinema". It was the first
   Indonesian film to become well known internationally.^[114]

  Soviet[edit]

   [IMG]Russia's "cinema front": Yury Ozerov (left) directing the filming of

   War has been the Soviet Union's cinema's major genre, becoming known
   indeed as the "cinema front", and its war films ranged from grim
   portrayals of atrocities to sentimental and even quietly subversive
   accounts.^[115] Leonid Lukov's popular and "beautiful"^[116] Two Warriors
   (1943) depicted two stereotypical Soviet soldiers, a quiet Russian and an
   extrovert southerner from Odessa, singing in his dugout.^[117]

   The many Soviet films about the Second World War include both large-scale
   epics such as Yury Ozerov's Battle of Moscow (1985) and Mikhail
   Kalatozov's more psychological The Cranes are Flying (1957) on the cruel
   effects of war; it won the 1958 Palme d'Or at Cannes.^[118]

  Japanese[edit]

   See also: § Animated, and Category:Japanese war films

   Japanese directors have made popular films such as Submarine I-57 Will Not
   Surrender (1959), Battle of Okinawa (1971) and Japan's Longest Day (1967)
   from a Japanese perspective.^[119] These "generally fail to explain the
   cause of the war".^[120] In the decades immediately after the Second World
   War, Japanese films often focused on human tragedy rather than combat,
   such as The Burmese Harp (1956) and Fires on the Plain (1959).^[120] From
   the late 1990s, films started to take a positive view of the war and of
   Japanese actions. These nationalistic films, including Pride (1998),
   Merdeka 17805 (2001), and The Truth about Nanjing (2007), have emphasized
   positive traits of the Japanese military and contended that the Japanese
   were victims of post-war vindictiveness and viciousness. Such films have,
   however, been subject to protest for revisionism.^[120]^[121]^[122] The
   Eternal Zero (2013) narrates the tale of a Zero fighter pilot who is
   considered a coward by his comrades, as he returns alive from his
   missions. It broke the record takings for a Japanese live action
   film,^[123] and won the Golden Mulberry at the Udine Far East Film
   Festival,^[124] but was criticised for its nationalistic sympathy with
   kamikaze pilots.^[125]

Subgenres[edit]

  Documentary[edit]

   documentary films

   The wartime authorities in both Britain and America produced a wide
   variety of documentary films. Their purposes included military training,
   advice to civilians, and encouragement to maintain security. Since these
   films often carried messages, they grade into propaganda. Similarly,
   commercially produced films often combined information, support for the
   war effort, and a degree of propaganda.^[63]^[64] Newsreels, ostensibly
   simply for information, were made in both Allied and Axis countries, and
   were often dramatised.^[126]^[127]^[128] More recently, in the Iran–Iraq
   War, Morteza Avini's Ravayat-e Fath (Chronicles of Victory) television
   series combined front-line footage with commentary.^[129]

  Propaganda[edit]

   Sergei Eisenstein's 1938 historical drama Alexander Nevsky depicts Prince
   Alexander's defeat of the attempted invasion of the Russian city of
   Novgorod by the Teutonic Knights.^[130] By April 1939 the film had been
   seen by 23,000,000 people.^[131] In 1941 the director and three others
   were awarded the Stalin Prize for their contributions. The film features a
   musical score by the classical composer Sergei Prokofiev, considered by
   artists such as the composer André Previn the best ever written for
   cinema.^[132]^[133] Russell Merritt, writing in Film Quarterly, describes
   it as a "war propaganda film".^[134] A 1978 Mondadori poll placed
   Alexander Nevsky among the world's 100 best motion pictures.^[135]

   [IMG]Screenshot from Frank Capra's wartime Why We Fight series,^[136]
   depicting lies being broadcast by the Nazi propaganda machine

   During the Second World War, film propaganda was widely used. Kenneth
   Clark advised the British government that "If we renounced interest in
   entertainment as such, we might be deprived of a valuable weapon for
   getting across our propaganda"; he suggested using documentaries about the
   war and the war effort; celebrations of Britishness; and films about
   British life and character. Michael Powell and Clark agreed on a story
   about survivors of a U-boat crew, imbued with brutal Nazi ideology,
   travelling across Canada and meeting various kind, tolerant and
   intelligent Canadians, to encourage America into the war. The resulting
   film, 49th Parallel (1941), became the top film at British offices that
   year.^[137] Entertaining films could carry messages about the need for
   vigilance, too, as in Went the Day Well? (1942) or the avoidance of
   "careless talk", as in The Next of Kin (1942).^[63]

   [IMG]The romantic drama Casablanca (1943) vilified Nazism.

   In America, Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator (1940) clearly satirised
   fascism.^[138] Michael Curtiz's Casablanca (1943) was not simply a romance
   between the characters played by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, but
   vilified the Nazis and glorified resistance to them.^[138] Frank Capra's
   Why We Fight series (1942–1945) won the 1942 Academy Award for best
   documentary, though it was designed to "influence opinion in the U.S.
   military".^[64]^[139]

   During the Cold War, "propaganda played as much of a role in the United
   States' struggle with the Soviet Union as did the billions of dollars
   spent on weaponry."^[140] Face to Face with Communism (1951) dramatised an
   imagined invasion of the United States; other films portrayed threats such
   as communist indoctrination.^[140]

  Submarine[edit]

   Main article: Submarine films
   [IMG]The cramped, equipment-filled setting of a submarine film, Das Boot
   (1981), recreated in the Bavaria film studio

   Submarine films have their own particular meanings and conventions,
   concerned specifically with giving the effect of submarine warfare. A
   distinctive element in this subgenre is the soundtrack, which attempts to
   bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea.
   For example, in Wolfgang Petersen's 1981 Das Boot, the sound design works
   together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with
   depth charges, the ping of sonar, and threatening sounds such as of the
   propellers of enemy destroyers and torpedoes.^[141] Classic films in the
   genre include The Enemy Below (1957)^[142] and Run Silent, Run Deep
   (1958), both based on novels by naval commanders. Run Silent, Run Deep is
   a movie full of tension, both with the enemy and between the contrasting
   personalities of the submarine Commander and his Lieutenant, played by
   Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster.^[143]

  Prisoner of war[edit]

   Further information: Prisoner of war § In popular culture
   [IMG]Model of Stalag Luft III used in filming The Great Escape (1963)

   A popular subgenre of war films in the 1950s and 1960s was the prisoner of
   war film.^[144] The genre was popularised in Britain with major films like
   Guy Hamilton's The Colditz Story (1955) and John Sturges's American film
   The Great Escape (1963).^[144] They told stories of real escapes from
   German prisoner of war camps such as Stalag Luft III in the Second World
   War. Despite episodes of danger and human tragedy, these films delight in
   a continual boyish game of escape and ingenuity, celebrating the courage
   and the defiant spirit of the prisoners of war, and treating war as
   fun.^[144]^[145]^[146] David Lean's Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) was
   judged best picture at the Oscars; it took the genre from chilly German
   prisons to the heat of a camp in Thailand. It was the first, too, to use
   lush colour to bring out the British stiff upper lip of the colonel,
   played by Alec Guinness in an Oscar-winning performance.^[144] The
   "definitive" Oscar-winning prisoner of war film was Billy Wilder's Stalag
   17 (1953), while the brief but powerful prison camp scenes of The Deer
   Hunter (1978) lend an air of tragedy to the whole of that film.^[144]

  Comedy[edit]

   Further information: Comedy film § Military comedy

   Charlie Chaplin's Shoulder Arms (1918) set a style for war films to come,
   and was the first comedy about war in film history.^[147]^[148]

   British cinema in the Second World War marked the evacuation of children
   from London with social comedies such as Those Kids from Town (1942) where
   the evacuees go to stay with an earl, while in Cottage to Let (1941) and
   Went the Day Well? (1942) the English countryside is thick with
   spies.^[149] Gasbags (1941) offered "zany, irreverent, knockabout" comedy
   making fun of everything from barrage balloons to concentration
   camps.^[150] Abbott and Costello's Buck Privates (1941) was successful in
   America,^[151] leading to many further wartime comedies.^[152]

  Animated[edit]

   [IMG]First animated propaganda film: Winsor McCay's The Sinking of the
   Lusitania (1918)

   Winsor McCay's The Sinking of the Lusitania (1918) was a silent First
   World War film. At 12 minutes long, it was the longest animated film made
   at that time. It was probably the first animated propaganda film to be
   made; it remains the earliest serious animated drama that has
   survived.^[153]^[154]^[155] Through World War II, animated propaganda
   shorts remained influential in American cinema. The Walt Disney Company,
   working with the American armed forces, produced 400,000 feet of war
   propaganda films between 1942 and 1945,^[156] including Der Fuehrer's Face
   (1943) and Education for Death (1943).^[157]

   Japanese anime films from the 1960s onwards addressed national memories of
   war. Akira (1988) moves from the atomic destruction of Hiroshima and
   Nagasaki to apocalyptic visions of global conflict; Grave of the Fireflies
   (1988) is elegiac on the effect of war on children.^[158]^[159] Barefoot
   Gen (1983) portrays the bombing of Hiroshima through the eyes of a
   child,^[160] but reviewers consider it a less well made film than Grave of
   the Fireflies with "stomach-churning detail" bizarrely paired with crude
   artwork, giving it the look of a "Saturday morning Warner Brothers
   cartoon".^[161]

  Anti-war[edit]

   Further information: List of anti-war films
   [IMG]Anti-war: Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front, 1930

   The anti-war genre began with films about the First World War. Films in
   the genre are typically revisionist, reflecting on past events and often
   generically blended. Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front
   (1930) was unquestionably powerful, and an early anti-war film, portraying
   a German point of view; it was the first film (in any genre) to win two
   Oscars, best picture and best director.^[148] Andrew Kelly, analysing All
   Quiet on the Western Front, defined the genre as showing: the brutality of
   war; the amount of human suffering; the betrayal of men's trust by
   incompetent officers. War and anti-war films often prove difficult to
   categorize as they contain many generic ambiguities.^[1] While many
   anti-war films criticize war directly through depictions of grisly combat
   in past wars, some films such as Penn's Alice's Restaurant criticized war
   obliquely by poking fun at such things as the draft board.^[162] The
   number of anti-war films produced in America dipped sharply during the
   1950s because of McCarthyism and the Hollywood blacklist.^[163] The end of
   the blacklist and the introduction of the MPAA rating system marked a time
   of resurgence for films of all type including anti-war films in the
   States. Robert Eberwein names two films as anti-war classics.^[164] The
   first is Jean Renoir's prisoner of war masterpiece^[148] La Grande
   Illusion (The Grand Illusion, 1937). Renoir's critique of contemporary
   politics and ideology celebrates the universal humanity that transcends
   national and racial boundaries and radical nationalism, suggesting that
   mankind's common experiences should prevail above political division, and
   its extension: war.^[165] The second is Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory
   (1957). The critic David Ehrenstein writes that Paths of Glory established
   Kubrick as the "leading commercial filmmaker of his generation" and a
   world-class talent. Ehrenstein describes the film as an "outwardly
   cool/inwardly passionate protest drama about a disastrous French army
   maneuver and the court-martial held in its wake", contrasting it with the
   "classic" All Quiet on the Western Front's story of an innocent "unstrung
   by the horrors of war".^[166]

  Mixed genres[edit]

   Comedy gave scope for satire, and post-war film-makers merged comedy and
   anti-war sentiment in films as varied as Stalag 17 (1953) and Dr
   Strangelove (1964).^[167] Black comedies like Mike Nichols's Catch-22
   (1970), based on Joseph Heller's satirical novel about the Second World
   War, and Robert Altman's MASH (1970), set in Korea, reflected the
   attitudes of an increasingly sceptical public during the Vietnam
   War.^[168]

   Other genres were combined in Franklin J. Schaffner's Patton (1970), about
   real life General George S. Patton, where combat scenes were interleaved
   with commentary about how he waged war, showing good and bad sides to a
   command. It and MASH became the two most profitable war/anti-war films
   made up to that time,^[169] and Patton won seven Academy Awards.^[170]
