   KYIV, 22 August 2023 - Child casualties in Ukraine increased by more
   than 7% between May to August compared to the previous four months as
   air and drone attacks tripled, with no end to the danger faced by
   children after 18 months of war, Save the Children said today.

   Since May 2023, a total of 148 children have been killed or injured in
   Ukraine, bringing the number of child casualties since the escalation
   of war on 24 Feb last year to more than 1,700, according to UN data.
   This includes 545 deaths, with 24 children killed this summer.

   The month of June was the deadliest so far this year for children with
   11 children killed and 43 more injured. According to verified UN
   data,[1] there was an increase in all civilian casualties in Ukraine in
   between 1 May and 13 August with June recording the highest number of
   total civilian casualties in 2023 at 865.

   Conflict analytics reports showed that between Jan 1- April 30 there
   were 459 air and drone strikes. This rose to 1,432 between 1 May and 4
   August, with about 95% of these attacks in populated areas.

   In one such attack on the morning of 31 July, a missile hit an
   apartment block in Kryvyi Rih, Southern Dnipro, destroying five storeys
   of a high-rise building. A 10-year-old girl and her mother were killed
   in the incident, with more than 80 further reported casualties,
   including seven injured children.

   Lyudmyla’s* apartment was one of more than 250 homes damaged in the
   neighbourhood. All the windows of her family’s home were blown out by
   the explosion and the noise woke up her 18-year-old grandson.

   “He was shocked, and rushed outside straight from his bed once he heard
   the explosion. He could not even change his clothes. He later came back
   to grab documents and that is when another explosion occurred. He was
   terrified by such a loud noise,” said Lyudmyla*, 65.

   “My two other grandchildren – aged 11 and 13 – were staying with their
   mother at a relative’s house. They were just 300 metres away from the
   explosion. The windows and doors were also blown out at that apartment.
   Everyone was scared.”

   On 11 August, an 8-year-old boy was killed in Kolomyia, western
   Ukraine, after a missile struck the back garden of his family home. A
   family of four was killed by shelling in Kherson region two days later,
   including a 12-year-old boy and a baby girl just 23 days old. Just last
   week on 19 August, a six-year-old girl was among the seven people
   killed and 180 injured in an attack in the northern city of Chernihiv.

   Amjad Yamin, Save the Children’s Advocacy Director in Ukraine, said:

   “*Ukraine is 18 months into full-scale war, and there seems to be no
   reprieve from the perilous circumstances endured by children and
   families. We have witnessed numerous attacks on populated areas that
   took the lives of children and their parents, left hundreds of people
   injured or severely distressed, and damaged or destroyed homes,
   plunging thousands of families into uncertainty. *

   *“Since last February, more than 1,*700 children have been killed or
   injured due to unrelenting hostilities. The vast majority of those
   casualties are attributed to missiles and drones being fired at
   residential areas. This serves as a grim reminder that explosive
   weapons should not be used anywhere near populated areas, such as towns
   and villages.”

   Save the Children is calling on all sides to adhere to obligations
   under international humanitarian and human rights law, and ensure that
   civilians and civilian objects, especially those used by children such
   as homes, schools, and hospitals, are protected from attack.

   Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering
   humanitarian aid to children and their families affected by
   hostilities. It is also supporting refugee families across Europe and
   helping children to access education and other critical services.
