   Is this the beginning of the end of the war in Ukraine?

Is this the beginning of the end of the war in Ukraine?

   The Western media is suddenly teeming with signs of fatigue and even
   .... diplomacy?

   “I don’t think that [the war] is a stalemate,” Ukrainian president
   Volodymyr Zelensky told NBC News’ Meet the Press on Sunday.

   “They thought they would checkmate us, but,” he insisted, “this didn’t
   happen.” According to recent interviews, his military leadership
   disagrees. His political inner circle thinks his insistence is
   delusional.

   Zelensky is facing pressure both from within Ukraine and from without.
   Growing pressure from within is coming from both the political and
   military leadership; growing pressure from without is coming from
   Ukraine’s key partners.

   The battle is largely being played out in the Western media. Most
   intimately, Zelensky has faced criticism from his political inner
   circle. TIME magazine reports that some of the president’s advisors
   have become worried that his “belief in Ukraine’s ultimate victory over
   Russia . . . “verg[es] on the messianic.” One of Zelensky’s “closest
   aides” said that Zelensky “deludes himself.” The aide complained,
   “We’re out of options. We’re not winning. But try telling him that.”

   Some Zelensky aides say his intransigence hampers Ukraine’s ability to
   adapt to the changed reality on the battlefield and worry that
   negotiating a settlement with Russia remains “taboo.”

   Domestic criticism is also coming from the top levels of the military.
   Zelensky is reportedly in conflict with his generals over the conduct
   of the counteroffensive and over his demands to defend Bakhmut and
   Avdiivka at any cost, which the military leadership sees as a strategic
   mistake that is already hurting Ukraine dearly in soldiers and
   equipment.

   A senior Ukrainian military officer said that orders from the
   president’s office are, at times, disconnected from the battlefield
   reality and defended some front-line commanders who have begun
   second-guessing and refusing “orders from the top.”

   Zelensky’s struggle with his generals intensified on November 3 when
   Zelensky fired General Viktor Khorenko, the commander of Ukraine’s
   special operations forces. The commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian
   army, General Valery Zaluzhny, did not request his dismissal. The New
   York Times reports that “It was unclear whether General Zaluzhny, the
   overall commander of Ukraine’s forces, knew in advance of the planned
   dismissal” and that “[t]he firing appeared to undercut General
   Zaluzhny’s authority.”

   The firing took U.S. military officers, who “described a close and
   effective working relationship with” Khorenko, by surprise. Khorenko’s
   special operations forces had had some success with long-range strikes
   and sabotage operations behind Russian lines. But the NYT reports that
   there had been tension over what the military had “perceived as
   politically guided decisions on strategy” that had been ineffective and
   costly.

   Zelensky’s tensions with his generals reached a peak with Zaluzhny’s
   November 1 interview with The Economist. He asserted that the war had
   reached a “stalemate.” He conceded that “There will most likely be no
   deep and beautiful breakthrough.”

   What’s worse is that Zaluzhny implied that the stalemate would evolve
   into defeat for Ukraine. A stalemate entails a long war of attrition.
   In a companion essay published simultaneously by The Economist, he
   explained that a long war “as a rule, in most cases, is beneficial to
   one of the parties to the conflict. In our particular case, it is the
   russian [sic] federation, as it gives it the opportunity to
   reconstitute and build up its military power.”

   Zaluzhny said that in a prolonged war, Ukraine will run out of the
   “required volume” of missiles and ammunition while Russia, despite
   sanctions, is increasing its production capabilities. And even if it
   didn’t run out of weapons, he added, it will run out of men: a war of
   attrition “leads to the lack of Ukraine's ability to achieve
   superiority over the enemy in reserves by increasing their number.” A
   close Zelensky aide told TIME that, even if the United States gave
   Ukraine all the weapons it needed, Kyiv doesn’t “have the men to use
   them.”

   Zelensky’s office censured Zaluzhny, saying it “eases the work” of
   Russia and stirs “panic” among Ukraine’s Western partners. The New York
   Times calls the censure “a striking public rebuke that signaled an
   emerging rift between the military and civilian leadership.”

   In addition to the pressure coming from within Zelensky’s inner
   political and military circle, diplomatic pressure is also coming from
   Zelensky’s international partners.

   A November 3 NBC News article reported that “U.S. and European
   officials have begun quietly talking to the Ukrainian government about
   what possible peace negotiations with Russia might entail to end the
   war.” The article went on to say, citing one current and one former
   senior U.S. official familiar with the discussions, that “the
   conversations have included very broad outlines of what Ukraine might
   need to give up to reach a deal.”

   The quiet talks suggest agreement by the U.S. and its European allies
   with Zaluzhny that Ukraine may not achieve its goals on the
   battlefield, that the realization of their aspirations may continue to
   dim with prolonged battle, and that some concessions may need to be
   made.

   There is a remarkable convergence in the language used by the U.S. and
   European officials and the language used by Zaluzhny and Zelensky’s
   aides. NBC reports that the conversations “began amid concerns among
   U.S. and European officials that the war has reached a stalemate.” NBC
   reports that, like Zaluzhny, “[s]ome U.S. military officials have
   privately begun using the term ‘stalemate’ to describe the current
   battle in Ukraine.”

   Like Zaluzhny and Zelensky’s aides, “Biden administration officials
   also are worried that Ukraine is running out of forces.” According to
   “people familiar with the matter,” NBC reported, “President Joe Biden
   has been intensely focused on Ukraine’s depleting military forces.”
   “Manpower,” one of those sources is quoted as saying, “is at the top of
   the administration’s concerns right now.”

   Echoing the “close Zelensky aide” quoted in TIME, the same source said,
   “The U.S. and its allies can provide Ukraine with weaponry, but if they
   don’t have competent forces to use them it doesn’t do a lot of good.”

   These concerns, NBC reported, have led U.S. officials to concede
   privately that “Ukraine likely only has until the end of the year or
   shortly thereafter before more urgent discussions about peace
   negotiations should begin.”

   That leaves only a couple of months. With the battlefield turning
   against Ukraine despite Zelensky’s intransigent “belief in Ukraine’s
   ultimate victory over Russia,” the pressure targeted at Zelensky seems
   to be building, from both within and without,, to turn to the
   diplomatic front and face the beginning of the end of the war.

   Israel-Hamas deal: Talking vs. bombing, works

Israel-Hamas deal: Talking vs. bombing, works

   Trita Parsi

   Middle East

   The agreement reached today between Israel and Hamas — and brokered by
   Qatar and Egypt — is an important first step that will hopefully give
   all sides an opportunity to step back from the precipice of a larger
   regional conflagration, and to consider options for ending this war
   other than by the military destruction of one another.

   The return of the hostages to Israel in exchange for the return of
   Palestinian prisoners is welcome news and hopefully will proceed
   through subsequent cycles until all the hostages have been returned.
   The exchange proves that solutions can only be found through diplomacy
   through the help of actors in the region who can talk to all sides, in
   this case, Qatar and Egypt.

   This agreement should also serve as a wake-up call to the United States
   about the viability of a ceasefire, in both policy and political terms.
   President Joe Biden could and should have used political leverage
   sooner to secure this deal. For the sake of the Israeli hostages, for
   the sake of the thousands of Palestinian civilians who have been killed
   by this delay, and for the sake of the longer-term peace: Every
   Palestinian or Israeli child or civilian killed pushes peace further
   and further into the future.

   And finally, for the sake of preventing a widening of the war that
   could drag the US into yet another military conflict in the Middle
   East.

   It is crucial that this agreement is not treated by Biden as an
   alternative to a ceasefire. Rather, it must be treated as the first
   step towards it.

   If it amounts to nothing more than a prelude to a resumption of the
   military campaign and a continuation of the siege, it will not make
   much of a difference in stemming the larger humanitarian crisis,
   preventing a regional war, or paving the way for real peace.

   The U.S. has already lost significant international standing through
   its opposition to a ceasefire. If Biden fails to press all parties for
   a ceasefire after the prisoner swap, America’s global standing will
   plummet even further, which will have dire consequences for the U.S.,
   including in Ukraine.

   US strikes in Iraq show risk of escalation to wider war

US strikes in Iraq show risk of escalation to wider war

   Adam Weinstein

   QiOSK

   The United States has conducted two retaliatory airstrikes against
   Iraqi militias this week after ballistic missile attacks against
   America’s Al Asad Air Base, the latest in a troubling tit-for-tat
   between the U.S. and Iran-backed militias in the region that was
   triggered by the Israel-Hamas conflict.

   CENTCOM appears to believe that the status quo of attack and reprisal
   with Iraqi militias is sustainable. There’s an assumption that
   Washington, Iran, and Iraq’s militias understand each other’s red
   lines. However, this assumption comes with a lot of risks.

   The potential for one-upmanship between various Shi’a militias, each
   trying to prove they’re more hostile toward Americans than the others,
   is a concerning possibility. A deadly attack on U.S. troops could
   prompt the Biden administration to respond more forcefully, especially
   in an election year. What is the administration’s plan to manage
   escalation and prevent a larger regional war (with heavy U.S.
   involvement) if this were to occur?

   While the timing and scale of the war in Gaza may have been
   unpredictable, it was always evident that the presence of scattered
   U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria posed a risk of escalating the U.S. into
   greater conflict in such an unpredictable region. That’s why I’ve long
   argued for rethinking America’s military posture in Iraq, including in
   new research this year exploring how Washington could conduct a phased
   withdrawal of troops and successfully recalibrate our approach to the
   country and region.

   It is true that the presence of U.S. military advisors in Iraq helps
   maintain cohesion and a working relationship between competing factions
   of Iraq’s military. U.S. troops also offer critical capabilities in the
   fight to contain ISIS. But it is time for Washington to consider
   whether these benefits are outweighed by the risk of malign actors
   using U.S. troops to provoke a wider conflict – either intentionally or
   inadvertently.

   While the risks of keeping U.S. troops in Iraq are apparent, the
   overall utility of their presence is unclear (particularly in deterring
   attacks on themselves). With each new day comes a fresh opportunity for
   crisis. It’s past time Washington grappled with the true costs and
   benefits of our military presence.

   JFK: A man on the brink of revelation

JFK: A man on the brink of revelation

   Lora Lumpe

   QiOSK

   Sixty years ago today, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in
   Dallas, Texas.

   According to his biographer, Arthur Schlesinger, Kennedy’s thinking had
   evolved in the year before his killing. In an obituary in The Saturday
   Evening Post on December 14, 1963, Schlesinger said this about the
   president in those last months:

   “What preoccupied him most, I believe, was the peace of the world and
   the future of mankind. His historian’s perspective made him see the
   conflict with Communism not as a holy war but as a difficult and
   perilous struggle for adjustment and accommodation. The world, he
   deeply believed, was in its nature and its historical movement a
   diverse world — a world which had room for great diversity of economic
   systems, of political creeds, of philosophic faiths. He respected the
   distinctive values and traditions, the distinctive identities, of other
   nations and other societies.

   Above all, life must survive on this planet. He knew what nuclear war
   would mean, and he believed that the avoidance of such a war was the
   common interest of mankind — a common interest which must transcend all
   conflicts of ideology and national ambition. This common interest was
   the bridge across the dark abyss. His deepest purpose was to strengthen
   that bridge against storms of suspicion and fear, and to persuade his
   adversaries that, if each nation and people respected the integrity of
   the rest and accepted the reality of the world of diversity, if nations
   abandoned a messianic effort to remake the world in their own image,
   peace would be possible, and humanity would endure."

   This is a far cry from President Joe Biden’s "good vs evil" and
   "dictators vs. democrats" rhetoric of today. Interestingly, it bears
   resemblance to Chinese President Xi Jinping's comment last week when
   meeting with Biden:

   "Planet Earth is big enough for the two countries to succeed, and one
   country’s success is an opportunity for the other. It is an objective
   fact that China and the United States are different in history,
   culture, social system, and development path. However, as long as they
   respect each other, coexist in peace, and pursue win-win cooperation,
   they will be fully capable of rising above differences and find the
   right way for the two major countries to get along with each other."

   It is also worth noting that Kennedy only five months before Dallas had
   given what some have called one of the most enduring speeches of his
   time. On June 10, 1963, he asked the American University commencement
   audience, “what kind of peace do we seek?”

   "So, let us not be blind to our differences but let us also direct
   attention to our common interests and to the means by which those
   differences can be resolved. And if we cannot end now our differences,
   at least we can help make the world safe for diversity. For, in the
   final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this
   small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our
   children's future. And we are all mortal."

   Sixty years and more than a generation ago these words held promise,
   then seemingly lost amid the chaos of assassination, and war. There is
   no cost to resurfacing them now, in a world no less uncertain.
