   Here is the situation on Sunday, October 15, 2023.

Fighting

     * Two people were killed in Russian attacks on the eastern Ukrainian
       town of Avdiivka, officials said, and two others were killed in
       shelling of Beryslav city in Ukraine’s Kherson region.
     * Russian forces continued their assault on Avdiivka, repeatedly
       shelling the town and launching ground operations in one of the few
       offensives by Russian forces in months.

     * Ukraine’s military said it had withstood 15 Russian ground attacks
       mounted in the vicinity of Avdiivka, Tonenke and Pervomaiske in the
       Donetsk region. The fierce Russian onslaught around Avdiivka has been
       described as a new offensive by Moscow.
     * Ukraine military spokesperson Oleksandr Stupun said Avdiivka was now a
       key objective for Russian forces to take “because it is the only
       chance to show some kind of victory. They have no other options.”
     * Almost 30 Ukrainian combat drones were shot down by Russian air
       defences over Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions. Two additional
       drones were shot down over the Black Sea near the southern Russian
       resort city of Sochi. There were no reports of casualties immediately.
     * Russia’s Black Sea Fleet conducted drills using rocket launchers off
       the port city of Sevastopol in the Russian-annexed Crimean Peninsula.

Regional security

     * The White House accused North Korea of delivering more than 1,000
       containers of military equipment and munitions to Russia for its
       ongoing war in Ukraine. Washington released images that it said showed
       the containers being loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship before being
       moved by train to southwestern Russia. North Korea has previously
       denied providing weaponry to Moscow.

Diplomacy

     * Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet China’s Xi Jinping at the
       Belt and Road Forum in Beijing on October 17-18. Putin’s visit to
       China is his first international trip since The Hague-based
       International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant for his arrest in
       March for war crimes related to the deportation of children from
       Ukraine.

     * Armenian President Vahagn Khachaturyan ratified the ICC statutes, his
       office said.
     * Ukrainian human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said the Foreign
       Ministry in Kyiv sent a note of protest to Israel after Ukrainian
       citizens were unable to evacuate from war-torn Gaza. Lubinets said
       Ukraine could not understand why its citizens, and those of other
       countries, were not allowed to evacuate from besieged and bombarded
       Gaza. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been a vocal
       supporter of Israel in its war on Gaza.

Sanctions

     * World Athletics President Sebastian Coe said the International Olympic
       Committee (IOC) had made the “only decision left open” in suspending
       Russia’s national Olympic body for violating the territorial integrity
       of Ukraine. The IOC decision came after Russia’s Olympic Committee
       this week officially recognised regional sporting organisations from
       four Ukrainian territories annexed by Russia since its invasion of
       Ukraine began in 2022.
