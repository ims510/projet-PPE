   By James Waterhouse
   BBC Ukraine Correspondent

   Galina was born in Ukraine. She speaks Ukrainian, her husband is serving
   in the Ukrainian army, and she lives in a village south of the central
   Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia.

   But Galina is legally Russian. As a child, she moved there, where she then
   became a citizen.

   It means she - like thousands of other Russians in Ukraine - is now in a
   legal limbo.

   "When you show your documents, people think you're something strange," she
   tells me in her kitchen, where she spends her time stitching T-shirts for
   wounded Ukrainian soldiers.

   Ukraine's state migration service insists that all foreigners in Ukraine
   have equal rights as each other, and no one nationality is discriminated
   against.

   But some allege this isn't the case. Lawyers working with Russians in
   Ukraine for instance told the BBC their clients face having their accounts
   frozen.

   After Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Ukraine's National Bank
   restricted financial services for all Russian and Belarusian citizens,
   although it says those with a residence permit are not affected.

   Galina disagrees. She says that because of her passport, she can't get a
   job, and fears her bank account could be blocked.

   She is seven months pregnant but because she's not legally Ukrainian, she
   can't access free state health services.

   Galina also worries she won't be able to register her child's birth: after
   she married her Ukrainian husband Maksym in a church, she says that
   officials refused to recognise the union because of her unsettled status.

   "They said, 'Come back when you have a passport'," explains Galina. "They
   can't understand who I am." Under Ukrainian law it's banned to have joint
   citizenship, although some do.

   because of Galina's unsettled status

   She started applying to become a Ukrainian citizen but was unable to
   complete the process because of Russia's full-scale invasion. Now Galina's
   temporary Ukrainian passport has expired, she says she feels like a
   "hostage of Russia".

   "Changing passports was difficult even before the war - now it's
   impossible," she says.

   On Povitroflotskyi Avenue in central Kyiv sits a three-storey white
   building with an overgrown garden. It's surrounded by a tall, barbed wire
   fence and the shutters are firmly down.

   They have been since 23 February last year when staff at the Russian
   Embassy evacuated for "safety reasons". A day later Moscow launched its
   full-scale invasion, and what was left of the diplomatic relations between
   Kyiv and Moscow disintegrated.

   It means thousands of people in Ukraine, like Galina, are living in
   uncertainty.

   Currently there are more than 150,000 Russians with permanent residency
   permits in Ukraine. Around 17,000 have temporary ones.

   For them to successfully apply for a Ukrainian passport or citizenship,
   they first need to physically give up their Russian citizenship. Moscow
   made that process complicated: to do so, they'd have to surrender their
   papers in either a Russian consulate abroad, or Russia itself.

   There are no guarantees Galina wouldn't be arrested in the process, or end
   up stranded outside Ukraine.

   invasion

   As Galina's children arrive back from school, you can see the anguish in
   her eyes. An anxiety she attempts to hide from her children.

   But she refuses to hold Ukraine accountable, or to claim discrimination.

   She pins all her blame on Russia for her situation, as well as her Russian
   family members who've chosen to support their country in its so-called
   "special military operation".

   "How can I support a robber, a rapist and a murderer who breaks into my
   home?" she says.

   After Galina finishes a video call with her husband Maksym, I ask her what
   would happen to her family if he was killed on the front line.

   She puts her hand over her mouth. A thought she's tried to put to the back
   of her mind, suddenly at the forefront.

   "It's very scary," she says. "Even if he gets wounded, I wouldn't be able
   to visit him in hospital, because we're not technically married."

   "To the rest of the world we're strangers."

'I chose Ukraine'

   When Anastasia Leonova, a Russian, moved from Moscow to Kyiv in 2015, her
   friends warned her she "wouldn't be allowed to speak Russian" and that
   "there were only Nazis there".

   It was a Russian propaganda narrative which annoyed her, as she had uncles
   and cousins living in Ukraine.

   Anastasia's relocation followed her online criticism of Russia's 2014
   annexation of Crimea and backing of separatist militants, which led to her
   losing her job in Russia as well as receiving death threats.

   On 24 February last year, as Russian troops moved towards Kyiv, Anastasia
   says she only had one thought in her mind - to stay and fight.

   "My blood is part Ukrainian," she says. "I was born as a part of Ukraine."

   "I chose Ukraine as my homeland; I could not betray this choice".

   She volunteered to be a combat medic with Ukrainian forces, as they
   defended the capital against troops from her own country.

   I ask whether she's treated differently for being Russian.

   "Nobody was asking for my passport when I was working," she says with a
   smile.

   "For sure, my colleagues know."

   them at an embassy or consulate

   She admits it was initially very difficult to treat wounded Russians
   because of what they were doing.

   But later, she says, she realised that treating them was "the way to get
   our people back, the Ukrainians who were captured by the Russians".

   "Since I came here from my first day, I've been dreaming of having a
   Ukrainian passport," she says.

   "This is what I'm fighting for. Not only for freedom, but for my
   passport."

   Only a few hundred Russians have been granted Ukrainian citizenship in the
   18 months since the full-scale invasion, down from 1,700 the year before.

   Unlike Galina, Anastasia feels she's closer to her dream. Serving the army
   has likely helped her cause.

   Military service, marriage to a Ukrainian and length of residency are all
   considered in citizenship applications. As the authorities point out,
   having the legal right to stay in Ukraine requires more than just a change
   in identity.

   This war has put thousands of Russians like Galina and Anastasia in a
   difficult position within Ukraine.

   The head of Ukraine's State Migration Service, Natalia Naumenko, told us
   no nationality is discriminated against when it comes to gaining
   citizenship.

   A new law is being drafted which would simplify citizenship and residency
   applications for those fighting for Ukraine.

   But Ms Naumenko points out that thanks to the full-scale invasion, the
   process certainly won't be made easier for Russians.

   "We have already simplified it for those who are fighting for Ukraine,"
   she says.

   "Why does Ukraine have to simplify it for all Russians in general?"
