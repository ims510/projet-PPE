Afternoon summary

   As it turns 6pm in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, here’s a roundup of today’s
   news so far:
     * Russia launched waves of drone attacks on Kyiv overnight, the head
       of the Ukrainian capital’s military administration said. Serhiy
       Popko said on Sunday that, according to preliminary information,
       Ukraine’s air defence systems hit about 10 Iranian-made Shahed
       kamikaze drones in Kyiv and its outskirts.
     * Ukrainian troops have pushed Russian forces ‘3km to 8km’ back from
       the banks of the Dnipro River. “Preliminary figures vary from three
       to eight kilometres, depending on the specifics, geography and
       landscape design of the left bank,” the army spokesperson Natalia
       Gumenyuk told Ukrainian television, without specifying whether
       Ukraine’s military had complete control of the area or whether the
       Russians had retreated.
     * Five people have been injured in shelling on Kherson, said the
       Ukrainian interior minister. A three-year-old girl was among those
       injured after artillery shelling, said Ihor Klymenko.
     * The pro-war Russian nationalist Igor Girkin has said he wants to
       run for president. Girkin, who is in custody awaiting trial for
       inciting extremism, said on Sunday he wanted to run even though he
       understood the March election would be a “sham” with the winner
       already clear.
     * Russia has said Ukraine attempted to attack Bogorodsky area, near
       Moscow, using a drone, with Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, saying
       later on Telegram that the foiled attack “did not cause any damage
       or casualties”.
     * A Ukrainian orphan taken from Mariupol after Russian forces
       captured the Ukrainian city in the first weeks of its invasion has
       returned home, Kyiv said on Sunday.
     * Vladimir Putin is reportedly going to attend the G20 virtual summit
       on Wednesday, hosted by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi.

   More on Vladimir Putin’s possible attendance at the G20 virtual summit
   after he skipped the in-person meeting in New Delhi in September.

   The Russian president did not travel to the last two G20 meetings –
   hosted by India in September and Indonesia last year, sending his
   foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in his place.

   In a statement on Saturday, India said its prime minister, Narendra
   Modi, would chair a virtual summit on Wednesday to “take forward key,
   select outcomes/action points from the New Delhi summit”.

   Putin has taken few trips outside Russia since the international
   criminal court issued an arrest warrant for him over the unlawful
   deportation of Ukrainian children.

Ukrainian teen taken from Mariupol returned home

   A Ukrainian orphan taken from Mariupol after Russian forces captured
   the Ukrainian city in the first weeks of its invasion has returned
   home, Kyiv said on Sunday.

   The case of Bogdan Yermokhin, who turned 18 on Sunday, made
   international headlines after Russia issued him a draft summons to
   report for mandatory military conscription before his 18th birthday.

   It was announced he would return on 10 November and today Kyiv said he
   had made it back to Ukraine after a series of negotiations involving
   officials in Moscow, Kyiv and Belarus.

   “Our team managed to bring home Bogdan Yermokhin, a Ukrainian boy who
   was taken by Russia from occupied Mariupol to the Moscow region,” said
   Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff.

   The Kremlin has been accused of illegally transferring thousands of
   Ukrainian children to Russia, and the international criminal court has
   issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin over the alleged
   deportations.

   Yermokhin’s return was brokered by Qatar and the UN children’s agency,
   Unicef, said Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets in a
   social media post.

   He also published a photo of Yermokhin holding a Ukrainian flag at the
   border.

     Together with other state authorities, the team of the Office of the
     Ombudsman worked out a way to return the boy within the framework of

Russia says Ukraine attempted to attack Bogorodsky area, near Moscow, using a
drone

   “An attempt by the Kyiv regime to carry out a terrorist attack using a
   drone against facilities of the Russian Federation was thwarted,” the
   Russian defence ministry said in a statement.

   Ukrainian drone attacks on Moscow were particularly frequent in the
   spring, before the launch of its counteroffensive in June, but they
   have been rare in recent weeks.

   According to the Russian ministry, the drone in question “was destroyed
   by the air defence equipment … over the territory of the Bogorodsky
   urban district, in the Moscow region”.

   Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said later on Telegram that the foiled
   attack “did not cause any damage or casualties”.

   Ukrainian authorities said two first responders were killed and at
   least seven people injured in Russian rocket strikes on the
   south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia on Saturday.

   The attacks came as Kyiv’s air force said Russia fired 38 drones at its
   territory overnight – the highest reported number in more than six
   weeks.

   Ukrainian police said Russia fired a series of rocket strikes at the
   village of Komyshuvakha, close to the frontline in the Zaporizhzhia
   region, which Russia annexed last year.

   “As a result of the first two strikes, four local residents were
   injured and a fire broke out in a residential building,” they said in a
   statement.

   “When the police and rescuers arrived at the scene, Russians conducted
   another strike. Two emergency service workers were killed, and three
   more were injured.”

Pro-war Russian nationalist Igor Girkin says he wants to run for president

   The pro-war Russian nationalist Igor Girkin, who is in custody awaiting
   trial for inciting extremism, said on Sunday he wanted to run for
   president even though he understood the March election would be a
   “sham” with the winner already clear.

   Girkin, who is also known by the alias Igor Strelkov, has repeatedly
   said Russia faces revolution and even civil war unless Vladimir Putin’s
   military leadership fights the war in Ukraine more effectively.

   A former Federal Security Service officer who helped Russia to annex
   Crimea in 2014 and then to organise pro-Russia militias in eastern
   Ukraine, Girkin said before his arrest that he and his supporters were
   entering politics.

   “I understand perfectly well that in the current situation in Russia,
   participating in the presidential campaign is like sitting down at a
   table to play with card sharps,” Girkin said in a letter published by
   his account on Telegram.

   Girkin said he did not think he would be allowed to take part in the
   election, but hoped that his attempt to unite patriotic forces would
   disrupt the Kremlin’s plan for a “sham election” in which “the only
   winner is known in advance”.

   “This is our chance to unite in the face of external and internal
   threats,” Girkin said in the post, which was titled: “I am going to
   run.”

   The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said in an interview published
   on Friday that he hoped Putin would run in the March election for
   another term as president, a move that would keep Putin in power until
   at least 2030.

   summit this week, the state TV presenter Pavel Zarubin said on his
   Telegram channel.

   If this happens, it would be the “first event in a long time” in which
   both Putin and western leaders have participated, Zarubin said.

   According to the RIA Novosti news agency, the summit will be held on
   Wednesday.

Ukrainian army pushes Russians ‘3km to 8km’ away from Dnipro River

   The Ukrainian army said on Sunday that it had pushed Russian forces
   back “three to eight kilometres” from the banks of the Dnipro River,
   which if confirmed would be the first meaningful advance by Kyiv’s
   forces months into a disappointing counteroffensive.

   “Preliminary figures vary from three to eight kilometres, depending on
   the specifics, geography and landscape design of the left bank,” the
   army spokesperson Natalia Gumenyuk told Ukrainian television, without
   specifying whether Ukraine’s military had complete control of the area
   or if the Russians had retreated.

   “The enemy still continues artillery fire on the right bank,” she said,
   estimating that “several tens of thousands” of Russian troops were in
   the area.

   “We have a lot of work to do,” she added.

Five people injured in shelling on Kherson, says Ukrainian interior minister

   Five people including a three-year-old girl were injured in Russian
   artillery shelling of Kherson on Sunday morning, the Ukrainian interior
   minister, Ihor Klymenko, said.

   “All of them sustained shrapnel wounds. The child and the grandmother
   were walking in the yard. Enemy artillery hit them near the entrance,”
   Klymenko said on the Telegram messaging app.

Ukrainian troops trying to push back Russian forces on east bank of Dnipro
River

   And now a latest update on the fight at the Dnipro River, where
   Ukrainian troops were aiming to push back Russian forces positioned on
   the east bank, the Ukrainian military says, according to the AP.

   The wide river is a natural dividing line along the southern
   battlefront. Since withdrawing from the city of Kherson and retreating
   across the river a year ago, Moscow’s forces have regularly shelled
   communities on the Ukrainian-held side of the river to prevent Kyiv’s
   troops from advancing toward Russia-annexed Crimea.

   The Ukrainians are trying to “push back Russian army units as far as
   possible in order to make life easier for the (western) bank of the
   Kherson region, so that they get shelled less,” Natalia Humeniuk, the
   spokesperson for Ukraine’s Southern Operational Command, said.

   In response, the Russian military used “tactical aviation”, including
   Iranian-made Shahed exploding drones, to try to pin down Ukraine’s
   troops, Humeniuk said.

   The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said its troops there had
   repelled 12 attacks by the Russian army between Friday and Saturday,
   the AP reports.

Drones attacked Kyiv in waves, says head of capital's military administration

   More now on those drone attacks reported in Kyiv.

   Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, explained why
   raid alerts were announced several times in the Ukrainian capital.

   “The enemy’s UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] were launched in many
   groups and attacked Kyiv in waves, from different directions, at the
   same time constantly changing the vectors of movement along the route,”
   he said, quoted by Reuters.

   After a pause of 52 days, Moscow has resumed airstrikes on Kyiv. On
   Saturday, Ukrainian officials said all drones heading towards Kyiv were
   destroyed, but some hit infrastructure elsewhere in Ukraine.

   Popko said on Sunday that according to preliminary information
   Ukraine’s air defence systems hit about 10 Iranian-made Shahed kamikaze
   drones in Kyiv and its outskirts.

   Reuters could not independently verify the reports and there was no
   immediate comment from Russia.

Russia launches waves of drone attacks on Kyiv early on Sunday

   Hello, this is the Guardian’s live coverage of the Russian war against
   Ukraine.

   Russia launched several waves of drone attacks on Kyiv early on Sunday
   for the second night in row, stepping up its assaults on the Ukrainian
   capital after several weeks of pause, the city’s military
   administration said.

   There were no initial reports of “critical damage” or casualties, said
   Serhiy Popko, the head of the Kyiv’s military administration, quoted by
   Reuters.

   Here are some more developments:
     * Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has sanctioned 37 Russian
       groups and 108 people including a former prime minister and a
       former education minister and said he aimed to fight wartime
       abductions of children from Ukraine and other “Russian terror”.
     * Ukrainian officials said on Saturday that its armed forces shot
       down 29 of 38 drones in an overnight raid. More than 400 towns and
       villages in the south, south-east and north of the country were
       affected by the drone attacks, including an oil refinery that was
       hit in Odesa.
     * Ukrainian troops are working to push back Russian forces positioned
       on the east bank of the Dnipro River, the military has said, a day
       after Ukraine claimed to have secured bridgeheads on that side of
       the river that divides the country’s partially occupied Kherson
       region.

     * Ukraine’s armed forces claimed to have killed a further 620 Russian
       soldiers on Friday during operations. In response, Russia has said
       it had heavily bombed Ukrainian forces near the Dnipro River and
       killed about 75 soldiers.
     * Two Ukrainian emergency workers were killed in the Zaporizhzhia
       region by Russian rocket attacks on Saturday. Ukrainian police said
       seven people were also injured when Russia fired a series of rocket
       strikes at the village of Komyshuvakha, close to the frontline in
       the Zaporizhzhia region, which Russia claimed to have annexed last
       year.
     * In an intelligence briefing, the UK’s Ministry of Defence noted
       Russian forces were suffering “particularly heavy casualties” in
       fighting around Avdiivka, one of three areas seeing heavy ground
       fighting. Despite the heavy fighting, the MoD said neither side was
       making significant progress.
     * Hungary must say no to the current Europe model built in Brussels,
       the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, told a congress of his Fidesz
       party on Saturday, as his government continues to object to Ukraine
       joining the EU.
     * The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has called on the Russian
       president, Vladimir Putin, to take the first step towards a
       peaceful resolution to the conflict in Ukraine by withdrawing
       troops.

   president this week in Berlin.

     * More than 100 Russian doctors have signed a joint letter calling on
       Putin to release a woman jailed for a supermarket protest against
       the war in Ukraine. A St Petersburg court last week sentenced
       Alexandra Skochilenko, 33, to seven years in prison for spreading
       “false information” after she swapped supermarket price tags with
       slogans criticising Russia’s offensive in Ukraine.
     * Ukraine has been the target of nearly 4,000 cyber-attacks since the
       invasion began, three times higher than before, according to
       Ukrainian officials who oversee cyber defences.
