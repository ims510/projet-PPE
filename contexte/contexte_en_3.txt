   In all ages war has been an important topic of analysis. In the latter

   on the subject than ever before. Endeavours to understand the nature of
   war, to formulate some theory of its causes, conduct, and prevention,
   are of great importance, for theory shapes human expectations and
   determines human behaviour. The various schools of theorists are
   generally aware of the profound influence they can exercise upon life,
   and their writings usually include a strong normative element, for,

   The analysis of war may be divided into several categories.
   Philosophical, political, economic, technological, legal, sociological,

   analytical categories employed by the theoretician, but most of the
   actual theories are mixed because war is an extremely complex social
   phenomenon that cannot be explained by any single factor or through any
   single approach.

   Reflecting changes in the international system, theories of war have
   passed through several phases in the course of the past three
   centuries. After the ending of the wars of religion, about the middle
   of the 17th century, wars were fought for the interests of individual
   sovereigns and were limited both in their objectives and in their
   scope. The art of maneuver became decisive, and analysis of war was
   couched accordingly in terms of strategies. The situation changed
--
   increased the size of forces from small professional to large conscript
   armies and broadened the objectives of war to the ideals of the
   revolution, ideals that appealed to the masses who were subject to
   conscription. In the relative order of post-Napoleonic Europe, the
   mainstream of theory returned to the idea of war as a rational, limited
   instrument of national policy. This approach was best articulated by
--
   conflict, and it led to a renewal of other theories. These no longer
   regarded war as a rational instrument of state policy. The theorists
   held that war, in its modern, total form, if still conceived as a
   national state instrument, should be undertaken only if the most vital
   interests of the state, touching upon its very survival, are concerned.
   Otherwise, warfare serves broad ideologies and not the more narrowly
   defined interests of a sovereign or a nation. Like the religious wars
   of the 17th century, war becomes part of “grand designs,” such as the
   rising of the proletariat in communist eschatology or the Nazi doctrine
   of a master race.
   Some theoreticians have gone even further, denying war any rational
   character whatsoever. To them war is a calamity and a social disaster,
   whether it is afflicted by one nation upon another or conceived of as
--
   contemporary form of theorizing that combines analysis of the origins
   of warfare with a strong normative element aiming at its prevention.
   Peace research concentrates on two areas: the analysis of the
   international system and the empirical study of the phenomenon of war.

   World War II and the subsequent evolution of weapons of mass
   destruction made the task of understanding the nature of war even more
   urgent. On the one hand, war had become an intractable social
   phenomenon, the elimination of which seemed to be an essential
   precondition for the survival of mankind. On the other hand, the use of
   war as an instrument of policy was calculated in an unprecedented
   manner by the nuclear superpowers, the United States and the Soviet

   Arab nations. Thinking about war, consequently, became increasingly
   more differentiated because it had to answer questions related to very

   Clausewitz cogently defines war as a rational instrument of foreign
   policy: “an act of violence intended to compel our opponent to fulfill
   our will.” Modern definitions of war, such as “armed conflict between
   political units,” generally disregard the narrow, legalistic
   definitions characteristic of the 19th century, which limited the
   concept to formally declared war between states. Such a definition
   includes civil wars but at the same time excludes such phenomena as
   insurrections, banditry, or piracy. Finally, war is generally
   understood to embrace only armed conflicts on a fairly large scale,
