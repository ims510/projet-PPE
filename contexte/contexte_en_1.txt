   Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of
   war, or of wars in general.^[2] Total war is warfare that is not
   restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in
   massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties.

Types of warfare
   Main article: Types of war
     * Asymmetric warfare is the methods used in conflicts between
       belligerents of drastically different levels of military capability
       or size.^[23]
     * Biological warfare, or germ warfare, is the use of biological
       infectious agents or toxins such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi

       pathogens.
     * Chemical warfare involves the use of weaponized chemicals in
       combat. Poison gas as a chemical weapon was principally used during
--
       including more than 100,000 civilians.^[26]
     * Cold warfare is an intense international rivalry without direct
       military conflict, but with a sustained threat of it, including
--
       development, and may involve active conflicts by indirect means,
       such as economic warfare, political warfare, covert operations,
       espionage, cyberwarfare, or proxy wars.
     * Conventional warfare is declared war between states in which
       nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons are not used or see
       limited deployment.
     * Cyberwarfare involves the actions by a nation-state or
       international organization to attack and attempt to damage another

       undermining the insurgents' claims against the incumbent regime.
     * Information warfare is the application of destructive force on a
       large scale against information assets and systems, against the
--
       transportation).^[27]
     * Nuclear warfare is warfare in which nuclear weapons are the
       primary, or a major, method of achieving capitulation.
     * Total war is warfare by any means possible, disregarding the laws
       of war, placing no limits on legitimate military targets, using
       weapons and tactics resulting in significant civilian casualties,
       or demanding a war effort requiring significant sacrifices by the
       friendly civilian population.

   Entities contemplating going to war and entities considering whether to
   end a war may formulate war aims as an evaluation/propaganda tool. War
   aims may stand as a proxy for national-military resolve.^[28]
  Definition
   Fried defines war aims as "the desired territorial, economic, military
   or other benefits expected following successful conclusion of a
   war".^[29]
  Classification
   Tangible/intangible aims:
     * Tangible war aims may involve (for example) the acquisition of
       territory (as in the German goal of Lebensraum in the first half of
--
       the Anglo-Dutch Wars).
     * Intangible war aims – like the accumulation of credibility or
       reputation^[30] – may have more tangible expression ("conquest
--
   Explicit/implicit aims:
     * Explicit war aims may involve published policy decisions.
     * Implicit war aims^[32] can take the form of minutes of discussion,
       memoranda and instructions.^[33]
   Positive/negative aims:
     * "Positive war aims" cover tangible outcomes.
     * "Negative war aims" forestall or prevent undesired outcomes.^[34]
   War aims can change in the course of conflict and may eventually morph
   into "peace conditions"^[35] – the minimal conditions under which a
   state may cease to wage a particular war.

   The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of
   deaths since its start, is World War II, from 1939 to 1945, with
--
   60 million. As concerns a belligerent's losses in proportion to its
   prewar population, the most destructive war in modern history may have
   been the Paraguayan War (see Paraguayan War casualties). In 2013 war

   emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of prisoners
   of war or civilians.^[41]^[42]^[43] For instance, of the nine million
   people who were on the territory of the Byelorussian SSR in 1941, some
   1.6 million were killed by the Germans in actions away from
   battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 Jews,
   and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were
   unarmed civilians).^[44] Another byproduct of some wars is the
   prevalence of propaganda by some or all parties in the conflict,^[45]
   and increased revenues by weapons manufacturers.^[46]
   Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been
   waged in the last century. These are the two World Wars, followed by

   neighboring peoples. The death toll of World War II, being over
   60 million, surpasses all other war-death-tolls.^[47]

   military personnel. United States military casualties of war since 1775
   have totaled over two million. Of the 60 million European military

   Typically, war becomes intertwined with the economy and many wars are
   partially or entirely based on economic reasons. Following World War
   II, consensus opinion for many years amongst economists and historians
   was that war can stimulate a country's economy as evidenced by the
   U.S's emergence from the Great Depression,^[74] though modern economic
   analysis has thrown significant doubt on these views. In most cases,
   such as the wars of Louis XIV, the Franco-Prussian War, and World War
   I, warfare primarily results in damage to the economy of the countries
   involved. For example, Russia's involvement in World War I took such a
--
   belligerents cumulatively spent about a trillion U.S. dollars on the
   war effort (as adjusted to 1940 prices).^[76]^[77] The Great Depression
   of the 1930s ended as nations increased their production of war
   materials.^[78]
   By the end of the war, 70% of European industrial infrastructure was
   destroyed.^[79] Property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the

   expansion in Europe in 1566
   There are many theories about the motivations for war, but no consensus
   about which are most common.^[81] Military theorist Carl von Clausewitz
   said, "Every age has its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions,
   and its own peculiar preconceptions."^[82]
--
   or ideologies. By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the
   local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare.
   The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of Melanie Klein,
   thought war was the paranoid or projective "elaboration" of
   mourning.^[85] Fornari thought war and violence develop out of our
   "love need": our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which
   we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. For
   the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare.
   Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing
   willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over
--
   Despite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for
   self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war,
   few wars have originated from a desire for war among the general
   populace.^[86] Far more often the general population has been
   reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory that
   looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh.^[87] He argues the
   general populace is more neutral towards war and wars occur when
   leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are
   placed into power. War is caused by leaders who seek war such as
   Napoleon and Hitler. Such leaders most often come to power in times of
   crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the
   nation to war.
     Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor
     in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is

   Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are
   two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging in or after
   the Mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater
   population density and competition over resources; the other sees human
   warfare as a more ancient practice derived from common animal
   tendencies, such as territoriality and sexual competition.^[89]
   The latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found
   in many primate species such as chimpanzees,^[90] as well as in many
   ant species,^[91] group conflict may be a general feature of animal
   social behavior. Some proponents of the idea argue that war, while
   innate, has been intensified greatly by developments of technology and
   social organization such as weaponry and states.^[92]
   Psychologist and linguist Steven Pinker argued that war-related
   behaviors may have been naturally selected in the ancestral environment

   War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive
   international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets
   for natural resources and for wealth. War has also been linked to

   Main article: Marxist explanations of warfare
   The Marxist theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states all

   great (imperialist) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of
   capitalism. Marxist economists Karl Kautsky, Rosa Luxemburg, Rudolf

   This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called
   the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding

   that populations always increase until they are limited by war,
   disease, or famine.^[103]

  Cultural
   Geoffrey Parker argues that what distinguishes the "Western way of war"
   based in Western Europe chiefly allows historians to explain its
   extraordinary success in conquering most of the world after 1500:
     The Western way of war rests upon five principal foundations:
     technology, discipline, a highly aggressive military tradition, a
     remarkable capacity to innovate and to respond rapidly to the
     innovation of others and – from about 1500 onward – a unique system
     of war finance. The combination of all five provided a formula for
     military success....The outcome of wars has been determined less by
     technology, then by better war plans, the achievement of surprise,
     greater economic strength, and above all superior discipline.^[117]
--
   the best possible outcomes for themselves, and desire to avoid the
   costs of war.^[119] Under one game theory approach, rationalist
   theories posit all actors can bargain, would be better off if war did
   not occur, and likewise seek to understand why war nonetheless
   reoccurs. Under another rationalist game theory without bargaining, the
   peace war game, optimal strategies can still be found that depend upon
   number of iterations played. In "Rationalist Explanations for War",
   James Fearon examined three rationalist explanations for why some
   countries engage in war:
     * Issue indivisibilities

     * Commitment problems^[119]
   "Issue indivisibility" occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by
   bargaining, because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be

   countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not
   agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of
   state's victory or loss. For instance, Geoffrey Blainey argues that war
   is a result of miscalculation of strength. He cites historical examples
   of war and demonstrates, "war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic
   crisis which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting

  Political science
   The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by Lewis Fry Richardson
   following World War I. More recent databases of wars and armed conflict
   have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project, Peter Brecke and
   the Uppsala Conflict Data Program.^[127]
   The following subsections consider causes of war from system, societal,
   and individual levels of analysis. This kind of division was first
--
    1. Balance of power theory: States have the goal of preventing a
       single state from becoming a hegemon, and war is the result of the
       would-be hegemon's persistent attempts at power acquisition. In
       this view, an international system with more equal distribution of
       power is more stable, and "movements toward unipolarity are
       destabilizing."^[128]^: 147  However, evidence has shown power
       polarity is not actually a major factor in the occurrence of
       wars.^[128]^: 147–48 
    2. Power transition theory: Hegemons impose stabilizing conditions on
       the world order, but they eventually decline, and war occurs when a
       declining hegemon is challenged by another rising power or aims to
       preemptively suppress them.^[128]^: 148  On this view, unlike for
       balance-of-power theory, wars become more probable when power is

   Waterloo, by John Heaviside Clark, 1816
   The morality of war has been the subject of debate for thousands of
   years.^[131]
   The two principal aspects of ethics in war, according to the just war
   theory, are jus ad bellum and jus in bello.^[132]
   Jus ad bellum (right to war), dictates which unfriendly acts and
   circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another
   nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war:
   first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it
   must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit
--
   fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success;
   fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought
   must be proportional to means being used.^[133]^[134]
--
   – The Oxford Companion to World War II.^[135]
   Jus in bello (right in war), is the set of ethical rules when
   conducting war. The two main principles are proportionality and
   discrimination. Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and
--
   suffered.^[136] The principle of discrimination determines who are the
   legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation
   between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants,
   who it is not.^[136] Failure to follow these rules can result in the
   loss of legitimacy for the just-war-belligerent.^[137]
   The just war theory was foundational in the creation of the United
   Nations and in international law's regulations on legitimate war.^[131]
