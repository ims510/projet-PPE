   The 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was never implemented

   War announcing support for the establishment of a "national home for the
   Jewish people" in Palestine.^[27] The collision between those two

   [IMG]During the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel captured the West Bank, the
   Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights and the Sinai Peninsula. Each of these
   territories except the Sinai remain under Israeli occupation.
   The 1967 Six-Day War exerted a significant effect upon Palestinian
   nationalism, as Israel gained military control of the West Bank from

   Jordan, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and supported the
   Jordanian army during the War of Attrition, which included the Battle of
   Karameh. However, the Palestinian base in Jordan collapsed with the
   Jordanian–Palestinian civil war in 1970. The PLO defeat by the Jordanians
   caused most of the Palestinian militants to relocate to South Lebanon,
   where they soon took over large areas, creating the so-called "Fatahland".
