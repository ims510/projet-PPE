The Psychology of War
Why do humans find it so difficult to live in peace?

   and Egypt, which arose around 3,000 BC. From that point until the
   present day, history is little more than a catalog of endless wars.
   Between 1740 and 1897, there were 230 wars and revolutions in Europe,
   and during this time countries were almost bankrupting themselves with
   their military expenditure.
   Warfare actually became slightly less frequent during the nineteenth
   and early twentieth centuries, but this was only because of the awesome
   technological power nations could now utilize, which meant that wars
   were over more quickly. In reality, the death toll from wars rose
   sharply. Whereas only 30 million people died in all the wars between
   1740 and 1897, estimates of the number of dead in the First World War
   range from 5 million to 13 million, and a staggering 50 million people
   died during the Second World War. (Since then, deaths from warfare have
   declined significantly, for reasons I will discuss later.)
   Theories of Warfare
   How can we explain this pathological behavior?
   Evolutionary psychologists sometimes suggest that it’s natural for
   human groups to wage war because we’re made up of selfish genes that
   demand to be replicated. So it’s natural for us to try to get hold of
--
   to compete and fight with them.
   There are also biological attempts to explain war. Men are biologically
   primed to fight wars because of the large amount of testosterone they
   contain, since it is widely believed that testosterone is linked to
--
   However, these explanations are highly problematic. For example, they
   cannot explain the apparent lack of warfare in early human history, or
   pre-history, and the relative lack of conflict in most traditional
   hunter-gatherer societies. This is a hotly debated issue, and there are
   some scholars and scientists who claim that warfare has always existed
   in human societies.

   anthropologist R. Brian Ferguson has amassed convincing evidence to
   show that warfare is only around 10,000 years old, and only became
   frequent from around 6,000 years ago.
   And one problem biological theories of warfare is that, while they
   might be able to explain specific outbreaks of violence, warfare is
   actually much more than this. Warfare is a highly planned and organized
   activity, mostly conducted and organized in non-violent situations —

   Psychological Explanations
   The first psychologist to investigate war was William James, who wrote
   the seminal essay "The Moral Equivalent of War" in 1910. Here James
   suggested that warfare was so prevalent because of its positive
   psychological effects, both on the individual and on society as a

   On a social level, war delivers a sense of unity in the face of a
   collective threat. It binds people together—not just the army engaged
   in battle, but the whole community. It brings what James referred to as
   discipline—a sense of cohesion, with communal goals. The "war effort"
   inspires individual citizens (not just soldiers) to behave honorably
   and unselfishly in service of a greater good.
   On an individual level, one of the positive effects of war is that it
   makes people feel more alive, alert, and awake. In James’ words, it

   "Life seems cast upon a higher plane of power." Warfare also enables
   the expression of higher human qualities that often lie dormant in

   One obvious factor is the drive to increase wealth, status, and power.
   A major motivation of warfare is the desire of one group of human
   beings—usually governments, but often the general population of a

   by seizing their territory and resources.
   Pick almost any war in history and you’ll find some variant of these
   causes: wars to annex new territory, to colonize new lands, to take
   control of valuable minerals or oil, to help build an empire to

   blow of losing its favored government in the Ukraine.
   Secondly, war is strongly related to group identity. Human beings, in
   general, have a strong need for belonging and identity which can easily

   The problem with this isn’t so much having pride in our identity, but
   the attitude it engenders towards other groups. Identifying exclusively
   with a particular group automatically creates a sense of rivalry and

   oppress, and even kill them.
   The Decline of Warfare
   The good news is that since the end of the Second World War — as Steven
   Pinker points out in The Better Angels of Our Nature — there has been a
   steady worldwide decline in the number of deaths due to warfare. In
   Europe, countries that had been in an almost constant state of war with
   one or more of their neighbors for centuries — such as France, Germany,
--
   unprecedentedly long period of peace.
   As Pinker points out, the decades after the Second World War — up till
   the 1980s — saw an increase in intrastate violence in the world as a
   whole, due to a large number of civil wars. But since the 1980s,
   intrastate violence has declined too, so that the last 25-30 years have
   been by far the least war-afflicted in recent history, and we've seen a
   correspondingly low number of casualties.

   democracy (making it more difficult for governments to declare war

   is a good example of what William James meant by a moral equivalent of
   war — an activity that satisfies similar psychological needs to war,

   increased interconnection leads to a decline in group identity, and in
   enmity towards other groups. It promotes moral inclusion, an expansion
   of empathy, and makes it less possible for us to perceive different

   Perhaps, then, as a species, we are slowly beginning to transcend the
   pathology of warfare. Hopefully conflicts such as the present one in
   Ukraine will be seen more and more as aberrations, as group identity

   service of their own desires.

   pressure — which unfortunately I don’t have space to discuss here. See
