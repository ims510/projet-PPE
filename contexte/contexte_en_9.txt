   War film is a film genre concerned with warfare, typically about naval,
   air, or land battles, with combat scenes central to the drama.^[1]^[2]
--
   between soldiers, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the
   effects of war on society, and the moral and human issues raised by
   war. The stories told may be fiction, historical drama, or
   biographical.
   Subgenres, not necessarily distinct, include anti-war, comedy,
   propaganda, and documentary. There are similarly subgenres of the war
   film in specific theatres such as the Western Desert of North Africa
   and the Pacific in the Second World War, Vietnam, or the Soviet–Afghan
   War; and films set in specific domains of war, such as the infantry,
   the air, at sea, in submarines or at prisoner of war camps.
Genre[edit]

   The war film genre is not necessarily tightly defined: the American
   Film Institute, for example, speaks of "films to grapple with the Great
--
   and critics have offered at least tentative definitions. The director
   Sam Fuller defined the genre by saying that "a war film's objective, no
   matter how personal or emotional, is to make a viewer feel war."^[4]
   John Belton identified four narrative elements of the war film within
   the context of Hollywood production: a) the suspension of civilian
   morality during times of war, b) primacy of collective goals over
   individual motivations, c) rivalry between men in predominantly male
--
   depiction of the reintegration of veterans.^[5] The fateful nature of
   battle scenes means that war films often end with them.^[6]

   The film critic Stephen Neale suggests that the genre is for the most
   part well defined and uncontentious, since war films are simply those
   about war being waged in the 20th century, with combat scenes central
   to the drama. However, Neale notes, films set in the American Civil War
   or the American Indian Wars of the 19th century were called war films
   in the time before the First World War.^[1] The critic Julian Smith
   argues, on the contrary, that the war film lacks the formal boundaries
   of a genre like the Western, but that in practice, "successful and
   influential" war films are about modern wars, in particular World War
   II, with the combination of mobile forces and mass killing.^[2] The
   film scholar Kathryn Kane^[7] points out some similarities between the
   war film genre and the Western. Both genres use opposing concepts like
   war and peace, civilization and savagery. War films usually frame World
   War II as a conflict between "good" and "evil" as represented by the
--
   peoples.^[8] James Clarke notes the similarity between a Western like
   Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch and "war-movie escapades" like The Dirty
   Dozen.^[9]
   The film historian Jeanine Basinger states that she began with a
   preconception of what the war film genre would be, namely that:
     What I knew in advance was what presumably every member of our
--
   argues that the combat film is not a subgenre but the only genuine kind
   of war film. Since she notes that there were in fact only five true
   combat films made during the Second World War, in her view these few
   films, central to the genre, are outweighed by the many other films
   that are only just war films.^[12] However, other critics such as
   Russell Earl Shain propose a far broader definition of war film, to
   include films that deal "with the roles of civilians, espionage agents,
   and soldiers in any of the aspects of war (i.e. preparation, cause,
   prevention, conduct, daily life, and consequences or aftermath.)"^[13]
   Neale points out that genres overlap, with combat scenes for different
   purposes in other types of film, and suggests that war films are
   characterised by combat which "determines the fate of the principal
   characters". This in turn pushes combat scenes to the climactic ends of
   war films.^[6] Not all critics agree, either, that war films must be
   about 20th-century wars. James Clarke includes Edward Zwick's
   Oscar-winning Glory (1990) among the war films he discusses in detail;
   it is set in the American Civil War, and he lists six other films about
   that war which he considers "notable".^[14]^[a] The screenwriter and
   scholar Eric R. Williams identifies war films as one of eleven
   super-genres in his screenwriters' taxonomy, claiming that all
--
   For example, he calls the 2000 American film U-571 a "shameless
   deception" for pretending that a US warship had helped to win the
   Battle of the Atlantic—seven months before America entered the
   war.^[17] He is equally critical of Christopher Nolan's 2017 film
   Dunkirk with its unhistorically empty beaches, low-level air combat
--
   days in his Berlin bunker,^[17] and he considers the 1965 French film
   The 317th Platoon, set in Vietnam, "the greatest war movie ever made".
   The 1966 film The Battle of Algiers is, he argues, a close second.^[17]

American Civil War[edit]
   The costliest war in U.S. history in terms of American life, this war
   has been the subject of, or the backdrop to, numerous films,
--
   Civil War as its subject was D.W. Griffith's 1910 silent picture, The
   Fugitive.^[18] Films that have the war as its main subject, or about a
   certain aspect of the war, include the 1989 film Glory, about the first
   formal unit of the Union Army during the American Civil War to be made
   up entirely of Black volunteers.^[19] Some films such as Gettysburg
   focused on a single battle during the war,^[20] or even on a single
   incident, like the French short film La Rivière du Hibou (An Occurrence
--
   (1956).^[22] Others like the 1993 miniseries North and South spanned
   the entire breadth of the war. Some films deal with the human aspects
   of the war, such as The Red Badge of Courage (1951),^[23] or Shenandoah
   (1965), on the tragedy that the war inflicted on the civilian
   population.^[24] Ken Burns's The Civil War is the most-watched

   War I
   During the First World War, many films were made about life in the war.
   Topics included prisoners of war, covert operations, and military
   training. Both the Central Powers and the Allies produced war
   documentaries. The films were also used as propaganda in neutral
   countries like the United States. Among these was a film shot on the
   Eastern Front by official war photographer to the Central Powers,

   conduct of the war, as did later films like The Bridges at Toko-Ri

   were anti-war. No Hollywood films about the Korean War did well at the
   box office; the historian Lary May suggested in 2001 that they reminded
   American viewers of "the only war we have lost".^[51]

   The first popular Allied war films made during the Second World War

   Information. The British film industry began to combine documentary
   techniques with fictional stories in films like Noël Coward and David
   Lean's In Which We Serve (1942)—"the most successful British film of
   the war years"^[62]—Millions Like Us (1943), and The Way Ahead

   murdered children and hanged civilians. It won an Academy Award in 1943
   for best documentary.^[71]^[72] Newsreel cameras were similarly rushed
   to Stalingrad early in 1943 to record "the spectacle which greeted the
   Russian soldiers"—the starvation of Russian prisoners of war in the
   Voropovono camp by the German Sixth Army, defeated in the Battle of
   Stalingrad.^[73]

   values.^[79] The historian John Dower found that Japanese wartime films
   had been largely forgotten, as "losers do not get reruns", yet they

   Britain could figure as the "cultural enemy". For Japanese film-makers,
   war was not a cause but more like a natural disaster, and "what
   mattered was not whom one fought but how well". Asian enemies,
   especially the Chinese, were often portrayed as redeemable and even
   possible marriage partners. Japanese wartime films do not glorify war,
   but present the Japanese state as one great family and the Japanese
--
   others."^[81]
  Postwar[edit]

   According to Andrew Pulver of The Guardian, the public fascination with
   war films became an "obsession", with over 200 war films produced in
   each decade of the 1950s and 1960s.^[82] War film production in the
--
   "exclusively British [victory]", it failed in the American market.^[88]
   A large number of war films were made in the 1955–1958 period in
   particular. In 1957 alone, Bitter Victory, Count Five and Die, The
--
   and Seven Thunders, and the highly successful, critically acclaimed
   pictures The Bridge on the River Kwai (which won the Academy Award for
   Best Picture that year^[89]) and Paths of Glory were released.^[90]
   Some, such as Bitter Victory, focused more on the psychological battle
   between officers and egotism rather than events during the war.^[91]
   The Bridge on the River Kwai brought a new complexity to the war
   picture, with a sense of moral uncertainty surrounding war. By the end
   of the decade the "sense of shared achievement" which had been common
   in war films "began to evaporate", according to Pulver.^[82]
   Hollywood films in the 1950s and 1960s could display spectacular
--
   attention to the lives of the men, the more realistic film.^[92] The
   formula for a successful war film consisted, according to Lawrence
   Suid, of a small group of ethnically diverse men; an unreasonable
   senior officer; cowards became heroic, or died.^[92] Jeanine Basinger
   suggests that a traditional war film should have a hero, a group, and
   an objective, and that the group should contain "an Italian, a Jew, a
--
   The Guns of Navarone (1961), The Train (1964), and Where Eagles Dare
   (1968). These used the war as a backdrop for spectacular action.^[82]

   help an audience understand and accept war".^[74] Its success revived
   interest in World War II films.^[103] Others tried to portray the
   reality of the war, as in Joseph Vilsmaier's Stalingrad (1993), which
   The New York Times said "goes about as far as a movie can go in
   depicting modern warfare as a stomach-turning form of mass
   slaughter".^[104]

   Anti-war: Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front, 1930
   The anti-war genre began with films about the First World War. Films in
   the genre are typically revisionist, reflecting on past events and
   often generically blended. Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western
   Front (1930) was unquestionably powerful, and an early anti-war film,
   portraying a German point of view; it was the first film (in any genre)
--
   analysing All Quiet on the Western Front, defined the genre as showing:
   the brutality of war; the amount of human suffering; the betrayal of
   men's trust by incompetent officers. War and anti-war films often prove
   difficult to categorize as they contain many generic ambiguities.^[1]
   While many anti-war films criticize war directly through depictions of
   grisly combat in past wars, some films such as Penn's Alice's
   Restaurant criticized war obliquely by poking fun at such things as the
   draft board.^[162] The number of anti-war films produced in America
   dipped sharply during the 1950s because of McCarthyism and the
--
   introduction of the MPAA rating system marked a time of resurgence for
   films of all type including anti-war films in the States. Robert
   Eberwein names two films as anti-war classics.^[164] The first is Jean
   Renoir's prisoner of war masterpiece^[148] La Grande Illusion (The
   Grand Illusion, 1937). Renoir's critique of contemporary politics and
--
   common experiences should prevail above political division, and its
   extension: war.^[165] The second is Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory
   (1957). The critic David Ehrenstein writes that Paths of Glory
--
   generation" and a world-class talent. Ehrenstein describes the film as
   an "outwardly cool/inwardly passionate protest drama about a disastrous
   French army maneuver and the court-martial held in its wake",
   contrasting it with the "classic" All Quiet on the Western Front's
   story of an innocent "unstrung by the horrors of war".^[166]
  Mixed genres[edit]
   Comedy gave scope for satire, and post-war film-makers merged comedy
   and anti-war sentiment in films as varied as Stalag 17 (1953) and Dr
   Strangelove (1964).^[167] Black comedies like Mike Nichols's Catch-22
--
   about real life General George S. Patton, where combat scenes were
   interleaved with commentary about how he waged war, showing good and
   bad sides to a command. It and MASH became the two most profitable
   war/anti-war films made up to that time,^[169] and Patton won seven
   Academy Awards.^[170]
