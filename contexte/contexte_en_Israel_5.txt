       enough to limit dangerous global warming.

       could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed,
       especially vis-à-vis Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s recent
       announcement to cut oil production? KISSANE: Well, first of all, I’d
--
       doesn’t need oil for larger national security issues. And I think one
       of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or
       think about, is the amount of oil that gets produced every day. So,
--
       most, you know, longstanding analysts and OPEC observers. And again,
       part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of
       Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the
--
       sort of provide some sort of context, and a little bit of, you know,
       that we can discuss in the questions that I really look forward to
       answering from the audience. FASKIANOS: Thank you, Carolyn. That was
--
       emphasize that number, is because a lot of people sort of just aren’t
       aware of how much oil we continue to consume, and again, what the
       demand expectations are moving forward. And these demand expectations
       are, you know, coming out of forecasts from the International Energy
--
       swaths of the world that, you know, are still, and have yet to move
       towards, you know, really reducing—and that are actually going to see
       higher demand moving forward, as their economies grow. FASKIANOS:
       Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Jovana Vujanic,
--
       So, China is a large importer of oil. So, if you go back to World
       War—the end of World War II, that’s when the United States established
       the oil-for-security relationship with Saudi Arabia. And as we have
--
       disruptions. But because, you know, as the administration said, it
       was—you know, it was—it was—it was a war—it was a war-specific
       decision, because the—you know, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was
--
       think Russia, again, has a—has a desire, and also, you know, revenue
       needs—they’re funding a very expensive war—that they’re finding ways
       to get their—to get their oil out. I think an interesting question is,
--
       see it. I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s soon. FASKIANOS:
       Thank you. I’m taking the next question from Rob Warren at the
       Anglo-American University of Prague. This question also got an upvote:
       How do you foresee Venezuela’s role in the global oil market changing
       moving forward? And can it be reintegrated into the global economy?
       KISSANE: Oh, these are all fantastic questions. Thank you all so much.
--
       openness, then I think you could imagine, you know, Venezuela having
       an opportunity, or a pathway forward, to be more integrated into the
       global energy system, and the global oil system. You know, I think one
--
       University. And my question is: You just mentioned about the
       above-ground, you know, effects. And—so the movement towards, like,
       electric vehicles and so on, how do you think it is going to affect
--
       Bales, who is a senior at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois:
       How is the war between Russia and Ukraine having an effect on the
       progress of the European Green Deal? Maybe you can tell us what the
--
       technologies. And so, Europe is investing—you know, I think it’s about
       $250 billion, the United States, it’s about 370 billion—towards
       the—kind of the energy transition, and helping to support domestic
--
       other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy, that includes
       specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate
       change. So you know, I think you’re seeing this kind of—some people
--
       lot of—a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects
       will be moving forward, for various reasons, in terms of making sure
       that the investments are there. Someone I know that studies pipelines,
--
       important source of energy, especially, you know, gas, going
       into—going into Europe, moving forward. FASKIANOS: So, I’ll take the
       next written question from Vincent Brooks, who is at Harvard and
--
       they now have access to. And again, I think, you know, a big question
       is what we’re going to see moving forward around oil demand in China.
       Wood Mackenzie just published a really interesting piece, kind of very
--
       and energy between Europe and Russia, could accelerate energy
       transition toward greener energy? KISSANE: Great question. I think in
       Europe, it is. And I think, you know, many analysts would agree
--
       between Saudi Arabia and the United States. We also have a, you know,
       a hot war, cold war, depending on, you know, the term you want to use,
       between the United States and China, and lots of sort of questions as
--
       are really, really critical. So, I think we have to be very cautious
       moving forward, that we don’t take more out of the system before we
       have adequately set up the system to be resilient, and to be able to
--
       finals. Carolyn Kissane, thank you so much. KISSANE: Thank you. It was
       a pleasure. Great. FASKIANOS: And we look forward to your continued
       participation in this series. KISSANE: Thank you very much. Appreciate
