   World War II (WWII or WW2) or the Second World War was a global
   conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast majority of the
--
   participating countries invested all available economic, industrial,
   and scientific capabilities into this total war, blurring the
   distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a
   major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and
   delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. It was by
   far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in 70–85 million
--
   starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of Axis defeat,
   Germany, Austria, and Japan were occupied, and war crime tribunals were
   conducted against German and Japanese leaders.
   The causes of the war are debated; contributing factors included the
   rise of fascism in Europe, the Spanish Civil War, the Second
   Sino-Japanese War, Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, and tensions in
   the aftermath of World War I. World War II is generally considered to
   have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler,
   invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany
   on 3 September. Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939,
--
   Japan, and other countries. Following the onset of campaigns in North
   and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued
   primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with
   the war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the
   UK, and the Battle of the Atlantic. In June 1941, Germany led the
   European Axis powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the
   Eastern Front, the largest land theatre of war in history.
   Japan aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, and by 1937 was at war
   with the Republic of China. In December 1941, Japan attacked American
--
   Harbor which resulted in the United States and the United Kingdom
   declaring war against Japan. The European Axis powers declared war on
   the US in solidarity. Japan soon conquered much of the western Pacific,
--
   in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and
   captured key western Pacific islands. The war in Europe concluded with
   the liberation of German-occupied territories; the invasion of Germany
--
   Japanese archipelago, the possibility of more atomic bombings, and the
   Soviet Union's declared entry into the war against Japan on the eve of
   invading Manchuria, Japan announced on 10 August its intention to
   surrender, signing a surrender document on 2 September 1945.
   World War II changed the political alignment and social structure of
   the world, and set the foundation for the international order for the
--
   Security Council. The Soviet Union and the US emerged as rival
   superpowers, setting the stage for the Cold War. In the wake of
   European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned,
   triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose
   industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and
   expansion.

   World War II began in Europe on 1 September 1939^[1]^[2] with the
   German invasion of Poland and the United Kingdom and France's
   declaration of war on Germany two days later on 3 September 1939. Dates
   for the beginning of the Pacific War include the start of the Second
   Sino-Japanese War on 7 July 1937,^[3]^[4] or the earlier Japanese
   invasion of Manchuria, on 19 September 1931.^[5]^[6] Others follow the
   British historian A. J. P. Taylor, who stated that the Sino-Japanese
   War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously, and the
   two wars became World War II in 1941.^[7] Other theorized starting
   dates for World War II include the Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3
   October 1935.^[8] The British historian Antony Beevor views the
   beginning of World War II as the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought between
   Japan and the forces of Mongolia and the Soviet Union from May to
   September 1939.^[9] Others view the Spanish Civil War as the start or
   prelude to World War II.^[10]^[11]
   The exact date of the war's end is not universally agreed upon. It was
   generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of
   15 August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than with the formal surrender of
   Japan on 2 September 1945, which officially ended the war in Asia. A
   peace treaty between Japan and the Allies was signed in 1951.^[12] A
   1990 treaty regarding Germany's future allowed the reunification of
   East and West Germany to take place and resolved most post–World War II
   issues.^[13] No formal peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union
   was ever signed,^[14] although the state of war between the two
   countries was terminated by the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of

   World War I had radically altered the political European map with the
   defeat of the Central Powers—including Austria-Hungary, Germany,

   power in Russia, which led to the founding of the Soviet Union.
   Meanwhile, the victorious Allies of World War I, such as France,

   Austria-Hungary, Ottoman and Russian empires.
   To prevent a future world war, the League of Nations was established in
   1920 by the Paris Peace Conference. The organisation's primary goals

   peaceful negotiations and arbitration.^[16]
   Despite strong pacifist sentiment after World War I,^[17] irredentist
   and revanchist nationalism had emerged in several European states.

   and a democratic government, later known as the Weimar Republic, was
   created. The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new
   republic and hardline opponents on both the political right and left.
   Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains;
   however, Italian nationalists were angered that the promises made by
   the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war
   were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the

   The Second Italo-Ethiopian War was a brief colonial war that began in
   October 1935 and ended in May 1936. The war began with the invasion of
   the Ethiopian Empire (also known as Abyssinia) by the armed forces of
   the Kingdom of Italy (Regno d'Italia), which was launched from Italian

   On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland after having staged several
   false flag border incidents as a pretext to initiate the invasion.^[65]
   The first German attack of the war came against the Polish defenses at
   Westerplatte.^[66] The United Kingdom responded with an ultimatum for
   Germany to cease military operations, and on 3 September, after the
   ultimatum was ignored, Britain and France declared war on Germany,^[67]
   followed by Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Canada. During
   the Phoney War period, the alliance provided no direct military support
   to Poland, outside of a cautious French probe into the Saarland.^[68]
   The Western Allies also began a naval blockade of Germany, which aimed
   to damage the country's economy and war effort.^[69] Germany responded
   by ordering U-boat warfare against Allied merchant and warships, which
   would later escalate into the Battle of the Atlantic.^[70]
   On 8 September, German troops reached the suburbs of Warsaw. The Polish
   counter-offensive to the west halted the German advance for several
   days, but it was outflanked and encircled by the Wehrmacht. Remnants of
   the Polish army broke through to besieged Warsaw. On 17 September 1939,
   two days after signing a cease-fire with Japan, the Soviet Union
   invaded Poland^[71] under the supposed pretext that the Polish state
   had ceased to exist.^[72] On 27 September, the Warsaw garrison
   surrendered to the Germans, and the last large operational unit of the

   With the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany,

   Land warfare changed from the static frontlines of trench warfare of
   World War I, which had relied on improved artillery that outmatched the
   speed of both infantry and cavalry, to increased mobility and combined
   arms. The tank, which had been used predominantly for infantry support
   in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon.^[441] In
   the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had
   been during World War I,^[442] and advances continued throughout the
   war with increases in speed, armour and firepower.^[443]^[444] At the

   spread, a notable example being the German MG 34, and various
