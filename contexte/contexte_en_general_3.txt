   In all ages war has been an important topic of analysis. In the latter
   part of the 20th century, in the aftermath of two World Wars and in the
   shadow of nuclear, biological, and chemical holocaust, more was written on
   the subject than ever before. Endeavours to understand the nature of war,
   to formulate some theory of its causes, conduct, and prevention, are of
   great importance, for theory shapes human expectations and determines
   human behaviour. The various schools of theorists are generally aware of

   1815, 19th-century aquatint, after a painting by William Heath.(more)
   Reflecting changes in the international system, theories of war have
   passed through several phases in the course of the past three centuries.
   After the ending of the wars of religion, about the middle of the 17th
   century, wars were fought for the interests of individual sovereigns and
   were limited both in their objectives and in their scope. The art of
   maneuver became decisive, and analysis of war was couched accordingly in
   terms of strategies. The situation changed fundamentally with the outbreak
   of the French Revolution, which increased the size of forces from small
   professional to large conscript armies and broadened the objectives of war
   to the ideals of the revolution, ideals that appealed to the masses who
   were subject to conscription. In the relative order of post-Napoleonic
   Europe, the mainstream of theory returned to the idea of war as a
   rational, limited instrument of national policy. This approach was best
   articulated by the Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz in his
   famous classic On War (1832–37).

   World War I, which was “total” in character because it resulted in the
   mobilization of entire populations and economies for a prolonged period of
   time, did not fit into the Clausewitzian pattern of limited conflict, and
   it led to a renewal of other theories. These no longer regarded war as a
   rational instrument of state policy. The theorists held that war, in its
   modern, total form, if still conceived as a national state instrument,
   should be undertaken only if the most vital interests of the state,
   touching upon its very survival, are concerned. Otherwise, warfare serves
   broad ideologies and not the more narrowly defined interests of a
   sovereign or a nation. Like the religious wars of the 17th century, war
   becomes part of “grand designs,” such as the rising of the proletariat in
   communist eschatology or the Nazi doctrine of a master race.
   Some theoreticians have gone even further, denying war any rational
   character whatsoever. To them war is a calamity and a social disaster,
   whether it is afflicted by one nation upon another or conceived of as
   afflicting humanity as a whole. The idea is not new—in the aftermath of
   the Napoleonic Wars it was articulated, for example, by Tolstoy in the
   concluding chapter of War and Peace (1865–69). In the second half of the
   20th century it gained new currency in peace research, a contemporary form
   of theorizing that combines analysis of the origins of warfare with a
   strong normative element aiming at its prevention. Peace research
   concentrates on two areas: the analysis of the international system and
   the empirical study of the phenomenon of war.

   Upshot-Knothole at the Nevada Test Site, May 25, 1953.(more)
   World War II and the subsequent evolution of weapons of mass destruction
   made the task of understanding the nature of war even more urgent. On the
   one hand, war had become an intractable social phenomenon, the elimination
   of which seemed to be an essential precondition for the survival of
   mankind. On the other hand, the use of war as an instrument of policy was
   calculated in an unprecedented manner by the nuclear superpowers, the
   United States and the Soviet Union. War also remained a stark but rational
   instrumentality in certain more limited conflicts, such as those between
   Israel and the Arab nations. Thinking about war, consequently, became
   increasingly more differentiated because it had to answer questions

   Clausewitz cogently defines war as a rational instrument of foreign
   policy: “an act of violence intended to compel our opponent to fulfill our
   will.” Modern definitions of war, such as “armed conflict between
   political units,” generally disregard the narrow, legalistic definitions
   characteristic of the 19th century, which limited the concept to formally
   declared war between states. Such a definition includes civil wars but at
   the same time excludes such phenomena as insurrections, banditry, or
   piracy. Finally, war is generally understood to embrace only armed
   conflicts on a fairly large scale, usually excluding conflicts in which
