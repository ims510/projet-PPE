   “I don’t think that [the war] is a stalemate,” Ukrainian president
   Volodymyr Zelensky told NBC News’ Meet the Press on Sunday.

   Zelensky’s tensions with his generals reached a peak with Zaluzhny’s
   November 1 interview with The Economist. He asserted that the war had
   reached a “stalemate.” He conceded that “There will most likely be no deep

   What’s worse is that Zaluzhny implied that the stalemate would evolve into
   defeat for Ukraine. A stalemate entails a long war of attrition. In a
   companion essay published simultaneously by The Economist, he explained
   that a long war “as a rule, in most cases, is beneficial to one of the
   parties to the conflict. In our particular case, it is the russian [sic]

   its military power.”
   Zaluzhny said that in a prolonged war, Ukraine will run out of the
   “required volume” of missiles and ammunition while Russia, despite
   sanctions, is increasing its production capabilities. And even if it
   didn’t run out of weapons, he added, it will run out of men: a war of
   attrition “leads to the lack of Ukraine's ability to achieve superiority

   NBC reports that the conversations “began amid concerns among U.S. and
   European officials that the war has reached a stalemate.” NBC reports
   that, like Zaluzhny, “[s]ome U.S. military officials have privately begun

Did Israel kill Iranian commander to provoke a wider war?

   by an Israeli airstrike in a Damascus neighborhood, according to Iran’s
   official news agency IRNA and Britain-based opposition war monitor the
   Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
   This has led Tehran to call for reprisals, ratcheting up fears that this
   might be the match that ignites a wider Middle East war.
   Syria state news did not issue a statement, and Israel has declined to
   comment.
   Israel either killed Mousavi as a warning to Iran — given Tehran’s support
   for the Houthis’ attacks on ships in the Red Sea — or as a provocation to
   beget an Iranian response that would give Israel the pretext to enlarge
   the war, or as a preparatory move to enlarge the war regardless of Iran’s
   response. Either one points to trouble.

   be a warning to Iran that Israel has the capacity and willingness to exact

   engender an Iranian response that would give Israel the pretext to enlarge
   the war. While the Biden administration has given Israel the green light
   to bomb Gaza to smithereens, Biden opposes an expansion of the war since
   that very likely could drag the U.S. into it.
   The debate inside the Israeli government is increasingly leaning toward
   expanding the war. They have already mobilized more than 300,000 troops,
   and there is a growing belief in Israel that it simply is intolerable for

   Israeli argument is that next time it might be Hezbollah, and as a result,
   Israel has no choice but to expand the war. But unless there is an attack
   from Iran or Hezbollah itself, the U.S. may continue to oppose such a

   Israel via Hezbollah, the reasoning goes, and Israel can then use
   Hezbollah’s action as a pretext to not only expand the war to Lebanon —
   but also force the U.S. to go along with it.

   assassination may be a preparatory move to enlarge the war regardless of
   Iran’s response to the killing of Mousavi.

   refuses to pressure Israel to accept a ceasefire in Gaza, tensions in the
   region will continue to rise and the Middle East will gravitate towards a

   As U.S.-China tensions have risen the past few years, several U.S. and
   Taiwanese officials have made alarming warnings that Beijing will launch
   an invasion of the island by 2027 or as early as 2025, potentially
   triggering a disastrous war between the two powers.
