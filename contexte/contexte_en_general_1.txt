   War is an intense armed conflict^[a] between states, governments,
   societies, or paramilitary groups such as mercenaries, insurgents, and
   militias. It is generally characterized by extreme violence, destruction,
   and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. Warfare refers
   to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars
   in general.^[2] Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely
   legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other
   non-combatant suffering and casualties.
   While some war studies scholars consider war a universal and ancestral
   aspect of human nature,^[3] others argue it is a result of specific

Etymology

   The earliest evidence of prehistoric warfare is a Mesolithic cemetery in
   Jebel Sahaba, which has been determined to be about 13,400 years old.^[6]
--
   Since the rise of the state some 5,000 years ago,^[8] military activity
   has occurred over much of the globe. Estimates for total deaths due to war
   vary wildly. For the period 3000 BCE until 1991, estimates range from
   145 million to 2 billion.^[9] In one estimate, primitive warfare prior to
   3000 BCE has been thought to have claimed 400 million victims based on the
--
   diseases in the 20th century.^[11]
   In War Before Civilization, Lawrence H. Keeley, a professor at the
   University of Illinois, says approximately 90–95% of known societies
   throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare,^[12] and many
   fought constantly.^[13]
   Keeley describes several styles of primitive combat such as small raids,
   large raids, and massacres. All of these forms of warfare were used by
   primitive societies, a finding supported by other researchers.^[14] Keeley
   explains that early war raids were not well organized, as the participants
   did not have any formal training. Scarcity of resources meant defensive
--
   a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty.'"^[16]
   The invention of gunpowder, and its eventual use in warfare, together with
   the acceleration of technological advances have fomented major changes to
   war itself.

   In Western Europe, since the late 18th century, more than 150 conflicts
   and about 600 battles have taken place.^[17] During the 20th century, war
   resulted in a dramatic intensification of the pace of social changes, and
   was a crucial catalyst for the growth of left-wing politics.^[18]

   In 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of
   modern warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences and
   costs of the newly developed atom bomb, Albert Einstein famously stated,
   "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War
   IV will be fought with sticks and stones."^[19]
   Mao Zedong urged the socialist camp not to fear nuclear war with the
   United States since, even if "half of mankind died, the other half would

   would become socialist."^[20]
   A distinctive feature of war since 1945 is that combat has largely been a
   matter of civil wars and insurgencies.^[21] The major exceptions were the
   Korean War, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Iran–Iraq War, the Gulf
   War, the Eritrean–Ethiopian War, and the Russo-Ukrainian War.

Types of warfare
   Main article: Types of war
     * Asymmetric warfare is the methods used in conflicts between
       belligerents of drastically different levels of military capability or
       size.^[23]
     * Biological warfare, or germ warfare, is the use of biological
       infectious agents or toxins such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi
--
       pathogens.
     * Chemical warfare involves the use of weaponized chemicals in combat.
       Poison gas as a chemical weapon was principally used during World War
       I, and resulted in over a million estimated casualties, including more
       than 100,000 civilians.^[26]
     * Cold warfare is an intense international rivalry without direct
       military conflict, but with a sustained threat of it, including high

       may involve active conflicts by indirect means, such as economic
       warfare, political warfare, covert operations, espionage,
       cyberwarfare, or proxy wars.
     * Conventional warfare is a form of warfare between states in which
       nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons are not used or see limited
       deployment.
     * Cyberwarfare involves the actions by a nation-state or international
       organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's

       claims against the incumbent regime.
     * Information warfare is the application of destructive force on a large
       scale against information assets and systems, against the computers

     * Nuclear warfare is warfare in which nuclear weapons are the primary,
       or a major, method of achieving capitulation.
     * Total war is warfare by any means possible, disregarding the laws of
       war, placing no limits on legitimate military targets, using weapons
       and tactics resulting in significant civilian casualties, or demanding
       a war effort requiring significant sacrifices by the friendly civilian
       population.
     * Unconventional warfare, the opposite of conventional warfare, is an
       attempt to achieve military victory through acquiescence,

   Entities contemplating going to war and entities considering whether to
   end a war may formulate war aims as an evaluation/propaganda tool. War
   aims may stand as a proxy for national-military resolve.^[28]
  Definition
   Fried defines war aims as "the desired territorial, economic, military or
   other benefits expected following successful conclusion of a war".^[29]
  Classification
   Tangible/intangible aims:
     * Tangible war aims may involve (for example) the acquisition of
       territory (as in the German goal of Lebensraum in the first half of
       the 20th century) or the recognition of economic concessions (as in
       the Anglo-Dutch Wars).
     * Intangible war aims – like the accumulation of credibility or
       reputation^[30] – may have more tangible expression ("conquest
--
   Explicit/implicit aims:
     * Explicit war aims may involve published policy decisions.
     * Implicit war aims^[32] can take the form of minutes of discussion,
       memoranda and instructions.^[33]
   Positive/negative aims:
     * "Positive war aims" cover tangible outcomes.
     * "Negative war aims" forestall or prevent undesired outcomes.^[34]
   War aims can change in the course of conflict and may eventually morph
   into "peace conditions"^[35] – the minimal conditions under which a state
   may cease to wage a particular war.

--
   Throughout the course of human history, the average number of people dying
   from war has fluctuated relatively little, being about 1 to 10 people
   dying per 100,000. However, major wars over shorter periods have resulted
   in much higher casualty rates, with 100–200 casualties per 100,000 over a
   few years. While conventional wisdom holds that casualties have increased
   in recent times due to technological improvements in warfare, this is not
   generally true. For instance, the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) had about
   the same number of casualties per capita as World War I, although it was
   higher during World War II (WWII). That said, overall the number of
   casualties from war has not significantly increased in recent times. Quite
   to the contrary, on a global scale the time since WWII has been unusually

  Largest by death toll
   Main articles: List of wars by death toll, Outline of war § Wars, and
   Casualty recording
   The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths
   since its start, is World War II, from 1939 to 1945, with 70–85 million
   deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests^[39] at up to 60 million. As
   concerns a belligerent's losses in proportion to its prewar population,
   the most destructive war in modern history may have been the Paraguayan
   War (see Paraguayan War casualties). In 2013 war resulted in 31,000
   deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990.^[40] War usually results in
   significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease
   in social spending, famine, large-scale emigration from the war zone, and
   often the mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilians.^[41]^[42]^[43]
   For instance, of the nine million people who were on the territory of the
   Byelorussian SSR in 1941, some 1.6 million were killed by the Germans in
   actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war,
   500,000 Jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority
   of whom were unarmed civilians).^[44] Another byproduct of some wars is
   the prevalence of propaganda by some or all parties in the conflict,^[45]
   and increased revenues by weapons manufacturers.^[46]
   Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been
   waged in the last century. These are the two World Wars, followed by the
   Second Sino-Japanese War (which is sometimes considered part of World War
   II, or as overlapping). Most of the others involved China or neighboring
   peoples. The death toll of World War II, being over 60 million, surpasses
   all other war-death-tolls.^[47]

   Military personnel subject to combat in war often suffer mental and

   Additionally, it has been estimated anywhere from 18% to 54% of Vietnam
   war veterans suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder.^[60]
   Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white American males aged 13 to 43
   died in the American Civil War, including about 6% in the North and
   approximately 18% in the South.^[61] The war remains the deadliest
   conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000 military
   personnel. United States military casualties of war since 1775 have
   totaled over two million. Of the 60 million European military personnel
   who were mobilized in World War I, 8 million were killed, 7 million were
   permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured.^[62]

  On civilians

   [IMG]Les Grandes Misères de la guerre depict the destruction unleashed on

   Most wars have resulted in significant loss of life, along with
   destruction of infrastructure and resources (which may lead to famine,
   disease, and death in the civilian population). During the Thirty Years'
   War in Europe, the population of the Holy Roman Empire was reduced by 15
   to 40 percent.^[67]^[68] Civilians in war zones may also be subject to war
   atrocities such as genocide, while survivors may suffer the psychological
   aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war. War also results in
   lower quality of life and worse health outcomes. A medium-sized conflict

   Typically, war becomes intertwined with the economy and many wars are
   partially or entirely based on economic reasons. Following World War II,
   consensus opinion for many years amongst economists and historians was
   that war can stimulate a country's economy as evidenced by the U.S's
   emergence from the Great Depression,^[74] though modern economic analysis
   has thrown significant doubt on these views. In most cases, such as the
   wars of Louis XIV, the Franco-Prussian War, and World War I, warfare
   primarily results in damage to the economy of the countries involved. For
   example, Russia's involvement in World War I took such a toll on the
   Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the
   start of the Russian Revolution of 1917.^[75]
    World War II

   World War II was the most financially costly conflict in history; its
   belligerents cumulatively spent about a trillion U.S. dollars on the war
   effort (as adjusted to 1940 prices).^[76]^[77] The Great Depression of the
   1930s ended as nations increased their production of war materials.^[78]

   There are many theories about the motivations for war, but no consensus
   about which are most common.^[81] Military theorist Carl von Clausewitz
   said, "Every age has its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and
   its own peculiar preconceptions."^[82]
  Psychoanalytic
   Dutch psychoanalyst Joost Meerloo held that, "War is often...a mass
   discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of
--
   ideologies. By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local
   society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare.
   The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of Melanie Klein,
   thought war was the paranoid or projective "elaboration" of mourning.^[85]
   Fornari thought war and violence develop out of our "love need": our wish
   to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely
   our early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the
   sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as
   the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for
   their country, to give over their bodies to their nation.
   Despite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for self-sacrifice
   for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, few wars have
   originated from a desire for war among the general populace.^[86] Far more
   often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its
   rulers. One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by
   Maurice Walsh.^[87] He argues the general populace is more neutral towards
   war and wars occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard
   for human life are placed into power. War is caused by leaders who seek
   war such as Napoleon and Hitler. Such leaders most often come to power in
   times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then
   leads the nation to war.
     Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in
     England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is

   (Luzerner Schilling)
   Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are
   two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging in or after the
   Mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater
   population density and competition over resources; the other sees human
   warfare as a more ancient practice derived from common animal tendencies,
   such as territoriality and sexual competition.^[89]
   The latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found in
   many primate species such as chimpanzees,^[90] as well as in many ant
   species,^[91] group conflict may be a general feature of animal social

   War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive
   international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for
   natural resources and for wealth. War has also been linked to economic
   development by economic historians and development economists studying

   Main article: Marxist explanations of warfare
   The Marxist theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states all modern
   wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great
   (imperialist) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of
   capitalism. Marxist economists Karl Kautsky, Rosa Luxemburg, Rudolf

   This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the

   populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or

   Geoffrey Parker argues that what distinguishes the "Western way of war"
   based in Western Europe chiefly allows historians to explain its
   extraordinary success in conquering most of the world after 1500:
     The Western way of war rests upon five principal foundations:
     technology, discipline, a highly aggressive military tradition, a
     remarkable capacity to innovate and to respond rapidly to the innovation
     of others and – from about 1500 onward – a unique system of war finance.
     The combination of all five provided a formula for military
     success....The outcome of wars has been determined less by technology,
     then by better war plans, the achievement of surprise, greater economic
     strength, and above all superior discipline.^[117]

   Rationalism is an international relations theory or framework. Rationalism

   that states or international actors are rational, seek the best possible
   outcomes for themselves, and desire to avoid the costs of war.^[119] Under
   one game theory approach, rationalist theories posit all actors can
   bargain, would be better off if war did not occur, and likewise seek to
   understand why war nonetheless reoccurs. Under another rationalist game
   theory without bargaining, the peace war game, optimal strategies can
   still be found that depend upon number of iterations played. In
   "Rationalist Explanations for War", James Fearon examined three
   rationalist explanations for why some countries engage in war:
     * Issue indivisibilities

     * Commitment problems^[119]
   "Issue indivisibility" occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by
   bargaining, because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be

   countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not
   agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of
   state's victory or loss. For instance, Geoffrey Blainey argues that war is
   a result of miscalculation of strength. He cites historical examples of
   war and demonstrates, "war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic crisis
   which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting estimates of

   Within the rationalist tradition, some theorists have suggested that
   individuals engaged in war suffer a normal level of cognitive bias,^[122]
   but are still "as rational as you and me".^[123] According to philosopher

   The rationalist theory focused around bargaining is currently under
   debate. The Iraq War proved to be an anomaly that undercuts the validity
   of applying rationalist theory to some wars.^[126]
  Political science
   The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by Lewis Fry Richardson
   following World War I. More recent databases of wars and armed conflict
   have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project, Peter Brecke and the
   Uppsala Conflict Data Program.^[127]
   The following subsections consider causes of war from system, societal,
   and individual levels of analysis. This kind of division was first
   proposed by Kenneth Waltz in Man, the State, and War and has been often
   used by political scientists since then.^[128]^: 143 
--
    1. Balance of power theory: States have the goal of preventing a single
       state from becoming a hegemon, and war is the result of the would-be
       hegemon's persistent attempts at power acquisition. In this view, an
       international system with more equal distribution of power is more
       stable, and "movements toward unipolarity are
       destabilizing."^[128]^: 147  However, evidence has shown power
       polarity is not actually a major factor in the occurrence of
       wars.^[128]^: 147–48 
    2. Power transition theory: Hegemons impose stabilizing conditions on the
       world order, but they eventually decline, and war occurs when a
       declining hegemon is challenged by another rising power or aims to
       preemptively suppress them.^[128]^: 148  On this view, unlike for
       balance-of-power theory, wars become more probable when power is more

   The morality of war has been the subject of debate for thousands of
   years.^[131]
   The two principal aspects of ethics in war, according to the just war
   theory, are jus ad bellum and jus in bello.^[132]
   Jus ad bellum (right to war), dictates which unfriendly acts and
   circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another
   nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war:
   first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it
   must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit
--
   fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success;
   fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought
   must be proportional to means being used.^[133]^[134]
--
   driven out by starvation. These intentions were part of the 'General Plan
   East'." – The Oxford Companion to World War II.^[135]
   Jus in bello (right in war), is the set of ethical rules when conducting
   war. The two main principles are proportionality and discrimination.
   Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally
--
   principle of discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a
   war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is
   permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not.^[136] Failure to
   follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the
   just-war-belligerent.^[137]
   The just war theory was foundational in the creation of the United Nations
   and in international law's regulations on legitimate war.^[131]

Limiting and stopping
   [IMG]Anti-war rally in Washington, D.C., 15 March 2003

   the Second Vatican Council document Gaudiem et Spes: "Any act of war aimed
   indiscriminately at the destruction of entire cities of extensive areas

   merits unequivocal and unhesitating condemnation."^[139]
   Anti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century,
   including, most prominently, World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam
   War. In the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred in
   response to the United States invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. Protests
   opposing the War in Afghanistan occurred in Europe, Asia, and the United
   States.
