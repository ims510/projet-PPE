   Psychological warfare (PSYWAR), or the basic aspects of modern
   psychological operations (PsyOp), have been known by many other names or
   terms, including Military Information Support Operations (MISO), Psy Ops,
   political warfare, "Hearts and Minds", and propaganda.^[1] The term is
   used "to denote any action which is practiced mainly by psychological
--
   Empire.
   Since prehistoric times, warlords and chiefs have recognized the
   importance of weakening the morale of their opponents. In the Battle of
--
   Currying favor with supporters was the other side of psychological
   warfare, and an early practitioner of this was Alexander the Great, who
   successfully conquered large parts of Europe and the Middle East and held
--
   as a result.
   During the Granada War, Spanish captain Hernán Pérez del Pulgar routinely
   employed psychological tactics as part of his guerrilla actions against
--
   disinformation to his opponents, similar to the Operations Fortitude and
   Titanic in World War II.
  World War I[edit]
   [IMG]Lord Bryce led the commission of 1915 to document German atrocities
   committed against Belgian civilians.
   The start of modern psychological operations in war is generally dated to
   World War I. By that point, Western societies were increasingly educated
   and urbanized, and mass media was available in the form of large
--
   explosive delivery systems like modified artillery or mortar rounds.^[13]
   At the start of the war, the belligerents, especially the British and
   Germans, began distributing propaganda, both domestically and on the
--
   communications cable system then in operation. These capabilities were
   easily transitioned to the task of warfare.
   The British also had a diplomatic service that maintained good relations
--
   Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling and H. G. Wells. Over 1,160 pamphlets were
   published during the war and distributed to neutral countries, and
   eventually, to Germany. One of the first significant publications, the
--
   Aerial leaflets were dropped over German trenches containing postcards
   from prisoners of war detailing their humane conditions, surrender notices
   and general propaganda against the Kaiser and the German generals. By the
   end of the war, MI7b had distributed almost 26 million leaflets. The
   Germans began shooting the leaflet-dropping pilots, prompting the British
--
   Belgium.^[16]
   At the start of the war, the French government took control of the media
   to suppress negative coverage. Only in 1916, with the establishment of the
   Maison de la Presse, did they begin to use similar tactics for the purpose
   of psychological warfare. One of its sections was the "Service de la
   Propagande aérienne" (Aerial Propaganda Service), headed by Professor
--
   The Central Powers were slow to use these techniques; however, at the
   start of the war the Germans succeeded in inducing the Sultan of the
   Ottoman Empire to declare 'holy war', or Jihad, against the Western
   infidels. They also attempted to foment rebellion against the British
--
   overthrow of the Tsar. This soon paid off when the Bolshevik Revolution
   took Russia out of the war.^[17]
  World War II[edit]
   Adolf Hitler was greatly influenced by the psychological tactics of
   warfare the British had employed during World War I, and attributed the
   defeat of Germany to the effects this propaganda had on the soldiers. He
--
   Germany's Fall Grün plan of invasion of Czechoslovakia had a large part
   dealing with psychological warfare aimed both at the Czechoslovak
   civilians and government as well as, crucially, at Czechoslovakia's
--
   of UK and France through appeasement to occupy Czechoslovakia without
   having to fight an all-out war, sustaining only minimum losses in covert
   war before the Munich Agreement.
   At the start of the Second World War, the British set up the Political
   Warfare Executive to produce and distribute propaganda. Through the use of
   powerful transmitters, broadcasts could be made across Europe. Sefton
--
   made use of radio broadcasts for propaganda against the Germans. Churchill
   favoured deception; he said "In wartime, truth is so precious that she
   should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.".^[19]
--
   Bodyguard.
   During World War II, the British made extensive use of deception –
   developing many new techniques and theories. The main protagonists at this
--
   deception and double agents helped define Allied deception strategy during
   the war, for which he has been referred to as "the greatest British
   deceiver of WW2".^[22]
   During the lead-up to the Allied invasion of Normandy, many new tactics in
   psychological warfare were devised. The plan for Operation Bodyguard set
   out a general strategy to mislead German high command as to the date and
--
   ground for invasion and "leaked" misinformation about the Allied order of
   battle and war plans.
   Elaborate naval deceptions (Operations Glimmer, Taxable and Big Drum) were
--
   traffic and visual deception. The British "Double Cross" anti-espionage
   operation had proven very successful from the outset of the war,^[25] and
   the LCS was able to use double agents to send back misleading information
   about Allied invasion plans.^[26] The use of visual deception, including
   mock tanks and other military hardware had been developed during the North
   Africa campaign. Mock hardware was created for Bodyguard; in particular,
   dummy landing craft were stockpiled to give the impression that the
--
   The Operation was a strategic success and the Normandy landings caught
   German defences unawares. Continuing deception, portraying the landings as
   a diversion from a forthcoming main invasion in the Calais region, led
--
   battleground for nearly seven weeks.^[27]
  Vietnam War[edit]
   [IMG]"Viet Cong, beware!" – South Vietnam leaflets urging the defection of
   Viet Cong.
   The United States ran an extensive program of psychological warfare during
   the Vietnam War. The Phoenix Program had the dual aim of assassinating
   National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (NLF or Viet Cong) personnel
--
   back for revenge.
   The Vietcong and their forces also used a program of psychological warfare
   during this war. Trịnh Thị Ngọ([ṯɕïŋ˧ˀ˨ʔ tʰi˧ˀ˨ʔ ŋɔ˧ˀ˨ʔ]; 1931 – 30
   September 2016), also known as Thu Hương and Hanoi Hannah, was a
   Vietnamese radio personality. She made English-language broadcasts for
   North Vietnam directed at United States troops. During the Vietnam War,
   Ngọ became famous among US soldiers for her propaganda broadcasts on Radio
--
   made three broadcasts a day, reading a list of newly killed or imprisoned
   Americans, and playing popular US anti-war songs in an effort to incite
   feelings of nostalgia and homesickness, attempting to persuade US GIs that
   the US involvement in the Vietnam War was unjust and immoral.^[29] A
   typical broadcast began as follows:
     How are you, GI Joe? It seems to me that most of you are poorly informed
     about the going of the war, to say nothing about a correct explanation
     of your presence over here. Nothing is more confused than to be ordered
     into a war to die or to be maimed for life without the faintest idea of
     what's going on.^[30]

         (February 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) 
   Most modern uses of the term psychological warfare refer to the following
   military methods:
--
          * Projecting repetitive and disturbing noises and music for long
            periods at high volume towards groups under siege like during
            Operation Nifty Package.
     * Propaganda radio stations, such as Lord Haw-Haw in World War II on the
       "Germany calling" station.

       War.
     * False flag events.
--
     * The threat of chemical weapons.^[41]
     * Information warfare.
   Most of these techniques were developed during World War II or earlier,
   and have been used to some degree in every conflict since. Daniel Lerner

   victory was imminent. Measuring the success or failure of psychological
   warfare is very hard, as the conditions are very far from being a
   controlled experiment.
   Lerner also divides psychological warfare operations into three
   categories:^[42]^[page needed]

   and discredits the source. He writes, "This is one of the few dogmas
   advanced by Sykewarriors that is likely to endure as an axiom of
   propaganda: Credibility is a condition of persuasion. Before you can make
   a man do as you say, you must make him believe what you say."^[42]^: 28 
   Consistent with this idea, the Allied strategy in World War II was
   predominantly one of truth (with certain exceptions).^[citation needed]
   In Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes, Jacques Ellul discusses
   psychological warfare as a common peace policy practice between nations as
   a form of indirect aggression. This type of propaganda drains the public
--
   important element of the People's Republic of China's military
   strategy.^[45]^[46]^[47] This type of warfare is rooted in the Chinese
   Stratagems outlined by Sun Tzu in The Art of War and Thirty-Six
   Stratagems. In its dealings with its rivals, China is expected to utilize

   media to keep a tight hold on propaganda efforts for its people.^[47] The

   The term psychological warfare is believed to have migrated from Germany
   to the United States in 1941.^[65] During World War II, the United States
   Joint Chiefs of Staff defined psychological warfare broadly, stating
   "Psychological warfare employs any weapon to influence the mind of the
   enemy. The weapons are psychological only in the effect they produce and
   not because of the weapons themselves."^[66] The U.S. Department of
   Defense currently defines psychological warfare as:
     "The planned use of propaganda and other psychological actions having

   information-related capabilities."^[70]
