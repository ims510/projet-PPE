   War film is a film genre concerned with warfare, typically about naval,
   air, or land battles, with combat scenes central to the drama.^[1]^[2]
--
   soldiers, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the effects of
   war on society, and the moral and human issues raised by war. The stories
   told may be fiction, historical drama, or biographical.
   Subgenres, not necessarily distinct, include anti-war, comedy, propaganda,
   and documentary. There are similarly subgenres of the war film in specific
   theatres such as the Western Desert of North Africa and the Pacific in the
   Second World War, Vietnam, or the Soviet–Afghan War; and films set in
   specific domains of war, such as the infantry, the air, at sea, in
   submarines or at prisoner of war camps.
Genre[edit]
   Further information: List of war films
   The war film genre is not necessarily tightly defined: the American Film
   Institute, for example, speaks of "films to grapple with the Great War"
   without attempting to classify these.^[3] However, some directors and
   critics have offered at least tentative definitions. The director Sam
   Fuller defined the genre by saying that "a war film's objective, no matter
   how personal or emotional, is to make a viewer feel war."^[4] John Belton
   identified four narrative elements of the war film within the context of
   Hollywood production: a) the suspension of civilian morality during times
   of war, b) primacy of collective goals over individual motivations, c)
   rivalry between men in predominantly male groups as well as
--
   reintegration of veterans.^[5] The fateful nature of battle scenes means
   that war films often end with them.^[6]
   [IMG]John Wayne in The Longest Day, 1962
   The film critic Stephen Neale suggests that the genre is for the most part
   well defined and uncontentious, since war films are simply those about war
   being waged in the 20th century, with combat scenes central to the drama.
   However, Neale notes, films set in the American Civil War or the American
   Indian Wars of the 19th century were called war films in the time before
   the First World War.^[1] The critic Julian Smith argues, on the contrary,
   that the war film lacks the formal boundaries of a genre like the Western,
   but that in practice, "successful and influential" war films are about
   modern wars, in particular World War II, with the combination of mobile
   forces and mass killing.^[2] The film scholar Kathryn Kane^[7] points out
   some similarities between the war film genre and the Western. Both genres
   use opposing concepts like war and peace, civilization and savagery. War
   films usually frame World War II as a conflict between "good" and "evil"
   as represented by the Allied forces and Nazi Germany whereas the Western
--
   peoples.^[8] James Clarke notes the similarity between a Western like Sam
   Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch and "war-movie escapades" like The Dirty
   Dozen.^[9]
   The film historian Jeanine Basinger states that she began with a
   preconception of what the war film genre would be, namely that:
     What I knew in advance was what presumably every member of our culture
     would know about World War II combat films—that they contained a hero, a
     group of mixed types [of people], and a military objective of some sort.
     They take place in the actual combat zones of World War II, against the
     established enemies, on the ground, the sea, or in the air. They contain
--
   Further, Basinger considers Bataan to provide a definition-by-example of
   "the World War II combat film", in which a diverse and apparently unsuited
   group of "hastily assembled volunteers" hold off a much larger group of
   the enemy through their "bravery and tenacity".^[11] She argues that the
   combat film is not a subgenre but the only genuine kind of war film. Since
   she notes that there were in fact only five true combat films made during
   the Second World War, in her view these few films, central to the genre,
   are outweighed by the many other films that are only just war films.^[12]
   However, other critics such as Russell Earl Shain propose a far broader
   definition of war film, to include films that deal "with the roles of
   civilians, espionage agents, and soldiers in any of the aspects of war
   (i.e. preparation, cause, prevention, conduct, daily life, and
--
   with combat scenes for different purposes in other types of film, and
   suggests that war films are characterised by combat which "determines the
   fate of the principal characters". This in turn pushes combat scenes to
   the climactic ends of war films.^[6] Not all critics agree, either, that
   war films must be about 20th-century wars. James Clarke includes Edward
   Zwick's Oscar-winning Glory (1990) among the war films he discusses in
   detail; it is set in the American Civil War, and he lists six other films
   about that war which he considers "notable".^[14]^[a] The screenwriter and
   scholar Eric R. Williams identifies war films as one of eleven
   super-genres in his screenwriters' taxonomy, claiming that all
--
   he calls the 2000 American film U-571 a "shameless deception" for
   pretending that a US warship had helped to win the Battle of the
   Atlantic—seven months before America entered the war.^[17] He is equally
   critical of Christopher Nolan's 2017 film Dunkirk with its unhistorically
--
   Hitler's final days in his Berlin bunker,^[17] and he considers the 1965
   French film The 317th Platoon, set in Vietnam, "the greatest war movie
   ever made". The 1966 film The Battle of Algiers is, he argues, a close

History[edit]
  American Civil War[edit]
   The costliest war in U.S. history in terms of American life, this war has
   been the subject of, or the backdrop to, numerous films, documentaries and
   mini-series. One of the earliest films using the Civil War as its subject
   was D.W. Griffith's 1910 silent picture, The Fugitive.^[18] Films that
   have the war as its main subject, or about a certain aspect of the war,
   include the 1989 film Glory, about the first formal unit of the Union Army
   during the American Civil War to be made up entirely of Black
   volunteers.^[19] Some films such as Gettysburg focused on a single battle
   during the war,^[20] or even on a single incident, like the French short
   film La Rivière du Hibou (An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge)^[21] and
   Disney's The Great Locomotive Chase (1956).^[22] Others like the 1993
   miniseries North and South spanned the entire breadth of the war. Some
   films deal with the human aspects of the war, such as The Red Badge of
   Courage (1951),^[23] or Shenandoah (1965), on the tragedy that the war
   inflicted on the civilian population.^[24] Ken Burns's The Civil War is
   the most-watched documentary in the history of PBS.^[25]

   During the First World War, many films were made about life in the war.
   Topics included prisoners of war, covert operations, and military
   training. Both the Central Powers and the Allies produced war
   documentaries. The films were also used as propaganda in neutral countries
   like the United States. Among these was a film shot on the Eastern Front
   by official war photographer to the Central Powers, Albert K. Dawson: The
   Battle and Fall of Przemysl (1915), depicting the Siege of Przemyśl,

   The 1925 American film The Big Parade depicted unglamorous elements of
   war: the protagonist loses his leg, and his friends are killed.^[32]
   William A. Wellman's Wings (1927) showed aerial combat during the war and
   was made in cooperation with the Army Air Corps. It proved a powerful
   recruiting tool.^[33] It became the first film (in any genre) to be
   awarded an Oscar for best picture.^[34] Later films of varied genres that
   deal with the First World War include David Lean's "colossal epic", both
   war film and biopic^[35] Lawrence of Arabia (1962), shot in the then
   unfamiliar and exciting 70mm Technicolor,^[36] and described by Steven
   Spielberg as "maybe the greatest screenplay ever written for the
   motion-picture medium";^[35] Richard Attenborough's satirical anti-war
   musical comedy based on Joan Littlewood's play of the same name, Oh! What

   Samuel Fuller's The Steel Helmet (1951) was made during the Korean War
   (1950–1953). The critic Guy Westwell notes that it questioned the conduct
   of the war, as did later films like The Bridges at Toko-Ri (1954) and Pork
   Chop Hill (1959).^[50] Fuller agreed that all his films were anti-war. No
   Hollywood films about the Korean War did well at the box office; the
   historian Lary May suggested in 2001 that they reminded American viewers
   of "the only war we have lost".^[51]

  Algerian War[edit]
   Gillo Pontecorvo's dramatic The Battle of Algiers ((Italian: La battaglia
   di Algeri; Arabic: معركة الجزائر; French: La Bataille d'Alger), 1966)
   portrayed events in the Algerian War (1954–1956). It was shot on location
   as an Italo-Algerian co-production. It had the black and white newsreel
   style of Italian neorealism, and even-handedly depicts violence on both
   sides. It won various awards including Golden Lion at the Venice Film
   Festival.^[54] It was attacked by French critics and was for five years
   banned in France as well as Jamila, the Algerian (1958).^[55]
  Vietnam War[edit]
   Further information: Vietnam War in film
   Few films before the late 1970s about the Vietnam War actually depicted
   combat;^[56] exceptions include The Green Berets (1968).^[56] Critics such
   as Basinger explain that Hollywood avoided the subject because of
   opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, making the
   subject divisive; in addition, the film industry was in crisis, and the
   army did not wish to assist in making anti-war films.^[56]^[57]
   From the late 1970s, independently financed and produced films showed
   Hollywood that Vietnam could be treated in film. Successful but very
   different portrayals of the war in which America had been defeated
   included Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter (1978), and Francis Ford
--
   subjective-camera-eye-view" of life under helicopter fire in the Mekong
   Delta during the Vietnam War. The film cuts to an (American)
   "helicopter-eye view", contrasting painfully with the human tenderness
   seen earlier.^[58]
  Later wars[edit]
   Dino Mustafić's Remake (2003), written by Zlatko Topčić, tells the
   parallel coming-of-age stories of a father living in Sarajevo during World
   War II and his son living through the Siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian
   War. According to Topčić, the story is based on incidents from his own
   life.^[59]^[60]
   The Iraq War served as the background story of U.S. movies, like The Hurt
   Locker from 2008, Green Zone from 2010,^[61] and American Sniper from
   2014.
   The War in Afghanistan since 2001 was depicted in various movies, among
   them Restrepo in 2010 and Lone Survivor from 2013.^[61]

   Further information: List of Allied propaganda films of World War II
   The first popular Allied war films made during the Second World War came
   from Britain and combined the functions of documentary and propaganda.
--
   British film industry began to combine documentary techniques with
   fictional stories in films like Noël Coward and David Lean's In Which We
   Serve (1942)—"the most successful British film of the war
   years"^[62]—Millions Like Us (1943), and The Way Ahead (1944).^[63]
--
   In America, documentaries were produced in various ways: General Marshall
   commissioned the Why We Fight propaganda series from Frank Capra; the War
   Department's Information-Education Division started out making training
--
   fighters,^[66] and The North Star (1943) showed the Soviet Union and its
   Communist Party.^[67] Towards the end of the war popular books provided
   higher quality and more serious stories for films such as Guadalcanal
--
   Germans surrendering and dead, and atrocities including murdered children
   and hanged civilians. It won an Academy Award in 1943 for best
   documentary.^[71]^[72] Newsreel cameras were similarly rushed to
   Stalingrad early in 1943 to record "the spectacle which greeted the
   Russian soldiers"—the starvation of Russian prisoners of war in the
   Voropovono camp by the German Sixth Army, defeated in the Battle of
   Stalingrad.^[73]
   Feature films made in the west during the war were subject to censorship
   and were not always realistic in nature. One of the first to attempt to

   does not fall off. Basinger points out that while this is physically
   unrealistic, psychologically it may not have been. The wartime audience
   was, she points out, well aware of friends and relatives who had been
   killed or who had come home wounded.^[74]

   extras and 100 railway wagonloads of salt to simulate snow, it was the
   most costly German film made during the war. The actual siege ended with
   the surrender of the town; in the film, the French generals abandon the
   siege.^[77]
   For Japan, the war began with the undeclared war and invasion of China in
   1937, which the Japanese authorities called "The China Incident". The
--
   even enemy Chinese soldiers are presented as individuals, sometimes
   fighting bravely.^[78] Once war with the United States was declared, the
   Japanese conflict became known as the Pacific War. Japanese film critics
   worried that even with Western film techniques, their film output failed
   to represent native Japanese values.^[79] The historian John Dower found
   that Japanese wartime films had been largely forgotten, as "losers do not
   get reruns", yet they were so subtle and skilful that Frank Capra thought
--
   though Great Britain could figure as the "cultural enemy". For Japanese
   film-makers, war was not a cause but more like a natural disaster, and
   "what mattered was not whom one fought but how well". Asian enemies,
   especially the Chinese, were often portrayed as redeemable and even
   possible marriage partners. Japanese wartime films do not glorify war, but
   present the Japanese state as one great family and the Japanese people as
--
   that, at every level, the Japanese also victimized others."^[81]

   According to Andrew Pulver of The Guardian, the public fascination with

   Got Away, and Seven Thunders, and the highly successful, critically
   acclaimed pictures The Bridge on the River Kwai (which won the Academy
   Award for Best Picture that year^[89]) and Paths of Glory were
   released.^[90] Some, such as Bitter Victory, focused more on the
   psychological battle between officers and egotism rather than events
   during the war.^[91] The Bridge on the River Kwai brought a new complexity
   to the war picture, with a sense of moral uncertainty surrounding war. By
   the end of the decade the "sense of shared achievement" which had been
   common in war films "began to evaporate", according to Pulver.^[82]

   successful war film consisted, according to Lawrence Suid, of a small
   group of ethnically diverse men; an unreasonable senior officer; cowards
   became heroic, or died.^[92] Jeanine Basinger suggests that a traditional
   war film should have a hero, a group, and an objective, and that the group
   should contain "an Italian, a Jew, a cynical complainer from Brooklyn, a

   films.^[103] Others tried to portray the reality of the war, as in Joseph
   Vilsmaier's Stalingrad (1993), which The New York Times said "goes about
   as far as a movie can go in depicting modern warfare as a stomach-turning
   form of mass slaughter".^[104]

  Chinese[edit]
   The first Chinese war films were newsreels like Battle of Wuhan (1911) and
   Battle of Shanghai (1913). Still in films such as Xu Xinfu's Battle
   Exploits (1925), war featured mainly as background. Only with the Second
   Sino–Japanese War from 1937 onwards did war film become a serious genre in
   China, with nationalistic films such as Shi Dongshan's Protect Our Land
   (1938). The Chinese Civil War, too, attracted films such as Cheng Yin's

   War has been the Soviet Union's cinema's major genre, becoming known
   indeed as the "cinema front", and its war films ranged from grim
   portrayals of atrocities to sentimental and even quietly subversive
   accounts.^[115] Leonid Lukov's popular and "beautiful"^[116] Two Warriors

   extrovert southerner from Odessa, singing in his dugout.^[117]
   The many Soviet films about the Second World War include both large-scale
   epics such as Yury Ozerov's Battle of Moscow (1985) and Mikhail
   Kalatozov's more psychological The Cranes are Flying (1957) on the cruel
   effects of war; it won the 1958 Palme d'Or at Cannes.^[118]

   Guy Hamilton's The Colditz Story (1955) and John Sturges's American film
   The Great Escape (1963).^[144] They told stories of real escapes from
   German prisoner of war camps such as Stalag Luft III in the Second World
   War. Despite episodes of danger and human tragedy, these films delight in
   a continual boyish game of escape and ingenuity, celebrating the courage
   and the defiant spirit of the prisoners of war, and treating war as
   fun.^[144]^[145]^[146] David Lean's Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) was

  Animated[edit]
--
   Winsor McCay's The Sinking of the Lusitania (1918) was a silent First
   World War film. At 12 minutes long, it was the longest animated film made
   at that time. It was probably the first animated propaganda film to be
   made; it remains the earliest serious animated drama that has
   survived.^[153]^[154]^[155] Through World War II, animated propaganda
   shorts remained influential in American cinema. The Walt Disney Company,
   working with the American armed forces, produced 400,000 feet of war
   propaganda films between 1942 and 1945,^[156] including Der Fuehrer's Face
   (1943) and Education for Death (1943).^[157]
   Japanese anime films from the 1960s onwards addressed national memories of
   war. Akira (1988) moves from the atomic destruction of Hiroshima and
   Nagasaki to apocalyptic visions of global conflict; Grave of the Fireflies
   (1988) is elegiac on the effect of war on children.^[158]^[159] Barefoot

  Anti-war[edit]
   Further information: List of anti-war films
   [IMG]Anti-war: Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front, 1930
   The anti-war genre began with films about the First World War. Films in
   the genre are typically revisionist, reflecting on past events and often
   generically blended. Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front
   (1930) was unquestionably powerful, and an early anti-war film, portraying
   a German point of view; it was the first film (in any genre) to win two
--
   Quiet on the Western Front, defined the genre as showing: the brutality of
   war; the amount of human suffering; the betrayal of men's trust by
   incompetent officers. War and anti-war films often prove difficult to
   categorize as they contain many generic ambiguities.^[1] While many
   anti-war films criticize war directly through depictions of grisly combat
   in past wars, some films such as Penn's Alice's Restaurant criticized war
   obliquely by poking fun at such things as the draft board.^[162] The
   number of anti-war films produced in America dipped sharply during the
   1950s because of McCarthyism and the Hollywood blacklist.^[163] The end of
   the blacklist and the introduction of the MPAA rating system marked a time
   of resurgence for films of all type including anti-war films in the
   States. Robert Eberwein names two films as anti-war classics.^[164] The
   first is Jean Renoir's prisoner of war masterpiece^[148] La Grande
   Illusion (The Grand Illusion, 1937). Renoir's critique of contemporary
--
   mankind's common experiences should prevail above political division, and
   its extension: war.^[165] The second is Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory
   (1957). The critic David Ehrenstein writes that Paths of Glory established
   Kubrick as the "leading commercial filmmaker of his generation" and a
   world-class talent. Ehrenstein describes the film as an "outwardly
   cool/inwardly passionate protest drama about a disastrous French army
   maneuver and the court-martial held in its wake", contrasting it with the
   "classic" All Quiet on the Western Front's story of an innocent "unstrung
   by the horrors of war".^[166]
  Mixed genres[edit]
   Comedy gave scope for satire, and post-war film-makers merged comedy and
   anti-war sentiment in films as varied as Stalag 17 (1953) and Dr
   Strangelove (1964).^[167] Black comedies like Mike Nichols's Catch-22
   (1970), based on Joseph Heller's satirical novel about the Second World
   War, and Robert Altman's MASH (1970), set in Korea, reflected the
   attitudes of an increasingly sceptical public during the Vietnam
   War.^[168]
   Other genres were combined in Franklin J. Schaffner's Patton (1970), about
   real life General George S. Patton, where combat scenes were interleaved
   with commentary about how he waged war, showing good and bad sides to a
   command. It and MASH became the two most profitable war/anti-war films
   made up to that time,^[169] and Patton won seven Academy Awards.^[170]
