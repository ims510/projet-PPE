   MAYOR VARTIAINEN:  Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,
   it is my great pleasure to warmly welcome you all to the beautiful capital
   of Finland, Helsinki, and the Helsinki City Hall.  Helsinki has a great

   Helsinki in weeks – so confident that they had Dmitri Shostakovich compose
   music for the victory parade, before the Winter War even started.
   Like Putin in Ukraine, when Stalin failed to overcome the Finns’ fierce
--
   proposals to reduce tensions.  Together with our allies and partners, we
   used every forum to try to prevent war, from the NATO-Russia Council to
   the OSCE, from the UN to our direct channels.
--
   President Biden made clear that regardless of which path President Putin
   chose, we would be ready.  And if Russia chose war, we would do three
   things: support Ukraine, impose severe costs on Russia, and strengthen
--
   that no amount of diplomatic effort was going to change President Putin’s
   mind.  He would choose war.
   And so, on February 17, 2022, I went before the United Nations Security
   Council to warn the world that Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was
   imminent.
--
   We hoped – we hoped – to be proven wrong.
   Unfortunately, we were right.  A week after my warning to the Security
   Council, President Putin invaded.  Ukrainians of all walks of life –

   Today, what I want to do is set out this and the many other ways Putin’s
   war of aggression against Ukraine has been a strategic failure, greatly
   diminishing Russia’s power, its interests, and its influence for years to

   had significantly reduced its forces in Europe since the end of the Cold
   War, from 315,000 in 1989 to 61,000 at the end of 2013.  Many European
   countries’ spending on defense had been declining for years.  NATO’s
--
   European Union, and other partners around the world have severely degraded
   Russia’s war machine and defense exports, setting them back for years to
   come.  Russia’s global defense partners and customers can no longer count
--
   what it was, and a fraction of what it could have become had Putin
   invested in technology and innovation rather than weapons and war.
   Russia’s foreign reserves are down by more than half, as are profits from
--
   it.
   Sixth, prior to the war, President Putin regularly used Russia’s influence
   in international organizations to try to weaken the United Nations
--
   Charter.   And countries from every part of the world are supporting
   efforts to hold Russia accountable for its war crimes and crimes against
   humanity, from creating a special UN commission to document the crimes and
   human rights violations committed in Russia’s war to assisting
   investigations by prosecutors in Ukraine and at the International Criminal
--
   We have no quarrel with the Russian people, who had no say in starting
   this tragic war.  We lament that Putin is sending tens of thousands of
   Russians to their deaths in a war he could end now, if he chose – and
   inflicting ruinous impact on Russia’s economy and its prospects.  Indeed,
   it must be asked:  How has Putin’s war improved the lives, the
   livelihoods, or the prospects of ordinary Russian citizens?
--
   international rules and principles that are threatened by Putin’s ongoing
   war.
   Let me say this directly to the Russian people:  The United States is not
   your enemy.  At the peaceful end of the Cold War, we shared the hope that
   Russia would emerge to a brighter future, free and open, fully integrated
--
   strength of its economy and its democracy. This is at the heart of our
   vision for the way forward:  Ukraine must not only survive, it must
   thrive.  To be strong enough to deter and defend against aggressors beyond

   union formally granted Ukraine EU candidate status.  And Kyiv is working
   to make progress toward the EU’s benchmarks even as it fights for its
   survival.

   paves the way for diplomacy.  President Zelenskyy has said repeatedly that
   diplomacy is the only way to end this war, and we agree.  In December, he
   put forward a vision for a just and lasting peace.  Instead of engaging on
   that proposal or even offering one of his own, President Putin has said

   Russia killed in a single strike.  Two of the thousands of Ukrainian
   children killed by Russia’s war of aggression.  Thousands more have been
   wounded, and thousands beyond that have been abducted from their families
--
   All are part of a generation of Ukrainian children terrorized,
   traumatized, scarred by Putin’s war of aggression, all of whom remind us
   why Ukrainians are so fiercely committed to defending their nation and why

   Now, some have argued that if the United States truly wanted peace, we’d
   stop supporting Ukraine, and then if Ukraine truly wanted to end the war,
   it would just cut its losses and give up the fifth of its territory that
--
   neighbors of Russia would feel confident in their own sovereignty and
   territorial integrity if Putin’s aggression were to be rewarded with a
   fifth of Ukraine’s territory?
--
   to concrete actions, especially military withdrawal.  A just and lasting
   peace must end Russia’s war of aggression.
   Now, over the coming weeks and months, some countries will call for a
   ceasefire.  And on the surface, that sounds sensible – attractive, even. 
   After all, who doesn’t want warring parties to lay down their arms?  Who
   doesn’t want the killing to stop?

   a Potemkin peace.  It would legitimize Russia’s land grab.  It would
   reward the aggressor and punish the victim.
   If and when Russia is ready to work for true peace, the United States will

   original members of the Alliance gathered in Washington to sign its
   founding treaty.  President Truman warned the group, and I quote, “We
   cannot succeed if our people are haunted by the constant fear of

   individually against attack.  [W]e hope to create a shield against
   aggression and the fear of aggression – a bulwark which will permit us to
   get on with the real business of . . . achieving a fuller and happier life
--
   lives in constant fear of aggression.  That’s why we’ve all got a stake in
   ensuring that President Putin’s war of aggression against Ukraine
   continues to be a strategic failure.
