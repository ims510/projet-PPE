   War film is serious business. It has been from the beginning, when
   William Wellman’s Wings (1927) became the first World War I romantic
   drama to win an Oscar for best picture. One hundred years later, the
   supply of war films seems inexhaustible and their box-office attraction
   unbroken.

   The war film genre and its fascination remains.
   There we sit, watching generations get wiped out. We see terrifying
   technological inventions like the atomic bomb being dropped on
   Hiroshima. Removed from actual war in time and place, these big-screen
   productions are horrible yet spellbinding at the same time.

   War Horse (2011) is a particularly effective exploration of this
   experience and what it gives to audiences. Steven Spielberg’s film
   tells the story of a young horse and his owner forced from the idyllic
   fields of rural England into the bloody trenches of first world war
   France.
   War Horse illustrates the fragile balance of peace, and how sacrifice
   forms lasting bonds across borders, languages and species, echoing the
   Great War’s hard-won reconciliation process as Europeans bonded over
   grief and common trauma. Spielberg pairs moral guidance and a sense of

   fast-paced action sequences.
   But this is only one story and only one way to present war as a noble
   sacrifice to forge unity. There is no standard formula to explain why
   the experience of war continuously attracts millions of viewers. The
   answer is different for each war story, and it is different in each
   nation.
The national war complex
   The first Australian film to win an Academy Award was Damien Parer’s
   documentary of the fighting in New Guinea in 1942. The film garnered a
   Best Documentary Oscar for bringing the immediate experience of
   humanity at war to Australia: the wounded; the anxiety; the young
   soldiers’ fear of death far from home.

   Micronesia. His cinematic legacy is a sobering documentation of
   Australians at war without flagwavers or hyper-masculine action heroes.
   Damien Parer also shot photographs while in New Guinea, including this
   one at a rest spot on the Kokoda Trail. Australian War Memorial
   SBS recently ran a week of war films in the lead-up to ANZAC Day,
   leading with Churchill (2017), which portrays the inner world of
   Britain’s wartime prime minister.

   WWI nurse Vera Brittain’s literary memoirs and her calls for pacifism.
   SBS’s War Week included no actual documentary footage like that of
   Parer’s.
   Today, the idea of an authentic representation of war seems less
   appealing to audiences. Marvel Studios broke box-office records all
   over the world with its fantasy battle and sci-fi war film Avengers:
   Endgame (2019). Perhaps too much reality in depicting war, the starkest
   of all modern realities, is simply unbearable. And so the
   re-enchantment of war comes with laser battles and magic gauntlets.
Fact versus fiction
   How we explore war on film has sparked heated debates.
   One argument holds the true horror of war is increasingly obscured by
   technology, Hollywood star power, and clever marketing campaigns.

   (2001) and The Pacific (2010) caused controversy among military
   historians who accused the series of endorsing war nostalgia, making
   the audience take sides, and actively shaping collective modern memory
   through re-enacted combat scenes.
   War has been co-opted as an entertainment favourite in countries all
   across the world, allowing audiences to think of it as a metaphor to
   explore issues like sexism or mortality.
   One of the most popular South Korean war films, Jang Hoon’s The Front
   Line (2011), suggests the meaning of life cannot be found in senseless
   wars. The Cave (2019), a war documentary by Syrian director Feras
   Fayyad, shows how a group of female doctors in Ghouta struggle with

   Jackson’s film produces a modern war experience by enhancing
   documentary footage of the first world war. We see the real faces of
   war: they talk, they smoke makeshift cigarettes, they are shellshocked
   victims of their time.

   The result is a conflicting truth about war and how its memories grow
