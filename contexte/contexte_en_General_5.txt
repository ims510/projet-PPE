   The Russo-Ukrainian War^[c] is an ongoing international conflict between
   Russia and Ukraine, which began in February 2014.^[d] Following Ukraine's
   Revolution of Dignity, Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine and supported
   pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian military in the Donbas war.
   The first eight years of conflict also included naval incidents,
   cyberwarfare, and heightened political tensions. In February 2022, Russia
   launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and began occupying more of the
--
   and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) as independent states, starting
   the Donbas war. The separatists received considerable but covert support
   from Russia, and Ukrainian attempts to fully retake separatist-held areas
--
   agreements to end the conflict, but they were never fully implemented in
   the years that followed. The Donbas war settled into a violent but static
   conflict between Ukraine and the Russian and separatist forces, with many

   conducting inconclusive offensives in the Donbas, and in spring 2023 dug
   into positions ahead of another Ukrainian counteroffensive. The war has
   resulted in a refugee crisis and tens of thousands of deaths.

  Legality and declaration of war
   Further information: On conducting a special military operation
   No formal declaration of war has been issued in the ongoing
   Russo-Ukrainian War. When Putin announced the 2022 Russian invasion of
   Ukraine, he claimed to commence a "special military operation",
   side-stepping a formal declaration of war.^[40] The statement was,
   however, regarded as a declaration of war by the Ukrainian government^[41]
   and reported as such by many international news sources.^[42]^[43] While

   After the Minsk agreements, the war settled into static trench warfare
   around the agreed line of contact, with few changes in territorial
   control. The conflict was marked by artillery duels, special forces
   operations, and trench warfare. Hostilities never ceased for a substantial
   period of time, but continued at a low level despite repeated attempts at

   trenches, bunkers and tunnels, turning the conflict into static trench
