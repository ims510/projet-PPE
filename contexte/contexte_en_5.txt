   The term world war was first coined in September 1914 by German
   biologist and philosopher Ernst Haeckel. He claimed that "there is no

   unparalleled scale, devastation, and loss of life.^[7]

   A number of socialist parties initially supported the war when it began
   in August 1914.^[304] But European socialists split on national lines,
--
   Marxists and syndicalists being overborne by their patriotic support
   for the war.^[311] Once the war began, Austrian, British, French,
   German, and Russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current
   by supporting their countries' intervention in the war.^[312]
   Italian nationalism was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was
   initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions. One of
   the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of the
   war was Gabriele D'Annunzio, who promoted Italian irredentism and
   helped sway the Italian public to support intervention in the
   war.^[313] The Italian Liberal Party, under the leadership of Paolo
   Boselli, promoted intervention in the war on the side of the Allies and
   used the Dante Alighieri Society to promote Italian nationalism.^[314]
   Italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose
   it; some were militant supporters of the war, including Benito
   Mussolini and Leonida Bissolati.^[315] However, the Italian Socialist
   Party decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors were
   killed, resulting in a general strike called Red Week.^[316] The
   Italian Socialist Party purged itself of pro-war nationalist members,
   including Mussolini.^[316] Mussolini, a syndicalist who supported the
   war on grounds of irredentist claims on Italian-populated regions of
   Austria-Hungary, formed the pro-interventionist Il Popolo d'Italia and

   d'Italia to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the
   war.^[318]

   states that the nationalists were hostile to. Although the vast
   majority of Irish people consented to participate in the war in 1914
   and 1915, a minority of advanced Irish nationalists staunchly opposed
   taking part.^[323] The war began amid the Home Rule crisis in Ireland
   that had resurfaced in 1912, and by July 1914 there was a serious
   possibility of an outbreak of civil war in Ireland. Irish nationalists
   and Marxists attempted to pursue Irish independence, culminating in the
--
   concessions to nationalist feeling.^[325] However, opposition to
   involvement in the war increased in Ireland, resulting in the
   Conscription Crisis of 1918.
