   Psychological warfare (PSYWAR), or the basic aspects of modern
   psychological operations (PsyOp), have been known by many other names
   or terms, including Military Information Support Operations (MISO), Psy
   Ops, political warfare, "Hearts and Minds", and propaganda.^[1] The
   term is used "to denote any action which is practiced mainly by
--
   campaign against the Persian Empire.
   Since prehistoric times, warlords and chiefs have recognized the
   importance of weakening the morale of their opponents. In the Battle of
--
   Currying favor with supporters was the other side of psychological
   warfare, and an early practitioner of this was Alexander the Great, who
   successfully conquered large parts of Europe and the Middle East and
--
   Carcassonne as a result.
   During the Granada War, Spanish captain Hernán Pérez del Pulgar
   routinely employed psychological tactics as part of his guerrilla
--
   disinformation to his opponents, similar to the Operations Fortitude
   and Titanic in World War II.
World War I[edit]
   [170px-James_Bryce.jpg] Lord Bryce led the commission of 1915 to
   document German atrocities committed against Belgian civilians.
   The start of modern psychological operations in war is generally dated
   to World War I. By that point, Western societies were increasingly
   educated and urbanized, and mass media was available in the form of
--
   rounds.^[13]
   At the start of the war, the belligerents, especially the British and
   Germans, began distributing propaganda, both domestically and on the
--
   communications cable system then in operation. These capabilities were
   easily transitioned to the task of warfare.
   The British also had a diplomatic service that maintained good
--
   G. K. Chesterton, Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling and H. G. Wells. Over
   1,160 pamphlets were published during the war and distributed to
   neutral countries, and eventually, to Germany. One of the first
--
   Aerial leaflets were dropped over German trenches containing postcards
   from prisoners of war detailing their humane conditions, surrender
   notices and general propaganda against the Kaiser and the German
   generals. By the end of the war, MI7b had distributed almost 26 million
   leaflets. The Germans began shooting the leaflet-dropping pilots,
--
   civilians in German-occupied France and Belgium.^[16]
   At the start of the war, the French government took control of the
   media to suppress negative coverage. Only in 1916, with the
   establishment of the Maison de la Presse, did they begin to use similar
   tactics for the purpose of psychological warfare. One of its sections
   was the "Service de la Propagande aérienne" (Aerial Propaganda
--
   The Central Powers were slow to use these techniques; however, at the
   start of the war the Germans succeeded in inducing the Sultan of the
   Ottoman Empire to declare 'holy war', or Jihad, against the Western
   infidels. They also attempted to foment rebellion against the British
--
   the overthrow of the Tsar. This soon paid off when the Bolshevik
   Revolution took Russia out of the war.^[17]
World War II[edit]
   Adolf Hitler was greatly influenced by the psychological tactics of
   warfare the British had employed during World War I, and attributed the
   defeat of Germany to the effects this propaganda had on the soldiers.
--
   Germany's Fall Grün plan of invasion of Czechoslovakia had a large part
   dealing with psychological warfare aimed both at the Czechoslovak
   civilians and government as well as, crucially, at Czechoslovakia's
--
   support of UK and France through appeasement to occupy Czechoslovakia
   without having to fight an all-out war, sustaining only minimum losses
   in covert war before the Munich Agreement.
   At the start of the Second World War, the British set up the Political
   Warfare Executive to produce and distribute propaganda. Through the use
   of powerful transmitters, broadcasts could be made across Europe.
--
   Minister Winston Churchill made use of radio broadcasts for propaganda
   against the Germans. Churchill favoured deception; he said "In wartime,
   truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard

   During World War II, the British made extensive use of deception –
   developing many new techniques and theories. The main protagonists at

   deception and double agents helped define Allied deception strategy
   during the war, for which he has been referred to as "the greatest
   British deceiver of WW2".^[22]
   During the lead-up to the Allied invasion of Normandy, many new tactics
   in psychological warfare were devised. The plan for Operation Bodyguard
   set out a general strategy to mislead German high command as to the

   faked operations to prepare the ground for invasion and "leaked"
   misinformation about the Allied order of battle and war plans.

   traffic and visual deception. The British "Double Cross" anti-espionage
   operation had proven very successful from the outset of the war,^[25]
   and the LCS was able to use double agents to send back misleading
   information about Allied invasion plans.^[26] The use of visual
   deception, including mock tanks and other military hardware had been
   developed during the North Africa campaign. Mock hardware was created
   for Bodyguard; in particular, dummy landing craft were stockpiled to

   The Operation was a strategic success and the Normandy landings caught
   German defences unawares. Continuing deception, portraying the landings
   as a diversion from a forthcoming main invasion in the Calais region,

Vietnam War[edit]
   [170px-Vietnampropaganda.png] "Viet Cong, beware!" – South Vietnam
   leaflets urging the defection of Viet Cong.
   The United States ran an extensive program of psychological warfare
   during the Vietnam War. The Phoenix Program had the dual aim of
   assassinating National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (NLF or Viet
--
   The Vietcong and their forces also used a program of psychological
   warfare during this war. Trịnh Thị Ngọ([ṯɕïŋ˧ˀ˨ʔ tʰi˧ˀ˨ʔ ŋɔ˧ˀ˨ʔ]; 1931
   – 30 September 2016), also known as Thu Hương and Hanoi Hannah, was a
   Vietnamese radio personality. She made English-language broadcasts for
   North Vietnam directed at United States troops. During the Vietnam War,
   Ngọ became famous among US soldiers for her propaganda broadcasts on
--
   posts. She made three broadcasts a day, reading a list of newly killed
   or imprisoned Americans, and playing popular US anti-war songs in an
   effort to incite feelings of nostalgia and homesickness, attempting to
   persuade US GIs that the US involvement in the Vietnam War was unjust
   and immoral.^[29] A typical broadcast began as follows:
     How are you, GI Joe? It seems to me that most of you are poorly
     informed about the going of the war, to say nothing about a correct
     explanation of your presence over here. Nothing is more confused
     than to be ordered into a war to die or to be maimed for life
     without the faintest idea of what's going on.^[30]

   Most modern uses of the term psychological warfare refer to the
   following military methods:

          + Projecting repetitive and disturbing noises and music for long
            periods at high volume towards groups under siege like during
            Operation Nifty Package.

   Lerner also divides psychological warfare operations into three

   few dogmas advanced by Sykewarriors that is likely to endure as an

   World War II was predominantly one of truth (with certain
   exceptions).^[citation needed]
   In Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes, Jacques Ellul
   discusses psychological warfare as a common peace policy practice
   between nations as a form of indirect aggression. This type of

   important element of the People's Republic of China's military
   strategy.^[45]^[46]^[47] This type of warfare is rooted in the Chinese
   Stratagems outlined by Sun Tzu in The Art of War and Thirty-Six
   Stratagems. In its dealings with its rivals, China is expected to

   The term psychological warfare is believed to have migrated from
   Germany to the United States in 1941.^[65] During World War II, the
   United States Joint Chiefs of Staff defined psychological warfare
   broadly, stating "Psychological warfare employs any weapon to influence
   the mind of the enemy. The weapons are psychological only in the effect
   they produce and not because of the weapons themselves."^[66] The U.S.
   Department of Defense currently defines psychological warfare as:
