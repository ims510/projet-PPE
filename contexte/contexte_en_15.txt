   Psychological warfare (PSYWAR), or the basic aspects of modern
   psychological operations (PsyOp), have been known by many other names
   or terms, including Military Information Support Operations (MISO), Psy
   Ops, political warfare, "Hearts and Minds", and propaganda.^[1] The

   At the start of the war, the belligerents, especially the British and
   Germans, began distributing propaganda, both domestically and on the

   Aerial leaflets were dropped over German trenches containing postcards
   from prisoners of war detailing their humane conditions, surrender
   notices and general propaganda against the Kaiser and the German
   generals. By the end of the war, MI7b had distributed almost 26 million
   leaflets. The Germans began shooting the leaflet-dropping pilots,

   At the start of the war, the French government took control of the
   media to suppress negative coverage. Only in 1916, with the
   establishment of the Maison de la Presse, did they begin to use similar
   tactics for the purpose of psychological warfare. One of its sections
   was the "Service de la Propagande aérienne" (Aerial Propaganda

   The Central Powers were slow to use these techniques; however, at the
   start of the war the Germans succeeded in inducing the Sultan of the
   Ottoman Empire to declare 'holy war', or Jihad, against the Western
   infidels. They also attempted to foment rebellion against the British

   Revolution took Russia out of the war.^[17]

   broadly, stating "Psychological warfare employs any weapon to influence
   the mind of the enemy. The weapons are psychological only in the effect
   they produce and not because of the weapons themselves."^[66] The U.S.
