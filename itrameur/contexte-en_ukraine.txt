   MAYOR VARTIAINEN:  Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,
   it is my great pleasure to warmly welcome you all to the beautiful capital
   of Finland, Helsinki, and the Helsinki City Hall.  Helsinki has a great
--
   Helsinki in weeks – so confident that they had Dmitri Shostakovich compose
   music for the victory parade, before the Winter War even started.
   Like Putin in Ukraine, when Stalin failed to overcome the Finns’ fierce

   proposals to reduce tensions.  Together with our allies and partners, we
   used every forum to try to prevent war, from the NATO-Russia Council to
   the OSCE, from the UN to our direct channels.
--
   President Biden made clear that regardless of which path President Putin
   chose, we would be ready.  And if Russia chose war, we would do three
   things: support Ukraine, impose severe costs on Russia, and strengthen

   that no amount of diplomatic effort was going to change President Putin’s
   mind.  He would choose war.
   And so, on February 17, 2022, I went before the United Nations Security
   Council to warn the world that Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was
   imminent.
--
   We hoped – we hoped – to be proven wrong.
   Unfortunately, we were right.  A week after my warning to the Security
   Council, President Putin invaded.  Ukrainians of all walks of life –

   Today, what I want to do is set out this and the many other ways Putin’s

   had significantly reduced its forces in Europe since the end of the Cold
   War, from 315,000 in 1989 to 61,000 at the end of 2013.  Many European
   countries’ spending on defense had been declining for years.  NATO’s

   European Union, and other partners around the world have severely degraded
   Russia’s war machine and defense exports, setting them back for years to
   come.  Russia’s global defense partners and customers can no longer count

   what it was, and a fraction of what it could have become had Putin
   invested in technology and innovation rather than weapons and war.
   Russia’s foreign reserves are down by more than half, as are profits from

   it.
   Sixth, prior to the war, President Putin regularly used Russia’s influence
   in international organizations to try to weaken the United Nations

   Charter.   And countries from every part of the world are supporting
   efforts to hold Russia accountable for its war crimes and crimes against
   humanity, from creating a special UN commission to document the crimes and
   human rights violations committed in Russia’s war to assisting
   investigations by prosecutors in Ukraine and at the International Criminal

   We have no quarrel with the Russian people, who had no say in starting
   this tragic war.  We lament that Putin is sending tens of thousands of
   Russians to their deaths in a war he could end now, if he chose – and
   inflicting ruinous impact on Russia’s economy and its prospects.  Indeed,
   it must be asked:  How has Putin’s war improved the lives, the
   livelihoods, or the prospects of ordinary Russian citizens?

   international rules and principles that are threatened by Putin’s ongoing
   war.
   Let me say this directly to the Russian people:  The United States is not
   your enemy.  At the peaceful end of the Cold War, we shared the hope that
   Russia would emerge to a brighter future, free and open, fully integrated

   vision for the way forward:  Ukraine must not only survive, it must
   thrive.  To be strong enough to deter and defend against aggressors beyond

   Russia killed in a single strike.  Two of the thousands of Ukrainian
   children killed by Russia’s war of aggression.  Thousands more have been
   wounded, and thousands beyond that have been abducted from their families

   All are part of a generation of Ukrainian children terrorized,
   traumatized, scarred by Putin’s war of aggression, all of whom remind us
   why Ukrainians are so fiercely committed to defending their nation and why

   Now, some have argued that if the United States truly wanted peace, we’d
   stop supporting Ukraine, and then if Ukraine truly wanted to end the war,
   it would just cut its losses and give up the fifth of its territory that

   peace must end Russia’s war of aggression.

   “I don’t think that [the war] is a stalemate,” Ukrainian president
   Volodymyr Zelensky told NBC News’ Meet the Press on Sunday.

   Zelensky’s tensions with his generals reached a peak with Zaluzhny’s
   November 1 interview with The Economist. He asserted that the war had
   reached a “stalemate.” He conceded that “There will most likely be no deep
--
   What’s worse is that Zaluzhny implied that the stalemate would evolve into
   defeat for Ukraine. A stalemate entails a long war of attrition. In a

   that a long war “as a rule, in most cases, is beneficial to one of the
   parties to the conflict. In our particular case, it is the russian [sic]

   its military power.”
   Zaluzhny said that in a prolonged war, Ukraine will run out of the
   “required volume” of missiles and ammunition while Russia, despite
   sanctions, is increasing its production capabilities. And even if it
   didn’t run out of weapons, he added, it will run out of men: a war of

   European officials that the war has reached a stalemate.” NBC reports
   that, like Zaluzhny, “[s]ome U.S. military officials have privately begun

   building, from both within and without,, to turn to the diplomatic front
   and face the beginning of the end of the war.

   by an Israeli airstrike in a Damascus neighborhood, according to Iran’s
   official news agency IRNA and Britain-based opposition war monitor the
   Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
   This has led Tehran to call for reprisals, ratcheting up fears that this
   might be the match that ignites a wider Middle East war.
   Syria state news did not issue a statement, and Israel has declined
   comment.
   Israel either killed Mousavi as a warning to Iran — given Tehran’s support
   for the Houthis’ attacks on ships in the Red Sea, or as a provocation to
   beget an Iranian response that would give Israel the pretext to enlarge
   the war, or as a preparatory move to enlarge the war regardless of Iran’s
   response. Either one points to trouble.

   be a warning to Iran that Israel has the capacity and willingness to exact
   a price from Iran — even in areas where the Iranians may have presumed

   engender an Iranian response that would give Israel the pretext to enlarge
   the war. While the Biden administration has given Israel the green light
   to bomb Gaza to smithereens, Biden opposes an expansion of the war since
   that very likely could drag the U.S. into it.
   The debate inside the Israeli government is increasingly leaning toward
   expanding the war — they have already mobilized more than 300,000 troops
   and there is a growing belief in Israel that it simply is intolerable for
--
   Israeli argument is that next time it might be Hezbollah, and as a result,
   Israel has no choice but to expand the war. But unless there is an attack
   from Iran or Hezbollah itself, the U.S. may continue to oppose such a

   Israel via Hezbollah, the reasoning goes, and Israel can then use
   Hezbollah’s action as a pretext to not only expand the war to Lebanon —
   but also force the U.S. to go along with it.

   disrupt the arming of Hezbollah as well as its supply lines. As such, the
   assassination may be a preparatory move to enlarge the war regardless of
   Iran’s response to the killing of Mousavi.
--
   refuses to pressure Israel to accept a ceasefire in Gaza, tensions in the
   region will continue to rise and the Middle East will gravitate towards a
   regional war that very likely will engulf the U.S. as well. Biden may
   think that he can control these events and allow Israel to slaughter the

   He is likely wrong — and the American people may soon find themselves in
   yet another unnecessary war in the Middle East because of Biden’s

   in ending the war.
   Zelensky said that Ukraine would participate in a fourth round of talks

   As U.S.-China tensions have risen the past few years, several U.S. and
   Taiwanese officials have made alarming warnings that Beijing will launch
   an invasion of the island by 2027 or as early as 2025, potentially
   triggering a disastrous war between the two powers.
   So NBC News’ report Wednesday filling in some of the details of the

   collective sigh of relief from all those concerned about the security of
   Taiwan, let alone anyone worried about a direct U.S.-China war.
   But tell that to the hawks who dominate U.S. discourse on China, who

   strategic partnership was becoming increasingly challenging for the United

   Conversely, if it so choses, Beijing could play a constructive role in
   mediating between the parties to end this war. But so far China’s vague

   may have presumed, like many in the West, that the war would be over in a

   before the war, declaring it was all the West’s and Kyiv’s fault.
Address Beijing, Not Moscow
   The West has some options in trying to counter the impact of the deepening
   Chinese-Russian relationship on the war in Ukraine. The addressee must be
   China, not Russia, for as long as the war continues. First, China should
   be reminded that supplying lethal weapons to Russia will lead to secondary

   swift, robust response from NATO. Xi reportedly warned Putin in person
   that the use of nuclear weapons was inadmissible, although it is unclear

   ideological antipathy to the United States. Moreover, some countries
   understand that, as a result of this war, with shifting coalitions
   emerging, they may have more say in the global order going forward.
   While not countering that view, the West should make a better case for why
   a war far away in Europe does affect their future. If Russia can get away
