Lawrence
H

Keeley
from
Ramesseum
Thebes

The
earliest
evidence
of
prehistoric
warfare
is
a
Mesolithic
cemetery
in
Jebel
Sahaba
which
has
been
determined
to
be
about
years
old

Since
the
rise
of
the
state
some
years
ago
military
activity
has
occurred
over
much
of
the
globe

Estimates
for
total
deaths
due
to
war
vary
wildly

For
the
period
BCE
until
estimates
range
from
million
to
billion

In
one
estimate
primitive
warfare
prior
to
BCE
has
been
thought
to
have
claimed
million
victims
based
on
the
diseases

In

Before

Lawrence
H

Keeley
a
professor
at
the
University
of
Illinois
says
approximately
of
known
societies
throughout
history
engaged
in
at
least
occasional
warfare
and
many
fought
constantly

Keeley
describes
several
styles
of
primitive
combat
such
as
small
raids
large
raids
and
massacres

All
of
these
forms
of
warfare
were
used
by
primitive
societies
a
finding
supported
by
other
researchers

Keeley
explains
that
early
war
raids
were
not
well
organized
as
the
participants
did
not
have
any
formal
training

Scarcity
of
resources
meant
defensive
a
relatively
advanced
way
were
renowned
for
their
studied
cruelty

The
invention
of
gunpowder
and
its
eventual
use
in
warfare
together
with
the
acceleration
of
technological
advances
have
fomented
major
changes
to
war
itself

There
are
many
theories
about
the
motivations
for
war
but
no
consensus
about
which
are
most
common

Military
theorist
Carl
von
Clausewitz
said
Every
age
has
its
own
kind
of
war
its
own
limiting
conditions
and
its
own
peculiar
preconceptions

Psychoanalytic
Dutch
psychoanalyst
Joost
Meerloo
held
that
War
is
often


a
mass
discharge
of
accumulated
internal
rage
where



the
inner
fears
of
ideologies

By
this
theory
the
nation
state
preserves
order
in
the
local
society
while
creating
an
outlet
for
aggression
through
warfare

The
Italian
psychoanalyst
Franco
Fornari
a
follower
of
Melanie
Klein
thought
war
was
the
paranoid
or
projective
elaboration
of
mourning

Fornari
thought
war
and
violence
develop
out
of
our
love
need
our
wish
to
preserve
and
defend
the
sacred
object
to
which
we
are
attached
namely
our
early
mother
and
our
fusion
with
her

For
the
adult
nations
are
the
sacred
objects
that
generate
warfare

Fornari
focused
upon
sacrifice
as
the
essence
of
war
the
astonishing
willingness
of
human
beings
to
die
for
their
country
to
give
over
their
bodies
to
their
nation

Despite
Fornari
s
theory
that
man
s
altruistic
desire
for
self
sacrifice
for
a
noble
cause
is
a
contributing
factor
towards
war
few
wars
have
originated
from
a
desire
for
war
among
the
general
populace

Far
more
often
the
general
population
has
been
reluctantly
drawn
into
war
by
its
rulers

One
psychological
theory
that
looks
at
the
leaders
is
advanced
by
Maurice
Walsh

He
argues
the
general
populace
is
more
neutral
towards
war
and
wars
occur
when
leaders
with
a
psychologically
abnormal
disregard
for
human

War
is
caused
by
leaders
who
seek
war
such
as
Napoleon
and
Hitler

Such
leaders
most
often
come
to
power
in
times
of
crisis
when
the

opts
for
a
decisive
leader
who
then
leads

Several
theories
concern
the
evolutionary
origins
of
warfare

There
are
two
main
schools
One
sees
organized
warfare
as
emerging
in
or
after
the
Mesolithic
as
a
result
of
complex
social
organization
and
greater
population
density
and
competition
over
resources
the
other
sees
human
warfare
as
a
more
ancient
practice
derived
from
common
animal
tendencies
such
as
territoriality
and
sexual
competition

The
latter
school
argues
that
since
warlike
behavior
patterns
are
found
in
many
primate
species
such
as
chimpanzees
as
well
as
in
many
ant
species
group
conflict
may
be
a
general
feature
of
animal
social
behavior

Some
proponents
of
the
idea
argue
that
war
while
innate
has
been
intensified
greatly
by
developments
of
technology
and
social
organization
such
as
weaponry
and
states

Psychologist
and
linguist
Steven
Pinker
argued
that
war
related
behaviors
may
have
been
naturally
selected
in
the
ancestral
environment
due
to
the
individual

Crofoot
and

have
argued
that
warfare
if
defined
as
group
interactions
in
which
coalitions
attempt
to
aggressively
dominate
or
kill
arguing
that
social
factors
and
childhood
socialization
are
important
in
determining
the
nature
and

War
can
be
seen
as
a
growth
of
economic
competition
in
a
competitive

In
this

wars
begin
as
a
pursuit
of
markets
for
natural
resources
and
for
wealth

has
also

Main

Marxist
explanations
of
warfare
The
Marxist
theory
of
war
is
quasi
economic
in
that
it
states
all
modern
wars
are
caused
by
competition
for
resources
and
markets
between
great
imperialist
powers
claiming
these
wars
are
a
natural
result
of
capitalism

Marxist
economists
Karl
Kautsky
Rosa
Luxemburg
Rudolf
furnishes
food
enough
for
its
cultivators

Hence
it
is
that
you
murder
and
devour
one
another
that
you
wage
wars
and
that
many
among
you
perish
in
civil
strife

Let
hatred
therefore
depart
from
among
you
This
is
one
of
the
earliest
expressions
of
what
has
come
to
be
called
the
Malthusian
theory
of
war
in
which
wars
are
caused
by
expanding
populations
and
limited
resources

Thomas
Malthus
wrote
that
populations
always
increase
until
they
are
limited
by

disease
or
famine

Geoffrey
Parker
argues
that
what
distinguishes
the
Western
way
of
war
based
in
Western
Europe
chiefly
allows
historians
to
explain
its
extraordinary
success
in
conquering
most
of
the
world
after
The
Western
way
of
war
rests
upon
five
principal
foundations
technology
discipline
a
highly
aggressive
military
tradition
a
remarkable
capacity
to
innovate
and
to
respond
rapidly
to
the
innovation
of
others
and
from
about
onward
a
unique
system
of
war
finance

The
combination
of
all
five
provided
a
formula
for
military
success



The
outcome
of
wars
has
been
determined
less
by
technology
then
by
better
war
plans
the
achievement
of
surprise
greater
economic
strength
and
above
all
superior
discipline

Rationalism
is
an
international
relations
theory
or
framework

Rationalism
that
states
or
international
actors
are
rational
seek
the
best
possible
outcomes
for
themselves
and
desire
to
avoid
the
costs
of
war

Under
one

approach
rationalist
theories
posit
all
actors

bargain
would
be
better
off
if
war
did
not
occur
and
likewise
seek
to
understand
why

nonetheless
reoccurs

Under
another
rationalist
game
theory
without
bargaining
the
peace
war
game
optimal
strategies
can
still
be
found
that
depend
upon
number
of
iterations

In
Rationalist
Explanations

James
Fearon
examined
three
rationalist
explanations
for
why
some
countries
engage
in
war
Issue
indivisibilities
Commitment
problems
Issue
indivisibility

when
the
two
parties
cannot

countries

do
not
agree
on
either
who
would
win
a
war
between
them
or
the
magnitude
of
state
s
victory
or
loss

For
instance
Geoffrey
Blainey
argues
that
war
is
a
result
of
miscalculation
of
strength

He
cites
historical
examples
of
war
and
demonstrates
war
is
usually
the
outcome
of
a
diplomatic
crisis
which
cannot
be
solved
because
both
sides
have
conflicting
estimates
of
Within
the
rationalist
tradition
some
theorists
have
suggested
that
individuals
engaged
in
war
suffer
a
normal
level
of
cognitive
bias
but
are
still
as
rational
as
you
and
me


According
to
philosopher
The
rationalist
theory
focused
around
bargaining
is
currently
under
debate

The
Iraq
War
proved
to
be
an
anomaly
that
undercuts
the
validity
of
applying
rationalist
theory
to
some
wars

Political
science
The
statistical
analysis
of
war
was
pioneered
by
Lewis
Fry
Richardson
following
World
War
I

More
recent
databases
of
wars
and
armed
conflict
have
been
assembled
by
the
Correlates
of
War
Project
Peter
Brecke
and
the
Uppsala
Conflict
Data
Program

The
following
subsections
consider
causes
of
war
from
system
societal
and
individual
levels
of
analysis

This
kind
of
division
was
first
proposed
by
Kenneth
Waltz
in
Man
the
State
and
War
and
has
been
often
used
by
political
scientists
since
then



Balance
of
power
theory
States
have
the
goal
of
preventing
a
single
state
from
becoming
a
hegemon
and
war
is
the
result
of
the
would
be
hegemon
s
persistent
attempts
at
power
acquisition

In
this
view
an
international
system
with
more
equal
distribution
of
power
is
more
stable
and
movements
toward
unipolarity
are
destabilizing

However
evidence
has
shown
power
polarity
is
not
actually
a
major
factor
in
the
occurrence
of
wars



Power
transition
theory
Hegemons
impose
stabilizing
conditions
on
the
world
order
but
they
eventually
decline
and
war
occurs
when
a
declining
hegemon
is
challenged
by
another
rising
power
or
aims
to
preemptively
suppress
them

On
this
view
unlike
for
balance
of
power
theory
wars
become
more
probable
when
power
is
more
equally
distributed

This
power
preponderance
hypothesis
has
the
relationship
of
trade
to
peace
are
mixed
and
moreover
some
evidence
suggests
countries
at
war
do
not
necessarily
trade
less
with
each
other

Diversionary
theory
also
known
as
the
scapegoat
hypothesis
suggests
the
politically
powerful
may
use
war
to
as
a
diversion
or
to
rally
domestic
popular
support

This
is
supported
by
increased
use
of
force
as
a
function
of
need
for
internal
political
support
are
more
mixed

The
morality
of
war
has
been
the
subject
of
debate
for
thousands
of
years

The
two
principal
aspects
of
ethics
in
war
according
to
the
just
war
theory
are
jus
ad
bellum
and
jus
in
bello

Jus
ad
bellum
right
to
war
dictates
which
unfriendly
acts
and
circumstances
justify
a
proper
authority
in
declaring
war
on
another
nation

There
are
six
main
criteria
for
the
declaration
of
a
just
war
first
any
just
war
must
be
declared
by
a
lawful
authority
second
it
must
be
a
just
and
righteous
cause
with
sufficient
gravity
to
merit
fourth
a
just
belligerent
must
have
a
reasonable
chance
of
success
fifth
the
war
must
be
a
last
resort
and
sixth
the
ends
being
sought
must
be
proportional
to
means
being
used

driven
out
by
starvation

These
intentions
were
part
of
the
General
Plan
East


The
Oxford
Companion
to
World
War
II

Jus
in
bello
right
in
war
is
the
set
of
ethical
rules
when
conducting
war

The
two
main
principles
are
proportionality
and
discrimination

Proportionality
regards
how
much
force
is
necessary
and
morally
principle
of
discrimination
determines
who
are
the
legitimate
targets
in
a
war
and
specifically
makes
a
separation
between
combatants
who
it
is
permissible
to
kill
and
non
combatants
who
it
is
not

Failure
to
follow
these
rules
can
result
in
the
loss
of
legitimacy
for
the
just
war
belligerent

The
just
war
theory
was
foundational
in
the
creation
of
the
United
Nations
and
in
international
law
s
regulations
on
legitimate
war

ArticleVocabulary
War
is
generally
defined
as
violent
conflict
between
states
or
nations

Nations
go
to
war
for
a
variety
of
reasons

It
has
been
argued
that
a
nation
will
go
to
war
if
the
benefits
of
war
are
deemed
to
outweigh
the
disadvantages
and
if
there
is
a
sense
that
there
is
not
another
mutually
agreeable
solution

More
specifically
some
have
argued
that
wars
are
fought
primarily
for
economic
religious
and
political
reasons

Others
have
claimed
that
most
wars
today
are
fought
for
ideological
reasons

In
the
United
States
the
legal
power
to
declare
war
is
vested
in
Congress
however
the
president
is
the
commander
in
chief
of
the
military
so
he
or
she
holds
power
to
conduct
a
war
once
it
has
been
declared

In
many
instances
the
president
has
used
military
force
without
declaring
war

Just
War
Theory
In
Western
tradition
there
is
a
sense
that
the
reasons
for
war
must
be
just

This
idea
dates
back
to
ancient
times
but
is
most
clearly
traced
to
the
writings
of
St

Augustine
and
St

Thomas
Aquinas

They
attempted
to
justify
war
and
reconcile
it
with
the
Christian
belief
that
taking
a
human
life
is
wrong

To
Aquinas
a
war
must
be
just
in
both
the
reasons
for
going
to
war
and
how
war
is
fought

Reasons
for
going
to
war
jus
ad
bellum
are
just
if
war
is
declared
by
an
appropriate
authority
the
war
is
waged
for
a
just
cause
and
the
war
is
waged
for
just
intentions

An
appropriate
authority
is
a
proper
governing
authority

A
just
cause
may
include
addition
there
must
be
a
reasonable
chance
of
success
the
good
that
will
be
achieved
must
outweigh
the
bad
and
war
must
be
a
last
resort

Once
just
reasons
for
going
to
war
are
satisfied
conduct
in
the
war
jus
in
bello
must
be
just
as
well

Just
conduct
in
a
war
means
that
it
must
be
specific
and
proportional

That
is
noncombatants
and
civilians
must
not
used
and
harms
must
be
proportionate
to
the
goal
sought

Law
of
War
Some
of
the
just
war
theories
have
been
adopted
as
parts
of
international
agreements
and
incorporated
into
the
law
of
war
i
e

international
law
that
regulates
the
resort
to
armed
force
the
conduct
of
hostilities
and
the
protection
of
war
victims

The
Geneva
Conventions
for
example
are
a
series
of
international
treaties
that
are
designed
to
protect
noncombatants
civilians
and
prisoners
of
war

The
treaties
were
negotiated
in
Geneva
Switzerland
between
and


The
First
and
Second
Geneva
Conventions
apply
to
protecting
the
wounded
and
sick
as
well
as
medical
personnel
and
transports

The
Third
Geneva
Convention
applies
to
prisoners
of
war
and
the
Fourth
Geneva
Convention
applies
to
people
in
occupied
territories

Reflecting
changes
in
the
international
system
theories
of
war
have
passed
through
several
phases
in
the
course
of
the
past
three
centuries

After
the
ending
of
the
wars
of
religion
about
the
middle
of
the
th
century
wars
were
fought
for
the
interests
of
individual
sovereigns
and
were
limited
both
in
their
objectives
and
in
their
scope

The
art
of
maneuver
became
decisive
and
analysis
of
war
was
couched
accordingly
in
terms
of
strategies

The
situation
changed
fundamentally
with
the
outbreak
of
the
French
Revolution
which
increased
the
size
of
forces
from
small
professional
to
large
conscript
armies
and
broadened
the
objectives
of
war
to
the
ideals
of
the
revolution
ideals
that
appealed
to
the
masses
who
were
subject
to
conscription

In
the
relative
order
of
post
Napoleonic
Europe
the
mainstream
of
theory
returned
to
the
idea
of
war
as
a
rational
limited
instrument
of
national
policy

This
approach
was
best
articulated
by
the
Prussian
military
theorist
Carl
von
Clausewitz
in
his
famous
classic
On
War

War
I
which
was
total
in
character
because
it
resulted
in
the
mobilization
of
entire
populations
and
economies
for
a
prolonged
period
of
time
did
not
fit
into
the
Clausewitzian
pattern
of
limited
conflict
and
it
led
to
a
renewal
of
other
theories

These
no
longer
regarded
war
as
a
rational
instrument
of
state
policy

The
theorists
held
that
war
in
its
modern
total
form
if
still
conceived
as
a
national
state
instrument
should
be
undertaken
only
if
the
most
vital
interests
of
the
state
touching
upon
its
very
survival
are
concerned

Otherwise
warfare
serves
broad
ideologies
and
not
the
more
narrowly
defined
interests
of
a
sovereign
or
a
nation

Like
the
religious
wars
of
the
th
century
war
becomes
part
of
grand
designs
such
as
the
rising
of
the
proletariat
in
communist
eschatology
or
the
Nazi
doctrine
of
a
master
race

Some
theoreticians
have
gone
even
further
denying
war
any
rational
character
whatsoever

To
them
war
is
a
calamity
and
a
social
disaster
whether
it
is
afflicted
by
one
nation
upon
another
or
conceived
of
as
afflicting
humanity
as
a
whole

The
idea
is
not
new
in
the
aftermath
of
the
Napoleonic
Wars
it
was
articulated
for
example
by
Tolstoy
in
the
concluding
chapter
of
War
and
Peace


In
the
second
half
of
the
th
century
it
gained
new
currency
in
peace
research
a
contemporary
form
of
theorizing
that
combines
analysis
of
the
origins
of
warfare
with
a
strong
normative
element
aiming
at
its
prevention

Peace
research
concentrates
on
two
areas
the
analysis
of
the
international
system
and
the
empirical
study
of
the
phenomenon
of
war

World
War
II
and
the
subsequent
evolution
of
weapons
of
mass
destruction
made
the
task
of
understanding
the
nature
of
war
even
more
urgent

On
the
one
hand
war
had
become
an
intractable
social
phenomenon
the
elimination
of
which
seemed
to
be
an
essential
precondition
for
the
survival
of
mankind

On
the
other
hand
the
use
of
war
as
an
instrument
of
policy
was
calculated
in
an
unprecedented
manner
by
the
nuclear
superpowers
the
United
States
and
the
Soviet
Union

War
also
remained
a
stark
but
rational
instrumentality
in
certain
more
limited
conflicts
such
as
those
between
Israel
and
the
Arab
nations

Thinking
about
war
consequently
became
increasingly
more
differentiated
because
it
had

answer
questions

an

war
as
a
rational
instrument
of
foreign
policy
an
act
of
violence
intended
to
compel
our
opponent
to
fulfill
our
will

Modern
definitions
of
war
such
as
armed
conflict
between
political
units
generally
disregard
the
narrow
legalistic
definitions
characteristic
of
the
th
century
which
limited
the
concept
to
formally
declared
war
between
states

Such
a
definition
includes
civil
wars
but
at
the
same
time
excludes
such
phenomena
as
insurrections
banditry
or
piracy

Finally
war
is
generally
understood
to
embrace
only
armed
conflicts
on
a
fairly
large
scale
usually
excluding

Hybrid

The

conflict
has
also
included
elements
of
hybrid
warfare

Cyberwarfare

by

The

tensions
in
the
region
after
waves
of
Jewish
immigration

Following
World
War
I
the
Mandate
for
Palestine
included
a
binding
obligation
for
the
establishment
in
Palestine
of
a
national
home
for
the
Jewish
people


The
United
Nations
Partition
Plan
for
Palestine
was
never
implemented
and
provoked
the
Palestine
War

The
current
Israeli
Palestinian
status
quo
began
following
Israeli
military
occupation
of
the
West
Bank
and
Gaza
known
as
the
Palestinian
territories
in

Since

fought
five
wars

most
recent
in


The
two
parties
that
engage
in
direct
negotiation
are
the
Israeli
th
centuries
with
the
birth
of
major
nationalist
movements
among
the
Jews
and
among
the
Arabs
both
geared
towards
attaining
sovereignty
for
their
people
in
the
Middle
East

The
Balfour
Declaration
was
a
public
statement
issued
by
the
British
government
in
during
the
First
World
War
announcing
support
for
the
establishment
of
a
national
home
for
the
Jewish
people
in
Palestine

The
collision

those
two
movements

the
emergence
of

nationalism
after

Franco

into

The
renewed
violence
which
continued
sporadically
until
the
beginning
of
World
War

ended
with
around
casualties
mostly
from
the
Arab
side

With
the
eruption
of
World
War
II
the
situation
in
Mandatory
Palestine
calmed
down

It
allowed
a
shift
towards
a
more
moderate
stance
among
Palestinian
Arabs
under
the
leadership
of
the
Nashashibi
clan
and
demanded

By
the
end
of
World
War

a
crisis
over
the
fate
of

from

led
to
renewed
tensions
between

During
the
Six
Day
War
in
Israel
captured
the
West
Bank
the
Gaza
Strip
the
Golan
Heights
and
the
Sinai
Peninsula

Each
of
these
territories
except
the
Sinai
remain
under
Israeli
occupation

The
Six
Day
War
exerted
a
significant
effect
upon
Palestinian
nationalism
as
Israel
gained
military
control
of
the
West
Bank
from
Jordan
home
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
Palestinians
and
supported
the
Jordanian
army
during
the
War
of
Attrition
which
included
the
Battle
of
Karameh

However
the
Palestinian
base
in
Jordan
collapsed
with
the
Jordanian
Palestinian
civil
war
in


The
PLO
defeat
by
the
Jordanians
caused
most
of
the
Palestinian
militants
to
relocate
to
South
Lebanon
where
they
soon
took
over
large
areas
creating

so
called
Fatahland

Lebanon
War
Palestinian
insurgency
in
South
Lebanon
peaked
in
the
early
s
as
airplane
hijacking
campaigns
worldwide
which
drew
Israeli
retaliation

During
the
Lebanese
Civil
War
Palestinian
militants
continued
to
launch
attacks
against
Israel
while
also
battling
opponents
within
Lebanon

In
assassination
attempt
on
one
of
its
diplomats
by
Palestinians
the
Israeli
government
decided
to
take
sides
in
the
Lebanese
Civil
War
and
the
Lebanon
War
commenced

The
initial
results
for
Israel
were
successful

Most
Palestinian

were
defeated
within

weeks

of

a
that
is
the
highest
in

This
culminated
in
the
Israel
Hamas

when
Hamas
led
militant
groups
launched
a
surprise
attack
on
southern
Israel
from
the
Gaza
Strip
killing
hundreds
the
stated
goal
of
destroying
Hamas
and
controlling
Gaza
afterwards

Peace
process
yet
left
unanswered
by
Arafat
the
Palestinians
principal
failing
is
that
from
the
beginning
of
the
Camp
David
summit
onward
they
were
unable
either
to
say
yes
to
the
American
ideas
or
to
present

cogent
and
Palestinian
President
Yasser
Arafat
and
Israeli
Prime
Minister
Ehud
Barak

Barak
reportedly
put
forward
the
following
as
bases
for
negotiation
via
the
US
to
the
Palestinian
President
a
non
militarized
Palestinian
state
based
explicitly
on
the
UN
borders
established
before
the
Six
Day
War

It
offered
full
normalization
of
relations
with
Israel
in
exchange
for
the
withdrawal
of
its
forces
from
all
the
occupied
territories
The
peace
process
has
been
predicated
on
a
two
state
solution
thus
far
but
questions
have
been
raised
towards
both
sides
resolve
to
end
the
dispute

List
of
war
films
The
war
film
genre
is
not
necessarily
tightly
defined
the
American
Film
Institute
for
example
speaks
of
films
to
grapple
with
the
Great
War
without
attempting
to
classify
these

However
some
directors
and
critics
have
offered
at
least
tentative
definitions

The
director
Sam
Fuller
defined
the
genre
by
saying
that
a
war
film
s
objective
no
matter
how
personal
or
emotional
is
to
make
a
viewer
feel
war

John
Belton
identified
four
narrative
elements
of
the
war
film
within
the
context
of
Hollywood
production
a
the
suspension
of
civilian
morality
during
times
of
war
b
primacy
of
collective
goals
over
individual
motivations
c
rivalry
between
men
in
predominantly
male
groups
as
well
as
reintegration
of
veterans

The
fateful
nature
of
battle
scenes
means
that
war
films
often
end
with
them

IMG
John
Wayne
in
The
Longest
Day
The
film
critic
Stephen
Neale
suggests
that
the
genre
is
for
the
most
part
well
defined
and
uncontentious
since
war
films
are
simply
those
about
war
being
waged
in
the
th
century
with
combat
scenes
central
to
the
drama

However
Neale
notes
films
set
in
the
American
Civil
War
or
the
American
Indian
Wars
of
the
th
century
were
called
war
films
in
the
time
before
the
First
World
War

The
critic
Julian
Smith
argues
on
the
contrary
that
the
war
film
lacks
the
formal
boundaries
of
a
genre
like
the
Western
but
that
in
practice
successful
and
influential
war
films
are
about
modern
wars
in
particular
World
War
II
with
the
combination
of
mobile
forces
and
mass
killing

The
film
scholar
Kathryn
Kane
points
out
some
similarities
between
the
war
film
genre
and
the
Western

Both
genres
use
opposing
concepts
like
war
and
peace
civilization
and
savagery

War
films
usually
frame
World
War
II
as
a
conflict
between
good
and
evil
as
represented
by
the
Allied
forces
and
Nazi
Germany
whereas
the
Western
peoples

James
Clarke
notes
the
similarity
between
a
Western
like
Sam
Peckinpah
s
The
Wild
Bunch
and
war
movie
escapades
like
The
Dirty
Dozen

The
film
historian
Jeanine
Basinger
states
that
she
began
with
a
preconception
of
what
the
war
film
genre
would
be
namely
that
What
I
knew
in
advance
was
what
presumably
every
member
of
our
culture
would
know
about
World
War
II
combat
films
that
they
contained
a
hero
a
group

She
argues
that
the
combat
film
is
not
a
subgenre

the
only
genuine
kind
of

film

Since
she
notes
that
there
were

only

combat
films

in

view
these

are

by
the

that
are
only

However
other
critics
such
as
Russell
Earl

propose
a
far
broader
definition
of
war
film
to
include
films
that
deal
with

in

pushes

to

bravely

Once
war
with

was
declared
the

as

Pacific
War

Japanese
film
critics
worried
that

Western
film
techniques
their
film
output
failed
to
represent
native
Japanese
values

The
historian
John

found
that

films
had
been
largely
forgotten
as
losers
do
not

yet
they
were
so
subtle
and
skilful
that
Frank
Capra
thought
though
Great
Britain
could
figure

cultural
enemy


For
Japanese
film
makers
war
was
not
a
cause
but
more
like
a
natural
disaster
and
what
mattered
was
not
whom
one
fought
but
how
well


Asian
enemies
especially
the
Chinese
were
often
portrayed
as
redeemable
and
even
possible

partners

Japanese
wartime
films
do
not
glorify
war
but
present
the
Japanese
state
as
one
great
family
and
the
Japanese
people
as
that

level
the

also
victimized

According

Andrew

the

over

films
produced
in

of
the
s
and
s

War
film
production
in
the
United

and

reached
its
zenith
in
the
mid
s

Its
partly
because
it
celebrated
an
exclusively
British
victory
it
failed
in
the
American
market

A

which
won
the
Academy
Award
for
Best

that
year
and
Paths

were
released

Some
such
as
Bitter
Victory
focused
more
on
the
psychological
battle
between
officers
and
egotism
rather
than
events
during
the
war

The
Bridge
on
the
River
Kwai
brought
a
new
complexity
to
the
war
picture
with
a
sense
of
moral
uncertainty
surrounding
war

By
the
end
of
the
decade
the
sense
of
shared
achievement
which
had
been
common
in
war
films
began
to
evaporate
according
to
Pulver

Hollywood
films
in
the
s
and
s
could
display
spectacular
heroics
lives
of
the
men
the
more
realistic
film

The
formula
for
a
successful
war
film
consisted
according
to
Lawrence
Suid
of
a
small
group
of
ethnically
diverse
men
an
unreasonable
senior
officer
cowards
became
heroic
or
died

Jeanine
Basinger
suggests
that
a
traditional
war
film
should
have
a
hero
a
group
and
an
objective
and
that
the
group
should
contain
an
Italian
a
Jew
a
cynical
complainer
from
Brooklyn
a
adventure
films
such
as
The
Guns
of
Navarone

and
Where

These

the
war
as
a
backdrop
for
spectacular
action

spectaculars


However
its
cost
also
made
it
the
last
of
the
traditional
war
films
while
the
controversy

the

by
the
U

and

for

relations
changed
the
way

always

the

to
help
an

Kenneth

advised

he
suggested
using
documentaries

films
about

Michael

Clark
agreed
on
a
story
travelling
across
Canada
and
meeting
various
kind
tolerant
and
intelligent
Canadians
to
encourage
America
into
the

The
resulting
film
th
Parallel
became
the
top
film

offices

vilified

Anti

Lewis
Milestone
s
All
Quiet
on
the
Western
Front
The
anti
war
genre
began
with
films
about
the
First
World
War

Films
in
the
genre
are
typically
revisionist
reflecting
on
past
events
and
often
generically
blended

Lewis
Milestone
s
All
Quiet
on
the
Western
Front
was
unquestionably
powerful
and
an
early
anti
war
film
portraying
a
German
point
of
view
it
was
the
first
film
in
any
genre
to
win
two
Quiet
on
the
Western
Front
defined
the
genre
as
showing
the
brutality
of
war
the
amount
of
human
suffering
the
betrayal
of
men
s
trust
by
incompetent
officers

War
and
anti
war
films
often
prove
difficult
to
categorize
as
they
contain
many
generic
ambiguities

While
many
anti
war
films
criticize
war
directly
through
depictions
of
grisly
combat
in
past
wars
some
films
such
as
Penn
s
Alice
s
Restaurant
criticized
war
obliquely
by
poking
fun
at
such
things
as
the
draft
board

The
number
of
anti
war
films
produced
in
America
dipped
sharply
during
the
s
because
of
McCarthyism
and
the
Hollywood
blacklist

The
end
of
the
blacklist
and
the
introduction
of
the
MPAA
rating
system
marked
a
time
of
resurgence
for
films
of
all
type
including
anti
war
films
in
the
States

Robert
Eberwein
names
two
films
as
anti
war
classics

The
first
is
Jean
Renoir
s
prisoner
of
war
masterpiece
La
Grande
Illusion
The
Grand
Illusion


Renoir
s
critique
of
contemporary
mankind
s
common
experiences
should
prevail
above
political
division
and
its
extension
war

The
second
is
Stanley
Kubrick
s
Paths
of
Glory


The
critic
David
Ehrenstein
writes
that
Paths
of
Glory
established
Kubrick
as
the
leading
commercial
filmmaker
of
his
generation
and
a
world
class
talent

Ehrenstein
describes
the
film
as
an
outwardly
cool
inwardly
passionate
protest
drama
about
a
disastrous
French
army
maneuver
and
the
court
martial
held
in
its
wake
contrasting
it
with
the
classic
All
Quiet
on
the
Western
Front
s
story
of
an
innocent
unstrung
by
the
horrors
of
war


Mixed
genres
edit
Comedy
gave
scope
for
satire
and
post
war
film
makers
merged
comedy
and
anti
war
sentiment
in
films
as
varied
as
Stalag
and
Dr
Strangelove


Black
comedies
like
Mike
Nichols
s
Catch
based
on
Joseph
Heller
s
satirical
novel
about
the
Second
World
War
and
Robert
Altman
s
MASH
set
in
Korea
reflected
the
attitudes
of
an
increasingly
sceptical
public
during
the
Vietnam
War

Other
genres
were
combined
in
Franklin
J

Schaffner
s
Patton
about
real
life
General
George
S

Patton
where
combat
scenes
were
interleaved
with
commentary
about
how
he
waged
war
showing
good
and
bad
sides
to
a
command

It
and
MASH
became
the
two
most
profitable
war
anti
war
films
made
up
to
that
time
and
Patton
won
seven
Academy
Awards

unbroken

million

The
war
film
genre
and
its
fascination
remains

There
we
sit
watching
generations
get
wiped
out

We
see
terrifying
technological
inventions
like
the
atomic
bomb
being
dropped
on
Hiroshima

Removed
from

Submit
War
Horse
is
a
particularly
effective
exploration
of
this
experience
and
what
it
gives
to
audiences

Steven
Spielberg
s
film
tells
the
story
of
a
young
horse
and
his
owner
forced
from
the
idyllic
fields
of
rural
England
into
the
bloody
trenches
of
first
world
war
France

War
Horse
illustrates
the
fragile
balance
of
peace
and
how
sacrifice
forms
lasting
bonds
across
borders
languages
and
species
echoing
the
Great
War
s
hard
won
reconciliation
process
as
Europeans
bonded
over
grief
and
common
trauma

Spielberg
pairs
moral
guidance
and
a
sense
of
what
action
sequences

But
this
is
only
one
story
and
only
one
way
to
present
war
as
a
noble
sacrifice
to
forge
unity

There
is
no
standard
formula
to
explain
why
the
experience
of
war
continuously
attracts
millions
of
viewers

The
answer
is
different
for
each
war
story
and
it
is
different
in
each
nation

The
first
Australian
film
to
win
an
Academy

was
Damien

s

of
the

in


The
film
garnered
a

for
bringing

to
Australia
the

the

the

Micronesia

His
cinematic
legacy
is
a
sobering
documentation
of
Australians
at
war
without
flagwavers
or
hyper
masculine
action
heroes

Damien

also

memoirs
and
her

for

SBS

no

like
that

Today
the
idea
of

seems
less
appealing
to
audiences

Marvel

broke
box
office
records
all
over
the
world
with
its

and
sci
fi

film
Avengers

Perhaps
too
much
reality
in
depicting
war
the
starkest
of
all
modern
realities
is
simply
unbearable

And
so
the
re
enchantment
of
war
comes
with
laser
battles
and
magic
gauntlets

Fact
versus
fiction
How
we
explore
war
on
film
has
sparked
heated
debates

One
argument
holds
the
true
horror
of
war
is
increasingly
obscured
by
technology
Hollywood
star
power
and
clever
marketing
campaigns

and
The
Pacific
caused
controversy
among
military
historians
who
accused
the
series
of
endorsing
war
nostalgia
making
the
audience
take
sides
and
actively
shaping
collective
modern
memory
through
re
enacted
combat
scenes

War
has
been
co
opted
as
an
entertainment
favourite
in
countries
all
across
the
world
allowing
audiences
to
think
of
it
as
a
metaphor
to
explore
issues
like
sexism
or
mortality

South
Korean

how

Jackson

The

is
used
to
denote
any

practiced
mainly
by
psychological
Empire

Since
prehistoric
times
warlords
and
chiefs
have
recognized
the
importance
of
weakening
the
morale
of
their
opponents

In
the
Battle
of
Currying
favor
with
supporters
was
the
other
side
of
psychological
warfare
and
an
early
practitioner
of
this
was
Alexander
the
Great
who
successfully
conquered
large
parts
of
Europe
and
the
Middle
East
and
held
as
a
result

During

employed
psychological

as

of
his

and

in

I

Lord
Bryce
led
the
commission
of
to
document
German
atrocities
committed
against
Belgian
civilians

The
start
of
modern
psychological
operations
in
war
is
generally
dated
to
World
War
I

By
that
point
Western
societies
were
increasingly
educated
and
urbanized
and
mass
media
was
available
in
the
form
of
large
explosive
delivery
systems
like
modified
artillery
or
mortar
rounds

At
the
start
of
the
war
the
belligerents
especially
the
British
and
Germans
began
distributing
propaganda
both
domestically
and
on
the
communications
cable
system
then
in
operation

These
capabilities
were
easily
transitioned
to
the
task
of
warfare

The
British
also
had
a
diplomatic
service
that
maintained
good
relations
Thomas
Hardy
Rudyard
Kipling
and
H

G

Wells

Over
pamphlets
were
published
during
the
war
and
distributed
to
neutral
countries
and
eventually
to
Germany

One
of
the
first
significant
publications
the
Aerial
leaflets
were
dropped
over
German
trenches
containing
postcards
from
prisoners
of
war
detailing
their
humane
conditions
surrender
notices
and
general
propaganda
against
the
Kaiser
and
the
German
generals

By
the
end
of
the
war
MI
b
had
distributed
almost
million
leaflets

The
Germans
began
shooting
the
leaflet
dropping
pilots
prompting
the
British
Belgium

At
the
start
of
the
war
the
French
government
took
control
of
the
media
to
suppress
negative
coverage

Only
in
with
the
establishment
of
the
Maison
de
la
Presse
did
they
begin
to
use
similar
tactics
for
the
purpose
of
psychological
warfare

One
of
its
sections
was
the
Service
de
la
Propagande
a
rienne
Aerial
Propaganda
Service
headed
by
Professor
The
Central
Powers
were
slow
to
use
these
techniques
however
at
the
start
of
the
war
the
Germans
succeeded
in
inducing
the
Sultan
of
the
Ottoman
Empire
to
declare
holy
war
or
Jihad
against
the
Western
infidels

They
also
attempted
to
foment
rebellion
against
the
British
overthrow
of
the
Tsar

This
soon
paid
off
when
the
Bolshevik
Revolution
took
Russia
out
of
the
war

World
War
II
edit
Adolf
Hitler
was
greatly
influenced
by
the
psychological
tactics
of
warfare
the
British
had
employed
during
World
War
I
and
attributed
the
defeat
of
Germany
to
the
effects
this
propaganda
had
on
the
soldiers

He
Germany
s
Fall
Gr
n
plan
of

of

had
a
large
part
dealing
with
psychological
warfare
aimed
both
at
the
Czechoslovak
civilians
and
government
as
well
as
crucially
at
Czechoslovakia
s
of
UK
and
France
through
appeasement
to
occupy
Czechoslovakia
without
having
to
fight
an
all
out
war
sustaining
only
minimum
losses
in
covert
war
before
the
Munich
Agreement

At
the
start
of
the
Second
World
War
the
British
set
up
the
Political
Warfare
Executive
to
produce
and
distribute
propaganda

Through
the
use
of
powerful
transmitters
broadcasts
could
be
made
across
Europe

Sefton
made
use
of
radio
broadcasts
for
propaganda
against
the
Germans

Churchill
favoured
deception
he
said
In
wartime
truth
is
so
precious
that
she
should
always
be
attended
by
a
bodyguard
of
lies



Bodyguard

During
World
War
II
the
British
made
extensive
use
of
deception
developing
many
new
techniques
and
theories

The
main
protagonists
at
this
deception
and
double
agents
helped
define
Allied
deception
strategy
during
the
war
for
which
he
has
been
referred
to
as
the
greatest
British
deceiver
of
WW


During
the
lead
up
to
the
Allied
invasion
of
Normandy
many
new
tactics
in
psychological
warfare
were
devised

The
plan
for
Operation
Bodyguard
set
out
a
general
strategy
to
mislead
German
high
command
as
to
the
date
and
ground
for
invasion
and
leaked
misinformation
about
the
Allied
order
of
battle
and
war
plans

Elaborate
naval
deceptions

The
British
Double
Cross
anti
espionage
operation
had
proven
very
successful
from
the
outset
of
the
war
and
the
LCS
was
able
to
use
double
agents
to
send
back
misleading
information
about
Allied
invasion
plans

The
use
of
visual
deception
including
mock
tanks
and
other
military
hardware
had
been
developed
during
the
North
Africa
campaign

Mock

Most
modern
uses
of
the
term
psychological
warfare
refer
to
the
following
military
methods
Projecting
repetitive
and
disturbing
noises
and
music
for
long
periods
at
high
volume
towards
groups
under

Most
of

earlier

have
been
used
to
some
degree
in

conflict

Measuring
the
success
or
failure
of
psychological
warfare
is
very
hard
as
the
conditions
are
very
far
from
being
a
controlled
experiment

Lerner
also
divides
psychological
warfare
operations
into
three
categories
page
needed
and
discredits
the
source

He
writes
This
is
one
of
the
few
dogmas
advanced
by
Sykewarriors
that
is
likely
to
endure
as
an
axiom
of
propaganda
Credibility
is
a
condition
of
persuasion

Before
you
can
make
a
man
do
as
you
say
you
must
make
him
believe
what
you
say

Consistent
with
this
idea
the
Allied
strategy
in

one

In
Propaganda
The
Formation

Men
s
Attitudes
Jacques
Ellul
discusses
psychological
warfare
as
a
common
peace
policy
practice
between
nations
as
a
form
of
indirect
aggression

This
type
of
propaganda
drains
the
public
important
element
of
the
People
s
Republic
of
China
s
military
strategy

This
type
of
warfare
is
rooted
in
the
Chinese
Stratagems
outlined
by
Sun
Tzu
in
The
Art
of

In
its
dealings
with
its

China
is
expected
to
utilize

to
keep
a
tight
hold

The
term
psychological

is

to
have
migrated
from
Germany
to
the
United
States
in


During
World
War
II
the
United
States
Joint
Chiefs
of
Staff
defined
psychological
warfare
broadly
stating
Psychological
warfare
employs
any
weapon
to
influence
the
mind
of
the
enemy

The
weapons
are
psychological
only
in
the
effect
they
produce
and
not
because
of
the
weapons
themselves

The
U
S

Department
of
Defense
currently
defines
psychological
warfare
as
The
planned
use
of
propaganda
and
other
psychological
actions
having
information
