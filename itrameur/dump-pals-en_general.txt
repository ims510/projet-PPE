War
is
an
intense
armed
conflict
a
between
states
governments
societies
or
paramilitary
groups
such
as
mercenaries
insurgents
and
militias

It
is
generally
characterized
by
extreme
violence
destruction
and
mortality
using
regular
or
irregular
military
forces

Warfare
refers
to
the
common
activities
and
characteristics
of
types
of
war
or
of
wars
in
general

Total
war
is
warfare
that
is
not
restricted
to
purely
legitimate
military
targets
and
can
result
in
massive
civilian
or
other
non
combatant
suffering
and
casualties

While
some
war
studies
scholars
consider
war
a
universal
and
ancestral
aspect
of
human
nature
others
argue
it
is
a
result
of
specific
socio
cultural
economic
or
ecological
circumstances

Etymology
IMG
Mural
of
War
by
Gari
Melchers
The
English
word
war
derives
from
the
th
century
Old
English
words
wyrre
and
werre
from
Old
French
werre
also
guerre
as
in
modern
French
in
turn
from
the
Frankish
werra
ultimately
deriving
from
the
Proto
Germanic
werz
mixture
confusion


The
word
is
related
to
the
Old
Saxon
werran
Old
High
German
werran
and
the
modern
German
verwirren
meaning
to
confuse
to
perplex
to
bring
into
confusion

The
Egyptian

of
Dapur
in
the
th
century
BCE
from
Ramesseum
Thebes

The
earliest
evidence
of
prehistoric
warfare
is
a
Mesolithic
cemetery
in
Jebel
Sahaba
which
has
been
determined
to
be
about
years
old

About
forty
five
percent
of
the
skeletons
there
displayed
signs
of
violent
death
specifically
traumatic
bone
lesions

Since
the
rise
of
the
state
some
years
ago
military
activity
has
occurred
over
much
of
the
globe

Estimates
for
total
deaths
due
to
war
vary
wildly

For
the
period
BCE
until
estimates
range
from
million
to
billion

In
one
estimate
primitive
warfare
prior
to
BCE
has
been
thought
to
have
claimed
million
victims
based
on
the
assumption
that
it
accounted
for
the


of
all
deaths

For

In
War
Before
Civilization
Lawrence
H

Keeley
a
professor
at
the
University
of
Illinois
says
approximately
of
known
societies
throughout
history
engaged
in
at
least
occasional
warfare
and
many
fought
constantly

Keeley
describes
several
styles
of
primitive
combat
such
as
small
raids
large
raids
and
massacres

All
of
these
forms
of
warfare
were
used
by
primitive
societies
a
finding
supported
by
other
researchers

Keeley
explains
that
early
war
raids
were
not
well
organized
as
the
participants
did
not
have
any
formal
training

Scarcity
of
resources
meant
defensive
works
were
not
a
cost
effective
way
to
protect
the
society
against
enemy
raids

William
Rubinstein
wrote
Pre
literate
societies
even
those
organized
in
a
relatively
advanced
way
were
renowned
for
their
studied
cruelty

The
invention
of
gunpowder
and
its
eventual
use
in
warfare
together
with
the
acceleration
of
technological
advances
have
fomented
major
changes
to
war
itself

in

of

pace

was

In
in
view
of
the
rapidly
increasingly
destructive
consequences
of
modern
warfare
and
with
a
particular
concern
for
the
consequences
and
costs
of
the
newly
developed
atom
bomb
Albert
Einstein
famously
stated
I
know
not
with
what
weapons
World
War
III
will
be
fought
but
World
War
IV
will
be
fought
with
sticks
and
stones

Mao
Zedong
urged
the
socialist
camp
not
to
fear
nuclear
war
with
the
United
States
since
even
if
half
of
mankind
died
the
other
half
would
remain
while
imperialism
would
be
razed
to
the
ground
and
the
whole
world
would
become
socialist

A
distinctive
feature
of
war
since
is
that
combat
has
largely
been
a
matter
of
civil
wars
and
insurgencies

The
major
exceptions
were
the
Korean

decline
in
the
number
and
severity
of
armed
conflicts
since
the
end

However
the
evidence
examined

Types
of
warfare
Main
article
Types
of
war
Asymmetric
warfare
is
the
methods
used
in
conflicts
between
belligerents
of
drastically
different
levels
of
military
capability
or
size

Biological
warfare
or
germ
warfare
is
the
use
of
biological
infectious
agents
or
toxins
such
as
bacteria
viruses
and
fungi
against
people
plants
or
animals

This
can
be
conducted
through
sophisticated
technologies
like
cluster
munitions
or
with
rudimentary
techniques
like
catapulting
an
infected
corpse
behind
enemy
lines
and
can
include
weaponized
or
non
weaponized
pathogens

Chemical
warfare
involves
the
use
of
weaponized
chemicals
in
combat

Poison
gas
as
a
chemical
weapon
was
principally
used
during
World
War
I
and
resulted
in
over
a
million
estimated
casualties
including
more
than
civilians

Cold
warfare
is
an
intense
international
rivalry
without
direct
military
conflict
but
with
a
sustained
threat
of
it
including
high
levels
of
military
preparations
expenditures
and
development
and
may
involve
active
conflicts
by
indirect
means
such
as
economic
warfare
political
warfare
covert
operations
espionage
cyberwarfare
or
proxy
wars

Conventional
warfare
is
a
form
of
warfare
between
states
in
which
nuclear
biological
or
chemical
weapons
are
not
used
or
see
limited
deployment

Cyberwarfare
involves
the
actions
by
a
nation
state
or
international
organization
to
attack
and
attempt
to
damage
another
nation
s
information
systems

Insurgency
is
a
rebellion
against
authority
when
those
taking
part
in
the
rebellion
are
not
recognized
as
belligerents
lawful
combatants


An
insurgency
can
be
fought
via
counterinsurgency
and
may
also
be
opposed
by
measures
to
protect
the
population
and
by
political
and
economic
actions
of
various
kinds
aimed
at
undermining
the
insurgents
claims
against
the
incumbent
regime

Information
warfare
is
the
application
of
destructive
force
on
a
large
scale
against
information
assets
and
systems
against
the
computers
and
networks
that
support
the
four
critical
infrastructures
the
power
grid
communications
financial
and
transportation


Nuclear
warfare
is
warfare
in
which
nuclear
weapons
are
the
primary
or
a
major
method
of
achieving
capitulation

Total
war
is
warfare
by
any
means
possible
disregarding
the
laws
of
war
placing
no
limits
on
legitimate
military
targets
using
weapons
and
tactics
resulting
in
significant
civilian
casualties
or
demanding
a
war
effort
requiring
significant
sacrifices
by
the
friendly
civilian
population

Unconventional
warfare
the
opposite
of
conventional
warfare
is
an
attempt
to
achieve
military
victory
through
acquiescence
capitulation
or
clandestine
support
for
one
side
of
an
existing
conflict

fluctuated

little

However
major

over

periods
have
resulted
in
much
higher
casualty
rates
with
casualties

over
a
few
years

While
conventional
wisdom
holds
that
casualties
have
increased
in
recent
times
due
to
technological
improvements
in
warfare
this
is
not
generally
true

For
instance
the
Thirty
Years
War
had
about
the
same
number
of
casualties
per
capita
as
World
War
I
although
it
was
higher
during
World
War
II
WWII


That
said
overall
the
number
of
casualties
from
war
has
not
significantly
increased
in
recent
times

Quite
to
the
contrary
on
a
global
scale
the
time
since
WWII
has
been
unusually
peaceful

There
are
many
theories
about
the
motivations
for
war
but
no
consensus
about
which
are
most
common

Military
theorist
Carl
von
Clausewitz
said
Every
age
has
its
own
kind
of
war
its
own
limiting
conditions
and
its
own
peculiar
preconceptions

Psychoanalytic
Dutch
psychoanalyst
Joost
Meerloo
held
that
War
is
often


a
mass
discharge
of
accumulated
internal
rage
where



the
inner
fears
of
mankind
are
discharged
in
mass
destruction

Other
psychoanalysts
such
as
E
F
M

Durban
and
John
Bowlby
have
argued
human
beings
are
inherently
violent

This
aggressiveness
is
fueled
by
displacement
and
projection
where
a
person
transfers
his
or
her
grievances
into
bias
and
hatred
against
other
races
religions
nations
or
ideologies

By
this
theory
the
nation
state
preserves
order
in
the
local
society
while
creating
an
outlet
for
aggression
through
warfare

The
Italian
psychoanalyst
Franco
Fornari
a
follower
of
Melanie
Klein
thought
war
was
the
paranoid
or
projective
elaboration
of
mourning

Fornari
thought
war
and
violence
develop
out
of
our
love
need
our
wish
to
preserve
and
defend
the
sacred
object
to
which
we
are
attached
namely
our
early
mother
and
our
fusion
with
her

For
the
adult
nations
are
the
sacred
objects
that
generate
warfare

Fornari
focused
upon
sacrifice
as
the
essence
of
war
the
astonishing
willingness
of
human
beings
to
die
for
their
country
to
give
over
their
bodies
to
their
nation

Despite
Fornari
s
theory
that
man
s
altruistic
desire
for
self
sacrifice
for
a
noble
cause
is
a
contributing
factor
towards
war
few
wars
have
originated
from
a
desire
for
war
among
the
general
populace

Far
more
often
the
general
population
has
been
reluctantly
drawn
into
war
by
its
rulers

One
psychological
theory
that
looks
at
the
leaders
is
advanced
by
Maurice
Walsh

He
argues
the
general
populace
is
more
neutral
towards
war
and
wars
occur
when
leaders
with
a
psychologically
abnormal
disregard
for
human
life
are
placed
into
power

War
is
caused
by
leaders
who
seek
war
such
as
Napoleon
and
Hitler

Such
leaders
most
often
come
to
power
in
times
of
crisis
when
the
populace
opts
for
a
decisive
leader
who
then
leads
the
nation
to
war

Naturally
the
common
people
don
t
want
war
neither
in
Russia
nor
in
England
nor
in
America
nor
for
that
matter
in
Germany

That
is
understood

But
after
all
it
is
the
leaders
of
the
country
who
determine
the
policy
and
it
is
always
a
simple
matter
to
drag
the
people
along
whether
it
is
a
democracy
or
a
fascist
dictatorship
or
a
Parliament
or
a
Communist
dictatorship





the
people
can
always
be
brought
to
the
bidding
of
the
leaders

That
is
easy

All
you
have
to
do
is
tell
them
they
are
being
attacked
and
denounce
the
pacifists
for
lack
of
patriotism
and
exposing
the
country
to
danger

It
works
the
same
way
in
any
country

Several
theories
concern
the
evolutionary
origins
of
warfare

There
are
two
main
schools
One
sees
organized
warfare
as
emerging
in
or
after
the
Mesolithic
as
a
result
of
complex
social
organization
and
greater
population
density
and
competition
over
resources
the
other
sees
human
warfare
as
a
more
ancient
practice
derived
from
common
animal
tendencies
such
as
territoriality
and
sexual
competition

The
latter
school
argues
that
since
warlike
behavior
patterns
are
found
in
many
primate
species
such
as
chimpanzees
as
well
as
in
many
ant
species
group
conflict
may
be
a
general
feature
of
animal
social
behavior

Some
proponents
of
the
idea
argue
that
war
while
innate
has
been
intensified
greatly
by
developments
of
technology
and
social
organization
such
as
weaponry
and
states

Psychologist
and
linguist
Steven
Pinker
argued
that
war
related
behaviors
may
have
been
naturally
selected
in
the
ancestral
environment
due
to
the
benefits
of
victory

b
He
also
argued
that
in
order
to
have
credible
deterrence
against
other
groups
as
well
as
on
an
individual
level
it
was
important
to
have
a
reputation
for
retaliation
causing
humans
to
develop
instincts
for
revenge
as
well
as
for
protecting

that

if
defined
as
group
interactions
in
which
coalitions
attempt
to
aggressively
dominate
or
kill
members
of
other
groups
is
a
characteristic
of
most
human
societies

Those
in
which
it
has
been
lacking
tend
to
be
societies
that
were
politically
dominated
by
their
neighbors

Montagu
strongly
denied
universalistic
instinctual
arguments
arguing
that
social
factors
and
childhood
socialization
are
important
in
determining
the
nature
and
presence
of
warfare

Thus
he
argues
warfare
is
not
a
universal
human
occurrence
and
appears
to
have
been
a
historical
invention
associated
with
certain
types
of
human
societies

Montagu
s
argument
is

In

for

War
has

linked

development
by
economic
historians
and
development
economists
studying

and

While
this

Marxist
explanations
of
warfare
The
Marxist
theory
of
war
is
quasi
economic
in
that
it
states
all
modern
wars
are
caused
by
competition
for
resources
and
markets
between
great
imperialist
powers
claiming
these
wars
are
a
natural
result
of
capitalism

Marxist
economists
Karl
Kautsky
Rosa
Luxemburg
Rudolf
Hilferding
and
Vladimir
Lenin
theorized
that
imperialism
was
the
result
of
capitalist
countries
needing
new
markets

Expansion
of
the
means
of
production
is
only
possible
if
there
is
a
corresponding
growth
in
consumer
demand

Since
the
workers
in
a
capitalist
economy
would
be
unable
to
fill
the
demand
producers
must
expand
into
non
capitalist
markets
to
find
consumers
for
their
goods
hence
driving
imperialism

source

Pope
Urban
II
in
on
the
eve
of
the
First
Crusade
advocating
Crusade
as
a
solution
to
European
overpopulation
said
For
this
land
which
you
now
inhabit
shut
in
on
all
sides
by
the
sea
and
the
mountain
peaks
is
too
narrow
for
your
large
population
it
scarcely
furnishes
food
enough
for
its
cultivators

Hence
it
is
that
you
murder
and
devour
one
another
that
you
wage
wars
and
that
many
among
you
perish
in
civil
strife

Let

Enter

Holy
Sepulchre
wrest

race
and
subject
it

This
is
one
of
the
earliest
expressions
of
what
has
come
to
be
called
the
Malthusian
theory
of
war
in
which
wars
are
caused
by
expanding
populations
and
limited
resources

wrote
that

always
increase

According

who
proposed

theory
in

most
generalized
form
a

occurs
when

as

as

Geoffrey
Parker
argues
that
what
distinguishes
the
Western
way
of
war
based
in
Western
Europe
chiefly
allows
historians
to
explain
its
extraordinary
success
in
conquering
most
of
the
world
after
The
Western
way
of
war
rests
upon
five
principal
foundations
technology
discipline
a
highly
aggressive
military
tradition
a
remarkable
capacity
to
innovate
and
to
respond
rapidly
to
the
innovation
of
others
and
from
about
onward
a
unique
system
of
war
finance

The
combination
of
all
five
provided
a
formula
for
military
success



The
outcome
of
wars
has
been
determined
less
by
technology
then
by
better
war
plans
the
achievement
of
surprise
greater
economic
strength
and
above
all
superior
discipline

Parker
argues
that
Western
armies
were
stronger
because
they
emphasized
discipline
that
is
the
ability
of
a
formation
to
stand
fast
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
where
they
re
attacking
or
being
attacked
without
giving
way
to
the
natural
impulse
of
fear
and
panic

Discipline
came
from
drills
and
marching
in
formation
target
practice
and
creating
small
artificial
kinship
groups
such
as
the
company
and
the
platoon
to
enhance
psychological
cohesion
and
combat
efficiency

Rationalism
is
an
international
relations
theory
or
framework

Rationalism
and
Neorealism
international
relations
operate
under
the
assumption
that
states
or
international
actors
are
rational
seek
the
best
possible
outcomes
for
themselves
and
desire
to
avoid
the
costs
of
war

Under
one
game
theory
approach
rationalist
theories
posit
all
actors
can
bargain
would
be
better
off
if
war
did
not
occur
and
likewise
seek
to
understand
why
war
nonetheless
reoccurs

Under
another
rationalist
game
theory
without
bargaining
the
peace
war
game
optimal
strategies
can
still
be
found
that
depend
upon
number
of
iterations
played

In
Rationalist
Explanations
for
War
James
Fearon
examined
three
rationalist
explanations
for
why
some
countries
engage
in
war
Issue
indivisibilities
Incentives
to
misrepresent
or
information
asymmetry
Commitment
problems
Issue
indivisibility
occurs
when
the
two
parties
cannot
avoid
war
by
bargaining
because
the
thing
over
which
they
are
fighting
cannot
be
shared
between
them
but
only
owned
entirely
by
one
side
or
the
other

Information
asymmetry
with
incentives
to
misrepresent
occurs
when
two
countries
have
secrets
about
their
individual
capabilities
and
do
not
agree
on
either
who
would
win
a
war
between
them
or
the
magnitude
of
state
s
victory
or
loss

For
instance
Geoffrey
Blainey
argues
that
war
is
a
result
of
miscalculation
of
strength

He
cites
historical
examples
of
war
and
demonstrates
war
is
usually
the
outcome
of
a
diplomatic
crisis
which
cannot
be
solved
because
both
sides
have
conflicting
estimates
of
their
bargaining
power

Thirdly
bargaining
may
fail
due
to
the
states
inability
to
make
credible
commitments

Within
the
rationalist
tradition
some
theorists
have
suggested
that
individuals
engaged
in
war
suffer
a
normal
level
of
cognitive
bias
but
are
still
as
rational
as
you
and
me


According
to
philosopher
Iain
King
Most
instigators
of
conflict
overrate
their
chances
of
success
while
most
participants
underrate
their
chances
of
injury




King
asserts
that
Most
catastrophic
military
decisions
are
rooted
in
groupthink
which
is
faulty
but
still
rational

The
rationalist
theory
focused
around
bargaining
is
currently
under
debate

The
Iraq
War
proved
to
be
an
anomaly
that
undercuts
the
validity
of
applying
rationalist
theory
to
some
wars

Political
science
The
statistical
analysis
of
war
was
pioneered
by
Lewis
Fry
Richardson
following
World
War
I

More
recent
databases
of
wars
and
armed
conflict
have
been
assembled
by
the
Correlates
of
War
Project
Peter
Brecke
and
the
Uppsala
Conflict
Data
Program

The
following
subsections
consider
causes
of
war
from
system
societal
and
individual
levels
of
analysis

This
kind
of
division
was
first
proposed
by
Kenneth
Waltz
in
Man
the
State
and
War
and
has
been
often
used
by
political
scientists
since
then

System
level
There
are
several
different
international
relations
theory
schools

Supporters
of
realism
in
international
relations
argue
that
the
motivation
of
states
is
the
quest
for
security
and
conflicts
can
arise
from
the
inability
to
distinguish
defense
from
offense
which
is
called
the
security
dilemma

Within
the
realist
school
as
represented
by
scholars
such
as
Henry
Kissinger
and
Hans
Morgenthau
and
the
neorealist
school
represented
by
scholars
such
as
Kenneth
Waltz
and
John
Mearsheimer
two
main
sub
theories
are


Balance
of
power
theory
States
have
the
goal
of
preventing
a
single
state
from
becoming
a
hegemon
and
war
is
the
result
of
the
would
be
hegemon
s
persistent
attempts
at
power
acquisition

In
this
view
an
international
system
with
more
equal
distribution
of
power
is
more
stable
and
movements
toward
unipolarity
are
destabilizing

However
evidence
has
shown
power
polarity
is
not
actually
a
major
factor
in
the
occurrence
of
wars



Power
transition
theory
Hegemons
impose
stabilizing
conditions
on
the
world
order
but
they
eventually
decline
and
war
occurs
when
a
declining
hegemon
is
challenged
by
another
rising
power
or
aims
to
preemptively
suppress
them

On
this
view
unlike
for
balance
of
power
theory
wars
become
more
probable
when
power
is
more
equally
distributed

This
power
preponderance
hypothesis
has
empirical
support

The
two
theories
are
not
mutually
exclusive
and
may
be
used
to
explain
disparate
events
according
to
the
circumstance

Liberalism
as
it
relates
to
international
relations
emphasizes
factors
such
as
trade
and
its
role
in
disincentivizing
conflict
which
will
damage
economic
relations

Realists
who
respond
that
military
force
may
sometimes
be
at
least
as
effective
as
trade
at
achieving
economic
benefits
especially
historically
if
not
as
much
today

Furthermore
trade
relations
which
result
in
a
high
level
of
dependency
may
escalate
tensions
and
lead
to
conflict

Empirical
data
on
the
relationship
of
trade
to
peace
are
mixed
and
moreover
some
evidence
suggests
countries
at
war
do
not
necessarily
trade
less
with
each
other

Societal
level
Diversionary
theory
also
known
as
the
scapegoat
hypothesis
suggests
the
politically
powerful
may
use
war
to
as
a
diversion
or
to
rally
domestic
popular
support

This
is
supported
by
literature
showing
out
group
hostility
enhances
in
group
bonding
and
a
significant
domestic
rally
effect
has
been
demonstrated
when
conflicts
begin

However
studies
examining
the
increased
use
of
force
as
a
function
of
need
for
internal
political
support
are
more
mixed

U
S

war
time
presidential
popularity
surveys
taken
during
the
presidencies
of
several
recent
U
S

leaders
have
supported
diversionary
theory

Individual
level
These
theories
suggest
differences
in
people
s
personalities
decision
making
emotions
belief
systems
and
biases
are
important
in
determining
whether
conflicts
get
out
of
hand

For
instance
it
has
been
proposed
that
conflict
is
modulated
by
bounded
rationality
and
various
cognitive
biases
such
as
prospect
theory

Ethics
IMG
Morning
after
the
Battle
of
Waterloo
by
John
Heaviside
Clark
The
morality
of
war
has
been
the
subject
of
debate
for
thousands
of
years

The
two
principal
aspects
of
ethics
in
war
according
to
the
just
war
theory
are
jus
ad
bellum
and
jus
in
bello

Jus
ad
bellum
right
to
war
dictates
which
unfriendly
acts
and
circumstances
justify
a
proper
authority
in
declaring
war
on
another
nation

There
are
six
main
criteria
for
the
declaration
of
a
just
war
first
any
just
war
must
be
declared
by
a
lawful
authority
second
it
must
be
a
just
and
righteous
cause
with
sufficient
gravity
to
merit
large
scale
violence
third
the
just
belligerent
must
have
rightful
intentions
namely
that
they
seek
to
advance
good
and
curtail
evil
fourth
a
just
belligerent
must
have
a
reasonable
chance
of
success
fifth
the
war
must
be
a
last
resort
and
sixth
the
ends
being
sought
must
be
proportional
to
means
being
used

Hitler

Moscow
and
Leningrad
were
to
be
razed
to
the
ground
their
inhabitants
were
to
be
annihilated
or
driven
out
by
starvation

These
intentions
were
part
of
the
General
Plan
East


The
Oxford
Companion
to
World
War
II

Jus
in
bello
right
in
war
is
the
set
of
ethical
rules
when
conducting
war

The
two
main
principles
are
proportionality
and
discrimination

Proportionality
regards
how
much
force
is
necessary
and
morally
appropriate
to
the
ends
being
sought
and
the
injustice
suffered

The
principle
of
discrimination
determines
who
are
the
legitimate
targets
in
a
war
and
specifically
makes
a
separation
between
combatants
who
it
is
permissible
to
kill
and
non
combatants
who
it
is
not

Failure
to
follow
these
rules
can
result
in
the
loss
of
legitimacy
for
the
just
war
belligerent

The
just
war
theory
was
foundational
in
the
creation
of
the
United
Nations
and
in
international
law
s
regulations
on
legitimate
war

Lewis
Coser
an
American
conflict
theorist
and
sociologist
argued
conflict
provides
a
function
and
a
process
whereby
a
succession
of
new
equilibriums
are
created

Thus
the
struggle
of
opposing
forces
rather
than
being
disruptive
may
be
a
means
of
balancing
and
maintaining
a
social
structure
or

crime
against

himself

have
existed
for
every
major
war
in
the
th
century
including
most
prominently
World

I
World
War

and
the
Vietnam
War

In

worldwide
anti

movements
occurred
in
response
to
the
United

invasion
of
Afghanistan
and
Iraq

Protests
opposing
the
War
in
Afghanistan
occurred
in
Europe
Asia
and

Pauses
During
a

brief
pauses
of

may
be
called
for
and
further
agreed
to
ceasefire
temporary
cessation
humanitarian
pauses
and
corridors

arrangements

There
are
a
number
of
disadvantages
obstacles
and
hesitations
against
implementing
such
pauses
such
as
a
humanitarian
corridor

Pauses
in
conflict
can
also
be
ill
advised
for
reasons
such
as
delay
of

and
the
weakening

Notes


The
term
armed
conflict
is
used
instead
of
or
in
addition
to
the
term
war
with
the
former
being
more
general
in
scope

The
International
Committee
of
the
Red
Cross
differentiates
between
international
and
non
international
armed
conflict
in
their
definition
International
armed
conflicts
exist
whenever
there
is
resort
to
armed
force
between
two
or
more
States




Non
international
armed
conflicts
are
protracted
armed
confrontations
occurring
between
governmental
armed
forces
and
the
forces
of
one
or
more
armed
groups
or
between
such
groups
arising
on
the
territory
of
a
State
party
to
the
Geneva
Conventions


The
armed
confrontation
must
reach
a
minimum
level
of
intensity
and
the
parties
involved
in
the
conflict
must
show
a
minimum
of
organisation

first
step

is
to
set
aside
our
abhorrence
of

to
examine
why
it

sometimes
pay
off
in
evolutionary
terms

Natural
selection
is
powered
by
competition
which
means
that
the

of
natural
selection

ArticleVocabulary
War
is
generally
defined
as
violent
conflict
between
states
or
nations

Nations
go
to
war
for
a
variety
of
reasons

It
has
been
argued
that
a
nation
will
go
to
war
if
the
benefits
of
war
are
deemed
to
outweigh
the
disadvantages
and
if
there
is
a
sense
that
there
is
not
another
mutually
agreeable
solution

More
specifically
some
have
argued
that
wars
are
fought
primarily
for
economic
religious
and
political
reasons

Others
have
claimed
that
most
wars
today
are
fought
for
ideological
reasons

In
the
United
States
the
legal
power
to
declare
war
is
vested
in
Congress
however
the
president
is
the
commander
in
chief
of
the
military
so
he
or
she
holds
power
to
conduct
a
war
once
it
has
been
declared

In
many
instances
the
president
has
used
military
force
without
declaring
war

Just
War
Theory
In
Western
tradition
there
is
a
sense
that
the
reasons
for
war
must
be
just

This
idea
dates
back
to
ancient
times
but
is
most
clearly
traced
to
the
writings
of
St

Augustine
and
St

Thomas
Aquinas

They
attempted
to
justify
war
and
reconcile
it
with
the
Christian
belief
that
taking
a
human
life
is
wrong

To
Aquinas
a
war
must
be
just
in
both
the
reasons
for
going
to
war
and
how
war
is
fought

Reasons
for
going
to
war
jus
ad
bellum
are
just
if
war
is
declared
by
an
appropriate
authority
the
war
is
waged
for
a
just
cause
and
the
war
is
waged
for
just
intentions

An
appropriate
authority
is
a
proper
governing
authority

A
just
cause
may
include
self
defense
or
a
response
to
injustice

Just
intentions
mean
that
it
must
not
be
fought
for
self
interest
but
for
justice
or
a
common
good

In
addition
there
must
be
a
reasonable
chance
of
success
the
good
that
will
be
achieved
must
outweigh
the
bad
and
war
must
be
a
last
resort

Once
just
reasons
for
going
to
war
are
satisfied
conduct
in
the
war
jus
in
bello
must
be
just
as
well

Just
conduct
in
a
war
means
that
it
must
be
specific
and
proportional

That
is
noncombatants
and
civilians
must
not
be
deliberately
targeted

Further
only
such
force
as
is
necessary
must
be
used
and
harms
must
be
proportionate
to
the
goal
sought

Law
of
War
Some
of
the
just
war
theories
have
been
adopted
as
parts
of
international
agreements
and
incorporated
into
the
law
of
war
i
e

international
law
that
regulates
the
resort
to
armed
force
the
conduct
of
hostilities
and
the
protection
of
war
victims

The
Geneva
Conventions
for
example
are
a
series
of
international
treaties
that
are
designed
to
protect
noncombatants
civilians
and
prisoners
of
war

The
treaties
were
negotiated
in
Geneva
Switzerland
between
and


The
First
and
Second
Geneva
Conventions
apply
to
sick
and
wounded
soldiers
and
sailors

They
contain
provisions
related
to
protecting
the
wounded
and
sick
as
well
as
medical
personnel
and
transports

The
Third
Geneva
Convention
applies
to
prisoners
of
war
and
the
Fourth
Geneva
Convention
applies
to
people
in
occupied
territories

The
Third
Convention
requires
humane
treatment
of
prisoners
including
adequate
food
and
water

The
Fourth
Convention
includes
provisions
that
forbid
torture
and
the
taking
of
hostages
as
well
as
provisions
related
to
medical
care
and
hospitals

war
in
the
popular

a
conflict
between
political
groups
involving
hostilities
of
considerable
duration
and
magnitude

In
the
usage
of
social
science
certain
qualifications
are
added

Sociologists
usually
apply
the
term
to
such
conflicts
only
if
they
are
initiated
and
conducted
in
accordance
with
socially
recognized
forms

They
treat
war
as
an
institution
recognized
in
custom
or
in
law

Military
writers
usually
confine
the
term
to
hostilities
in
which
the
contending
groups
are
sufficiently
equal
in
power
to
render
the
outcome
uncertain
for
a
time

Armed
conflicts
of
powerful
states
with
isolated
and
powerless
peoples
are
usually
called
pacifications
military
expeditions
or
explorations
with
small
states
they
are
called
interventions
or
reprisals
and
with
internal
groups
rebellions
or
insurrections

Such
incidents
if
the
resistance
is
sufficiently
strong
or
protracted
may

a

The
analysis
of
war
may
be
divided
into
several
categories

Philosophical
political
economic
technological
legal
sociological
and
psychological
approaches
are
frequently
distinguished

These
distinctions
indicate
the
varying
focuses
of
interest
and
the
different
analytical
categories
employed
by
the
theoretician
but
most
of
the
actual
theories
are
mixed
because
war
is
an
extremely
complex
social
phenomenon
that
cannot
be
explained
by
any
single
factor
or
through
any
single
approach

Reflecting
changes
in
the
international
system
theories
of
war
have
passed
through
several
phases
in
the
course
of
the
past
three
centuries

After
the
ending
of
the
wars
of
religion
about
the
middle
of
the
th
century
wars
were
fought
for
the
interests
of
individual
sovereigns
and
were
limited
both
in
their
objectives
and
in
their
scope

The
art
of
maneuver
became
decisive
and
analysis
of
war
was
couched
accordingly
in
terms
of
strategies

The
situation
changed
fundamentally
with
the
outbreak
of
the
French
Revolution
which
increased
the
size
of
forces
from
small
professional
to
large
conscript
armies
and
broadened
the
objectives
of
war
to
the
ideals
of
the
revolution
ideals
that
appealed
to
the
masses
who
were
subject
to
conscription

In
the
relative
order
of
post
Napoleonic
Europe
the
mainstream
of
theory
returned
to
the
idea
of
war
as
a
rational
limited
instrument
of
national
policy

This
approach
was
best
articulated
by
the
Prussian
military
theorist
Carl
von
Clausewitz
in
his
famous
classic
On
War

World
War
I
which
was
total
in
character
because
it
resulted
in
the
mobilization
of
entire
populations
and
economies
for
a
prolonged
period
of
time
did
not
fit
into
the
Clausewitzian
pattern
of
limited
conflict
and
it
led
to
a
renewal
of
other
theories

These
no
longer
regarded
war
as
a
rational
instrument
of
state
policy

The
theorists
held
that
war
in
its
modern
total
form
if
still
conceived
as
a
national
state
instrument
should
be
undertaken
only
if
the
most
vital
interests
of
the
state
touching
upon
its
very
survival
are
concerned

Otherwise
warfare
serves
broad
ideologies
and
not
the
more
narrowly
defined
interests
of
a
sovereign
or
a
nation

Like
the
religious
wars
of
the
th
century
war
becomes
part
of
grand
designs
such
as
the
rising
of
the
proletariat
in
communist
eschatology
or
the
Nazi
doctrine
of
a
master
race

Some
theoreticians
have
gone
even
further
denying
war
any
rational
character
whatsoever

To
them
war
is
a
calamity
and
a
social
disaster
whether
it
is
afflicted
by
one
nation
upon
another
or
conceived
of
as
afflicting
humanity
as
a
whole

The
idea
is
not
new
in
the
aftermath
of
the
Napoleonic
Wars
it
was
articulated
for
example
by
Tolstoy
in
the
concluding
chapter
of
War
and
Peace


In
the
second
half
of
the
th
century
it
gained
new
currency
in
peace
research
a
contemporary
form
of
theorizing
that
combines
analysis
of
the
origins
of
warfare
with
a
strong
normative
element
aiming
at
its
prevention

Peace
research
concentrates
on
two
areas
the
analysis
of
the
international
system
and
the
empirical
study
of
the
phenomenon
of
war

World
War
II
and
the
subsequent
evolution
of
weapons
of
mass
destruction
made
the
task
of
understanding
the
nature
of
war
even
more
urgent

On
the
one
hand
war
had
become
an
intractable
social
phenomenon
the
elimination
of
which
seemed
to
be
an
essential
precondition
for
the
survival
of
mankind

On
the
other
hand
the
use
of
war
as
an
instrument
of
policy
was
calculated
in
an
unprecedented
manner
by
the
nuclear
superpowers
the
United
States
and
the
Soviet
Union

War
also
remained
a
stark
but
rational
instrumentality
in
certain
more
limited
conflicts
such
as
those
between
Israel
and
the
Arab
nations

Thinking
about
war
consequently
became
increasingly
more
differentiated
because
it
had
to
answer
questions
related
to
very
different
types
of
conflict

Clausewitz
cogently
defines
war
as
a
rational
instrument
of
foreign
policy
an
act
of
violence
intended
to
compel
our
opponent
to
fulfill
our
will

Modern
definitions
of
war
such
as
armed
conflict
between
political
units
generally
disregard
the
narrow
legalistic
definitions
characteristic
of
the
th
century
which
limited
the
concept
to
formally
declared
war
between
states

Such
a
definition
includes
civil
wars
but
at
the
same
time
excludes
such
phenomena
as
insurrections
banditry
or
piracy

Finally
war
is
generally
understood
to
embrace
only
armed
conflicts
on
a
fairly
large
scale
usually
excluding
conflicts
in
which
fewer
than
combatants
are
involved

President
Vladimir
Putin
is
not
interested
in
a
limited
territorial
victory
in
Ukraine
and
will
continue
the
war
until
the
final
victory

Borrell
reported
on
December
that
Putin
would
not
be
satisfied
with
capturing
a
piece
of
Ukraine
and
allowing
the
rest
of
Ukraine
to
join
the
EU

Borrell
added
that
Putin
will
not
give
up
the
war
and
called
on
the
West
to
prepare
for
a
conflict
of
high
intensity
for
a
long
time

Borrell
s
statements
are
consistent
with
ISW
s
assessment
that
Russia
is
not
interested
in
a
ceasefire
or
good
faith
negotiations
with
Ukraine
but
retains
its
maximalist
goals
of
a
full
Russian
victory
in
Ukraine

Iran
and
the
Houthis
are
functioning
as
a
coalition
to
conduct
combined
military
operations
targeting
international
shipping
in
the
Red
Sea

Iran
considers
the
Axis
of
Resistance
as
its
unconventional
alliance
of
state
semi
state
and
non
state
actors

Their
anti
US
and
anti
Israeli
ideology
unites
the
Axis
of
Resistance
creating
strategic
alignment
across
its
members

Multiple
US
officials
have
highlighted
the
role
Iran
plays
in
the
targeting
and
execution
of
Houthi
attacks
against
international
shipping

Iran
provides
the
weapons
and
uses
advisers
on
the
ground
in
Yemen
and
at
least
one
spy
ship
anchored
in
the
Red
Sea
to
support
its
Houthi
partners
who
execute
the
attacks
based
on
Iranian
advice
and
intelligence

ISW

Iran
and
its
so
called
Axis
of
Resistance
are
signaling
their
capability
and
willingness
to
attack
maritime
targets
beyond
just
the
Persian
Gulf
and
Red
Sea

A
one
way
drone
struck
a
commercial
vessel
off
the
coast
of
India
causing
structural
damage
to
the
ship
on
December


The
vessel
is
partially
Israeli
owned

Israeli
media
reported
that
Iran
was
responsible
for
the
attack
which
is
consistent
with
the
ongoing
anti
shipping
campaign
that
Iran
and
the
Houthi
movement
have
conducted
around
the
Bab
al
Mandeb
in
recent
weeks

This
attack
follows
the
Islamic
Resistance
of
Iraq
a
coalition
of
Iranian
backed
Iraqi
militias
claiming
on
December
that
it
conducted
an
unspecified
attack
on
a
vital
target
in
the
Mediterranean
Sea

There
is
no
evidence
that
the
Islamic
Resistance
of
Iraq
conducted
an
attack
into
the
Mediterranean
Sea
at
the
time
of
writing

The
claim
nevertheless
signals
the
readiness
of
the
Iraqi
group
to
participate
in
the
Iran
led
attack
campaign
on
maritime
targets

Finally
a
senior
commander
in
Iran
s
Islamic
Revolutionary
Guards
Corps
IRGC
Brigadier
General
Mohammad
Reza
Naghdi
threatened
to
expand
the
anti
shipping
campaign
to
the
Mediterranean
Sea
and
Strait
of
Gibraltar
on
December


Naghdi
frequently
makes
inflammatory
threats
toward
Iranian
adversaries
but
his
statement
is
particularly
noteworthy
given
the
drone
attack
off
the
Indian
coast
and
the
claimed
attack
by
the
Islamic
Resistance
of
Iraq

Iran
and
its
Axis
of
Resistance
are
likely
messaging
their
capability
and
willingness
to
widen
geographically
their
anti
shipping
attack
campaign
in
response
to
the
United
States
forming
a
multinational
naval
task
force
to
safeguard
commercial
traffic
around
the
Red

The
New
York
Times
NYT
citing
former
and
current
senior
Russian
US
and
international
officials
reported
that
Russian
President
Vladimir
Putin
is
using
back
channels
and
intermediaries
to
signal
his
interest
in
a
ceasefire
despite
Putin
s
recent
public
statements
to
the
contrary

NYT
reported
that
Western
officials
have
been
picking
up
renewed
signals
through
backchannels
since
September
that
Putin
is
interested
in
a
ceasefire
that
freezes
the
current
frontlines
but
noted
that
Western
officials
warned
the
backchannels
could
be
Kremlin
misdirection
and
may
not
reflect
a
genuine
willingness
to
negotiate

NYT
suggested
several
possible
motivations
Putin
may
have
for
his
reported
interest
in
a
ceasefire
the
upcoming
March
Russian
presidential
election
a
desire
to
keep
his
options
open
regarding
the
war
s
resolution
and
take
advantage
of
perceived
waning
Western
support
for
Ukraine
and
the
distraction
of
the
Israel
Hamas
war

All
these
motivations
reflect
temporary
reasons
why
Putin
might
pursue
a
temporary
ceasefire
that
would
benefit
Russia
by
allowing
Russia
the
time
to
prepare
for
renewed
aggression
against
Ukraine
as
ISW
has
routinely
assessed

The
NYT
noted
that
Putin
s
public
rhetoric
which
has
recently
reasserted
Russia
s
maximalist
objectives
that
are
tantamount
to
full
Ukrainian
and
Western
surrender
is
at
odds
with
Putin
s
reported
private
desire
to
declare
victory
and
move
on

Neither
the
NYT
nor
its
sources
offered
any
reason
to
believe
Putin
s
backchannel
communications
would
be
more
reflective
of
his
goals
than
his
public
speeches
addressing
domestic
Ukrainian
and
international
audiences

The
NYT
report
also
failed
to
make
clear
whether
Putin
s
alleged
interest
in
a
ceasefire
is
for
a
temporary
pause
or
a
permanent
end
to
the
war

Allowing
Russia
to
win
its
war
in
Ukraine
would
be
a
self
imposed
strategic
defeat
for
the
United
States

The
United
States
would
face
the
risk
of
a
larger
and
costlier
war
in
Europe

The
United
States
would
face
the
worst
threat
from
Russia
since
the
collapse
of
the
Soviet
Union
as
a
victorious
Russia
would
likely
emerge
reconstituted
and
more
determined
to
undermine
the
United
States
and
confident
that
it
can

A
Russian
victory
would
diminish
America
s
deterrence
around
the
world
emboldening
others
with
an
explicit
or
latent
intent
to
harm
the
United
States

A
Russian
victory
would
create
an
ugly
world
in
which
the
atrocities
associated
with
Russia
s
way
of
war
and
way
of

are
normalized

Most
dangerous

would
learn

of

The
Russo
Ukrainian
War
c
is
an
ongoing
international
conflict
between
Russia
and
Ukraine
which
began
in
February


d
Following
Ukraine
s
Revolution
of
Dignity
Russia
annexed
Crimea
from
Ukraine
and
supported
pro
Russian
separatists
fighting
the
Ukrainian
military
in
the
Donbas
war

The
first
eight
years
of
conflict
also
included
naval
incidents
cyberwarfare
and
heightened
political
tensions

In
February
Russia
launched
a
full
scale
invasion
of
Ukraine
and
began
occupying
more
of
the
country

In
early
the
Euromaidan
protests
led
to
the
Revolution
of
Dignity
and
the
ousting
of
Ukraine
s
pro
Russian
president
Viktor
Yanukovych

Shortly
after
pro
Russian
unrest
erupted
in
eastern
and
southern
Ukraine

Simultaneously
unmarked
Russian
troops
moved
into
Ukraine
s
Crimea
and
took
over
government
buildings
strategic
sites
and
infrastructure

Russia
soon
annexed
Crimea
after
a
highly
disputed
referendum

In
April
Russian
backed
separatist
forces
seized
government
buildings
in
Ukraine
s
eastern
Donbas
region
and
proclaimed
the
Donetsk
People
s
Republic
DPR
and
the
Luhansk
People
s
Republic
LPR
as
independent
states
starting
the
Donbas
war

The
separatists
received
considerable
but
covert
support
from
Russia
and
Ukrainian
attempts
to
fully
retake
separatist
held
areas
failed

Although
Russia
denied
involvement
Russian
troops
took
part
in
the
fighting

In
February
Russia
and
Ukraine
signed
the
Minsk
II
agreements
to
end
the
conflict
but
they
were
never
fully
implemented
in
the
years
that
followed

The
Donbas
war
settled
into
a
violent
but
static
conflict
between
Ukraine
and
the
Russian
and
separatist
forces
with
many
brief
ceasefires
but
no
lasting
peace
and
few
changes
in
territorial
control

Beginning
in
Russia
built
up
a
large
military
presence
near
its
border
with
Ukraine
including
within
neighbouring
Belarus

Russian
officials
repeatedly
denied
plans
to
attack
Ukraine

Russian
president
Vladimir
Putin
criticized
the
enlargement
of
NATO
and
demanded
that
Ukraine
be
barred
from
ever
joining
the
military
alliance

He
also
expressed
irredentist
views
and
questioned
Ukraine
s
right
to
exist

Russia
recognized
the
DPR
and
LPR
as
independent
states
in
February


Putin
announced
a
special
military
operation
to
demilitarize
and
denazify
Ukraine
claiming
Russia
had
no
plans
to
occupy
the
country

Russian
forces
invaded
Ukraine

The
invasion
was
internationally
condemned
many
countries
imposed
sanctions
against
Russia

The
Ukrainian
presidential
election
was
controversial

During
the
election
campaign
opposition
candidate
Viktor
Yushchenko
was
poisoned
by
TCDD

he
later
accused
Russia
of
involvement

In
November
Prime
Minister
Viktor
Yanukovych
was
declared
the

despite
allegations
of

rigging
by

observers

During
a
two
month
period
which
became
known
as
the
Orange
Revolution
large
peaceful
protests
successfully
challenged
the
outcome

After
the
Supreme
Court
of
Ukraine
annulled
the
initial
result
due
to
widespread
electoral
fraud
a
second
round

was
held
bringing

Yushchenko
as
president
and
Yulia
Tymoshenko
as

and
leaving
Yanukovych
in

The
Orange
Revolution
is
often
grouped
together
with
other
early
st
century
protest
movements
particularly
within
the
former
USSR
known
as
colour
revolutions

According
to
Anthony
Cordesman
Russian
military
officers
viewed
such
colour
revolutions
as
attempts
by
the
US
and
European
states
to
destabilise
neighbouring
countries
and
undermine
Russia
s
national
security

Russian
President
Vladimir
Putin
accused
organisers
of
the
Russian
protests
of
being
former
advisors
to
Yushchenko
and
described
the
protests
as
an
attempt
to
transfer
the
Orange
Revolution
to
Russia

Rallies
in

of
Putin
during
this
period
were
called
anti
Orange
protests


At
the
Bucharest
summit
Ukraine

sought

response
among
NATO

was
divided
Western
European

opposed
offering
Membership
Action
Plans
MAP
in
order
to
avoid
antagonising
Russia
while
US
President
George
W

Bush
pushed
for
their
admission

NATO
ultimately
refused
to
offer
Ukraine

Georgia
MAPs
but
also
issued
a
statement
agreeing
that
these
countries
will
become
members
of

at

Putin
voiced
strong
opposition
to
Georgia
and
Ukraine

By

the
possibility
of
Ukraine
joining

remained
remote

In

announced

on

Yanukovych
and
the
leaders
of

The
following
day
Yanukovych
fled
from

ahead
of
an

vote
that
stripped
him
of
his
powers
as
president

On
February
the
Rada
adopted
a
bill
to
repeal
the
law
which
gave
the
Russian
language
an
official
status

The
bill
was
not
enacted
however
the
proposal
provoked
negative
reactions
in
the
Russian
speaking
regions
of
Ukraine
intensified
by
Russian
media
saying
that
the
ethnic
Russian
population
was
in
imminent
danger

On
February
an
interim

was
established
and
early

were
scheduled

The
following
day
Yanukovych
resurfaced
in

and
in

declared
that

At

Russia
had
roughly
military

in

in
several
locations
in
the
Crimean
peninsula
like

lighthouse
near
Yalta
and
a
number
of
other
beacons

Russian
presence
was
allowed
by
the
basing

agreement
with
Ukraine

Under
the
agreements
the
Russian
military
in

was
constrained
to
a
maximum
of

they
were
required
to
respect
the

and
show
their

under

plausible
guise
of
security
concerns
deploy
special

pro
Russian
unrest
in
Ukraine
From
late
February
demonstrations
by
pro
Russian
and
anti
government
groups
took
place
in
major
cities
across
the
eastern
and
southern
regions
of
Ukraine

The
first
protests
across
southern
and
eastern
Ukraine
were
largely
native
expressions
of
discontent
with
the
new
Ukrainian
government

Russian
involvement
at
this
stage
was
limited
to
voicing
support
for
the
demonstrations

Russia
exploited
this
however
launching
a
coordinated
political
and
military
campaign
against
Ukraine

Putin
gave
legitimacy
to
the
separatists
when
he
described
the
Donbas
as
part
of
New
Russia
Novorossiya
and
expressed
bewilderment
as
to
how
the
region
had
ever
become
part
of
Ukraine

Russia
continued
to
marshal
forces
near
Ukraine
s
eastern
border
in
late
March
reaching
troops
by
April

The
deployment
was
used
to
threaten
escalation
and
disrupt
Ukraine
s
response

This
threat
forced
Ukraine
to
divert
forces
to
its
borders
instead
of
the
conflict
zone

Ukrainian
authorities
cracked
down
on
the
pro
Russian
protests
and
arrested
local
separatist
leaders
in
early
March

Those
leaders
were
replaced
by
people
with
ties
to
the
Russian
security
services
and
interests
in
Russian
businesses

By
April
Russian
citizens
had
taken
control
of
the
separatist
movement
supported
by
volunteers
and
materiel
from
Russia
including
Chechen
and
Cossack
fighters

According
to
Donetsk
People
s
Republic
DPR
commander
Igor
Girkin
without
this
support
in
April
the
movement
would
have
dissipated
as
it
had
in
Kharkiv
and
Odesa

The
separatist
groups
held
disputed
referendums
in
May
which
were
not

In
April
armed
conflict
began
in
eastern
Ukraine
between
Russian
backed
separatist
forces
and
Ukraine

The
separatists
declared
the
People
s
Republics
of
Donetsk
and
Luhansk

From
April
militants
occupied
government
buildings
in
many
cities
and
took
control
of
border
crossings
to
Russia
transport
hubs
a
broadcasting
center
and
other
strategic
infrastructure

On
April
several
armed
groups
took
cities
of
Sloviansk
Kramatorsk
and
then
Horlivka
Druzhkivka
in
subsequent
days

They
were
led
by
people
like
retired
Russian
colonel
Igor
Girkin
and
lieutenant
colonel
Igor
Bezler

Faced
with
continued
expansion
of
separatist
territorial
control
on
April
the
interim
Ukrainian
government
launched
an
Anti
Terrorist
Operation
ATO
however
Ukrainian
forces
were
poorly
prepared
and
ill
positioned
and
the
operation
quickly
stalled

By
the
end
of
April
Ukraine
announced
it
had
lost
control
of
the
provinces
of
Donetsk
and
Luhansk

It
claimed
to
be
on
full
combat
alert
against
a
possible
Russian
invasion
and
reinstated
conscription
to
its
armed
forces

Through
May
the
Ukrainian
campaign
focused
on
containing
the
separatists
by
securing
key
positions
around
the
ATO
zone
to
position
the
military
for
a
decisive
offensive
once
Ukraine
s
national
mobilization
had
completed

As
conflict
between
the
separatists
and
the
Ukrainian
government
escalated
in
May
Russia
began
to
employ
a
hybrid
approach
combining
disinformation
tactics
irregular
fighters
regular
Russian
troops
and
conventional
military
support

The
First
Battle
of
Donetsk
Airport
followed
the
Ukrainian
presidential
elections

It
marked
a
turning
point
in
conflict
it
was
the
first
battle
between
the
separatists
and
the
Ukrainian
government
that
involved
large
numbers
of
Russian
volunteers


According
to
Ukraine
at
the
height
of
the
conflict
in
the
summer
of
Russian
paramilitaries
made
up
between
and
of
the
combatants

On
July
Russian
controlled
forces
shot
down
a
passenger
aircraft
Malaysia

as
it
was
flying
over
eastern
Ukraine

Investigations
and
the
recovery
of
bodies
began
in
the
conflict
zone
as
fighting
continued

By
the
end
of
July
Ukrainian
forces
were
pushing
into
cities
to
cut
off
supply
routes
between
the
two
isolating
Donetsk
and
attempting
to
restore
control
of
the
Russo
Ukrainian

By
July
the
strategic
heights
of
Savur
Mohyla
were
under
Ukrainian
control
along
with
the
town
of
Debaltseve
an
important
railroad

These
operational
successes
of

threatened

for

Russia
dispatched
what
it
called
a

convoy
of

across

in

Ukraine
called
the

a

reported

almost
daily
in

up

that

Strelkov
claimed
that
in
early
August
Russian
servicemen
supposedly
on
vacation
from
the
army
began
to
arrive
in
Donbas

By
August
the
Ukrainian
Anti
Terrorist
Operation
shrank
the
territory
under
pro
Russian
control
and
approached
the
border

Igor
Girkin
urged
Russian
military
intervention
and
said
that
the
combat
inexperience
of
his
irregular
forces
along
with
recruitment
difficulties
amongst
the
local
population
had
caused
the
setbacks

He
stated
Losing
this
war
on

that
President
Vladimir
Putin
personally
named
New
Russia
would
threaten
the
Kremlin
s
power
and
personally
the
power
of

In
response
to
the
deteriorating
situation
Russia
abandoned
its
hybrid
approach
and
began
a
conventional
invasion
on
August


On
the
following
day
the
Russian

said
these

of

changes
in
territorial

The
conflict
was
marked
by
artillery

operations
and
trench
warfare

Hostilities
never
ceased
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
but
continued
at
a
low
level
despite
repeated
attempts
at

In

minor
skirmishes
continued
along

Both
sides
began
fortifying
their
position
by
building
networks
of
trenches

The
relatively
static
conflict
was
labelled

worked

The
organisation
recruited
mostly
army
veterans

also

with
military
experience

The
cost
of
equipping
one

was
estimated

per
month

The

received

Fighting
in

escalated

There

sharp
increase
in
artillery
shelling
by
the
Russian

militants
in
Donbas
which
was
considered
by
Ukraine
and
its
supporters
to
be
an
attempt
to
provoke
the
Ukrainian
army
or
create
a
pretext
for
invasion

evacuations
of
civilians
from

announced
a
special
military
operation
to
demilitarise
and
denazify
Ukraine

Minutes
later
missiles
and
airstrikes
hit
across
Ukraine
including
Kyiv
shortly
followed
by

declared
martial
law
and
a
general
mobilisation
of
all
male
Ukrainian
citizens
between

who
were
banned
from
leaving

country

Russian
attacks
were
initially
launched

Belarus
towards
Kyiv
a
southern
front
from
Crimea
and
a

northern
front
amidst
heavy
losses
and
strong
Ukrainian
resistance
surrounding
Kyiv
Russia

advance
stalled
in
March
and
by
April

retreated

On
April
Russia
placed
its
forces
in
southern
and
eastern
Ukraine
under
the
command
of
General
Aleksandr
Dvornikov
and
some
units
withdrawn
from
the
north
were
redeployed
to
the
Donbas

On
April
Russia
launched
a
renewed
attack
across
a
kilometres
mi
long
front
extending
from
Kharkiv
to
Donetsk
and
Luhansk

By

The
initial
reaction
to
the
escalation
of
tensions
in
Crimea
caused
the
Russian
and
European
stock
market
to
tumble

The
intervention
caused
the

franc
to

to
a
year

against

and
year
high

The

and

Prices
for

Later
in
March
the
reaction
of
the
financial
markets
to
the
Crimea
annexation
was
surprisingly
mellow
with
global
financial
markets
rising
immediately
after
the
referendum
held
in
Crimea
one
explanation
being
that
the
sanctions
were
already
priced
in
following
the
earlier
Russian
incursion

Other
observers
considered
that
the
positive
reaction
of
the
global
financial
markets
on
Monday
March
after
the
announcement
of
sanctions
against
Russia
by
the
EU
and
the
US
revealed
that
these
sanctions
were
too
weak
to
hurt
Russia

In

August
the

found
that

either

with

should
be

roughly

that
approximately
of
the
Russians
polled
supported
the
special
military
operation
in
Ukraine
suggesting
that
Russian
public
opinion
has
shifted
considerably
since


According
to
some
sources
a
reason
many
Russians
supported
the
special
military
operation
has
to
do
with
the
propaganda
and
disinformation

In
addition
it
has
been
suggested
that
some
respondents
did
not
want
to
answer
pollsters
questions
for
fear
of
negative
consequences

At

a

Center
concluded
the
following
When
asked
why
they
think
the
military
operation
is
taking
place
respondents
said
it
was
to

The

Republic
and
the
Luhansk
People
s
Republic
were
Russian
controlled
puppet
states
that
declared
their
independence
from

in
May


In
they
received
international
recognition
from
each
other
Russia
Syria
and
North
Korea
and
some
other
partially
recognised
states

On
September
Russia
declared
it
had
formally
annexed
both
entities



There
remain
some
contradictions
and
inherent
problems
regarding
the
date
on
which
the
annexation
began

Ukraine
claims
February
as
the
beginning
of
the
temporary
occupation
of
Crimea
and
Sevastopol
by
Russia
citing
the

parliament
officially
designated
the
date

Konstantinov
who
at
that
time
was
a
chairman
of
the
republican
council
of
Crimea
and
representing
the
Party
of
Regions
expressed
his
thoughts
about
secession
of
the
region
from
Ukraine

On
February
the
Russian
ambassador
to
Ukraine
Mikhail
Zurabov
was
recalled
to
Moscow
due
to
a
worsening
of
the
situation
in
Ukraine


In
early
March
President
Putin
stated
in
a
Russian
movie
about
the
annexation
of
Crimea
that
he
ordered
the
operation
to
restore
Crimea
to
Russia
following
an
all
night
emergency
meeting
on
February
and
in
the
Russian
Foreign
Minister
claimed
that
the
earlier
start
date
on
the
medal
was
due
to
a
technical
misunderstanding

Lessons

s
Operations

page
published
by

Corporation
in


Ukraine
s
government
was
in
transition
following
the
ouster
of
Yanukovych

As
a
result
it
did
not
react
to
the
Russian
operation
when
launched

Russia
s
task
was
made
relatively
easy
by
the
confusion
and
chaos
that
generally
follows
an
uprising
such
as
what
happened
in
Kyiv

Moscow
capitalized
on
the
tensions
and
uncertainty
in
Crimea
as
well
as
on
the
inexperience
of
Ukraine
s
provisional
government

Meeting
notes
of
the
discussion
among
Ukrainian
leadership
reveal
a
great
deal
of
anxiety
uncertainty
and
unwillingness
to
take
action
for
fear
of
escalation

I
will
only
say
the
following
About
two
to
three
months
ago
I
was
giving
an
interview
to
one
of
the
media
I
don
t
remember
which
specific
one

I
answered
them
back
then
that
anywhere
across
the
world
we
will
be
seeking
and
hunting
down
Russian
military
criminals
and
sooner
or
later
that
time
will
come
whenever
they
are

That
is
why
we
shouldn
t
be
surprised
when
in
any
territory
something
happens
to
Russian
military
criminals

Then
speaking
about
your
specific
question
about
Sudan
regretfully
I
cannot
confirm
or
deny

In

I
have
to
remind
the
Council
that
the
official
medal
that
was
produced
by
the
Russian
Federation
for
the
so
called
return
of
Crimea
has
the
dates
on

with
February
which
is
the
day
before
that
agreement
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
Security
Council
by
the
representative
of
the
Russian
Federation

Therefore
the
Russian
Federation
started
not
just
planned
but
started
the
annexation
of
Crimea
the
day
before
we
reached
the
first
agreement
and
while
President
Yanukovych
was
still
in
power

The
Israeli
Palestinian
conflict
is
an
ongoing
military
and
political
conflict
in
the
Levant

Beginning
in
the
mid
th
century
it
is
one
of
the
world
s
longest
continuing
conflicts

Various
attempts
have

made
to

Mandate

obligation
for
the
establishment

of
a
national
home
for
the
Jewish
people


Tensions
grew
into
open
sectarian
conflict
between
Jews
and
Arabs

The
United
Nations
Partition
Plan
for
Palestine
was
never
implemented
and
provoked
the
Palestine
War

The
violence
of
the
conflict
in
the
region
rich
in
sites
of
historic
cultural
and
religious
interest
worldwide
has
been
the
subject
of
numerous
international
conferences
dealing
with
historic
rights
security
issues
and
human
rights
and
has
been
a
factor
limiting
access
to
and
tourism
in
areas
that
are
highly
contested

The
majority
of
peace
efforts
have
been
centred
around
the
two
state
solution
which
involves
the
establishment
of
an
independent
Palestinian
state
alongside
Israel

Public
support
for
a
two
state
solution
which
formerly
enjoyed
support
from
both
Israeli
Jews
and
Palestinians
has
dwindled
in
recent
years

Within
Israeli
and
Palestinian
society
the
conflict
generates
a
wide
variety
of
views
and
opinions
including
that
the
violence
perpetrated
by
the
Israelis
against
the
Palestinians
is
part
of
a
genocide
and
that
Palestinians
use
worldwide
terrorism
to
promote
their
interests

Since
its
inception
the
conflict
s
casualties
have
not
been
restricted
to
combatants
with
a
large
number
of
civilian
fatalities
on
both
sides

A
minority
of
Jewish
Israelis
percent
support
a
two
state
solution
with
the
Palestinians

Israeli
Jews
are
divided
along
ideological
lines
and
many
favor
maintaining
the
status
quo

Approximately
percent
of
Palestinians
in
the
Gaza
Strip
and
in
the
West
Bank
support
armed
attacks
against
Israelis
within
Israel
as
a
means
of
ending
the
occupation
while
believe
that
a
two
state
solution
is
no
longer
practical
or
possible
as
a
result
of
the
expansion
of
Israeli
settlements

More
than
two
thirds
of
Israeli
Jews
say
that
if
the
West
Bank
were
annexed
by
Israel
Palestinians
resident
there
should
not
be
permitted
to
vote

Mutual
distrust
and
significant
disagreements
are
deep
over
basic
issues
as
is
the
reciprocal
skepticism
about
the
other
side
s
commitment
to
upholding
obligations
in
an
eventual
bilateral
agreement

Since
the
Palestinian
side
has
been
fractured
by
conflict
between
Fatah
the
traditionally
dominant
party
and
its
later
electoral
challenger
Hamas
a
militant
Islamist
group
that
gained
control
of
the
Gaza
Strip

Attempts
to
remedy
this
have
been
repeated
and
continuing

Since
the
Israeli
side
has
also
been
experiencing
political
upheaval
with
four
inconclusive
legislative
elections
having
been
held
over
a
span
of
two
years

The
latest
round
of
peace
negotiations
began
in
July
but
were
suspended
in


Since
Hamas
and
Israel
have
fought
five
wars

most

The
two
parties
that
engage
in
direct
negotiation
are
the
Israeli
government
and
the
Palestine
Liberation
Organization
PLO


Official
negotiations
are
mediated
by
the
Quartet
on
the
Middle
East
which
consists
of
the
United
Nations
the
United
States
Russia
and
the
European
Union

The
Arab
League
which
has
proposed
the
Arab
Peace
Initiative
is
another
important
actor

in
the
Arab
Israeli
conflict
and

so
since

Another
key
participant
is

The
Israeli
Palestinian
conflict
has
its
roots
in
the
late
th
and
early
th
centuries
with
the
birth
of
major
nationalist
movements
among
the
Jews
and
among
the
Arabs
both
geared
towards
attaining
sovereignty
for
their
people
in
the
Middle
East

The
Balfour
Declaration
was
a
public
statement
issued
by
the
British
government
in
during
the
First
World
War
announcing
support
for
the
establishment
of
a
national
home
for
the
Jewish
people
in
Palestine

The
collision
between
those
two
movements
in
southern
Levant
upon
the
emergence
of
Palestinian
nationalism
after
the
Franco
Syrian
War
in
the
s
escalated
into
the
Sectarian
conflict
in
Mandatory
Palestine
in
s
and
s
and
expanded
into
the
wider
Arab
Israeli
conflict
later
on

The
return
of
several
hard
line
Palestinian
Arab
nationalists
under
the
emerging
leadership
of
Haj
Amin
al
Husseini
from
Damascus
to
Mandatory
Palestine
marked
the
beginning
of
Palestinian
Arab
nationalist
struggle
towards
establishment
of
a
national
home
for
Arabs
of
Palestine

Amin
al
Husseini
the
architect
of
the
Palestinian
Arab
national
movement
immediately
marked
Jewish
national
movement
and
Jewish
immigration
to
Palestine
as
the
sole
enemy
to
his
cause
initiating
large
scale
riots
against
the
Jews
as
early
as
in
Jerusalem
and
in
in
Jaffa

Among
the
results
of
the
violence
was
the
establishment
of
the
Jewish
paramilitary
force
Haganah

In
a
series
of
violent
riots
resulted
in
the
deaths
of
Jews
and
Arabs
with
significant
Jewish
casualties
in
Hebron
and
Safed
and
the
evacuation
of
Jews
from
Hebron
and

Mandatory

In
the
early
s
the
Arab
national
struggle
in
Palestine
had
drawn
many
Arab
nationalist
militants
from
across
the
Middle
East
such
as
Sheikh
Izaddin
al
Qassam
from
Syria
who
established
the
Black
Hand
militant
group
and
had
prepared
the
grounds
for
the
Arab
revolt
in
Palestine

Following
the
death
of
al
Qassam
at
the
hands
of
the
British
in
late
tensions
erupted
in
into
the
Arab
general
strike
and
general
boycott

The
strike
soon
deteriorated
into
violence
and
the
Arab
revolt
was
bloodily
repressed
by
the
British
assisted
by
associated
forces
of
the
Jewish
Settlement
Police
the
Jewish
Supernumerary
Police
and
Special
Night
Squads

In
the
first
wave
of
organized
violence
lasting
until
early
most
of
the
Arab
groups
were
defeated
by
the
British
and
forced
expulsion
of
much
of
the
Arab
leadership
ensued

The
revolt
led
to
the
establishment
of
the
Peel
Commission
towards
partitioning
of
Palestine
though
it
was
subsequently
rejected
by
the
Palestinian
Arabs

The
two
main
Jewish
leaders
Chaim
Weizmann
and
David
Ben
Gurion
accepted
the
recommendations
but
some
secondary
Jewish
leaders
disapproved
of
it

The
renewed
violence
which
continued
sporadically
until
the
beginning
of
World
War
II
ended
with
around
casualties
mostly
from
the
Arab
side

With
the
eruption
of
World
War
II
the
situation
in
Mandatory
Palestine
calmed
down

It
allowed
a
shift
towards
a
more
moderate
stance
among
Palestinian
Arabs
under
the
leadership
of
the
Nashashibi
clan
and
even
the
establishment
of
the
Jewish
Arab
Palestine
Regiment
under
British
command
fighting
Germans
in
North
Africa

The
more
radical
exiled
faction
of
al
Husseini
however
tended
to
cooperate
with
Nazi
Germany
and
participated
in
the
establishment
of
a
pro
Nazi
propaganda
machine
throughout
the
Arab
world

The
defeat
of
Arab
nationalists
in
Iraq
and
subsequent
relocation
of
al
Husseini
to
Nazi
occupied
Europe
tied
his
hands
regarding
field
operations
in
Palestine
though
he
regularly
demanded
that
the
Italians
and
the
Germans
bomb
Tel
Aviv

By
the
end
of
World
War
II
a
crisis
over
the
fate
of
the
Holocaust
survivors
from
Europe
led
to
renewed
tensions
between
the
Yishuv
and
the
Palestinian
Arab
leadership

Immigration
quotas
were
established
by
the
British
while
on
the
other
hand
illegal
immigration
and
Zionist
insurgency
against
the
British
was
increasing

On
November
the
General
Assembly
of
the
United
Nations
adopted
Resolution
II
recommending
the
adoption
and
implementation
of
a
plan
to
partition
Palestine
into
an
Arab
state
a
Jewish
state
and
the
City
of
Jerusalem

On
the
next
day
Palestine
was
swept
by
violence

For
four
months
under
continuous
Arab
provocation
and
attack
the
Yishuv
was
usually
on
the
defensive
while
occasionally
retaliating

The
Arab
League
supported
the
Arab
struggle
by
forming
the
volunteer
based
Arab
Liberation
Army
supporting
the
Palestinian
Arab
Army
of
the
Holy
War
under
the
leadership
of
Abd
al
Qadir
al
Husayni
and
Hasan
Salama

On
the
Jewish
side
the
civil
war
was
managed
by
the
major
underground
militias
the
Haganah
Irgun
and
Lehi
strengthened
by
numerous
Jewish
veterans
of
World
War
II
and
foreign
volunteers

By
spring
it
was
already
clear
that
the
Arab
forces
were
nearing
a
total
collapse
while
Yishuv
forces
gained
more
and
more
territory

on

In
Israeli
officials
led
by
Yitzhak
Rabin
and
Palestinian
leaders
from
the
Palestine
Liberation
Organization
led
by
Yasser
Arafat
strove
to
find
a
peaceful
solution
through
what
became
known
as
the
Oslo
peace
process

A
crucial
milestone
in
this
process
was
Arafat
s
letter
of
recognition
of
Israel
s
right
to
exist

In
the
Oslo
Accords
were
finalized
as
a
framework
for
future
Israeli
Palestinian
relations

The
crux
of
the
Oslo
agreement
was
that
Israel
would
gradually
cede
control
of
the
Palestinian
territories
over
to
the
Palestinians
in
exchange
for
peace

The
Oslo
process
was
delicate
and
progressed
in
fits
and
starts

The
process
took
a
turning
point
at
the
assassination
of
Yitzhak
Rabin
in
November
and
finally
unraveled
when
Arafat
and
Ehud
Barak
failed
to
reach
an
agreement
at
Camp
David
in
July


Robert
Malley
special
assistant
to
US
President
Bill
Clinton
for
Arab
Israeli
Affairs
has
confirmed
that
while
Barak
made
no
formal
written
offer
to
Arafat
the
US
did
present
concepts
for
peace
which
were
considered
by
the
Israeli
side
yet
left
unanswered
by
Arafat
the
Palestinians
principal
failing
is
that
from
the
beginning
of
the
Camp
David
summit
onward
they
were
unable
either
to
say
yes
to
the
American
ideas
or
to
present
a
cogent
and
specific
counterproposal
of
their
own


Consequently
there
are
different
accounts
of

considered

In

US
President
Bill
Clinton
convened
a
peace
summit
between
Palestinian
President
Yasser
Arafat
and
Israeli
Prime
Minister
Ehud
Barak

Barak
reportedly
put
forward
the
following
as
bases
for
negotiation
via
the
US
to
the
Palestinian
President
a
non
militarized
Palestinian
state
split
into
parts
containing
en
of
the
West
Bank
including
only
parts
of
East
Jerusalem
and
the
entire
Gaza
Strip
as
well
as
a
stipulation
that
Jewish
settlements
which
comprise
of
the
West
Bank
s
Jewish
settlers
would
be
ceded
to
Israel
no
right
of
return
to
Israel
no
sovereignty
over
the
Temple
Mount
or
any
core
East
Jerusalem
neighbourhoods
and
continued
Israel
control
over
the
Jordan
Valley

Arafat
rejected
this
offer

According
to
the
Palestinian
negotiators
the
offer
did
not
remove
many
of
the
elements
of
the
Israeli
occupation
regarding
land
security
settlements
and
Jerusalem

President
Clinton
reportedly
requested
that
Arafat
make
a
counter
offer
but
he
proposed
none

Former
Israeli
Foreign
Minister
Shlomo
Ben
Ami
who
kept
a
diary
of
the
negotiations
said
in
an
interview
in
when
asked
whether
the
Palestinians
made
a
counterproposal
No

And
that
is
the
heart
of
the
matter

Never
in
the
negotiations
between
us
and
the
Palestinians
was
there
a
Palestinian
counterproposal

In
a
separate
interview
in
Ben
Ami
stated
that
were
he
a
Palestinian
he
would
have
rejected
the
Camp
David
offer

No
tenable
solution
was
crafted
which
would
satisfy
both
Israeli
and
Palestinian
demands
even
under
intense
US
pressure

Clinton
has
long
blamed
Arafat
for
the
collapse
of
the
summit

In
the
months
following
the
summit
Clinton
appointed
former
US
Senator
George
J

Mitchell
to
lead
a
fact
finding
committee
aiming
to
identify
strategies
for
restoring
the
peace
process

The
committee
s
findings
were
published
in
with
the
dismantlement
of
existing
Israeli
settlements
and
Palestinian
crackdown
on
militant
activity
being
one
strategy

Following

summit
Palestinian
and
Israeli
negotiators
continued
to
meet
in
small
groups
through
August
and
September
to
try
to
bridge
the
gaps
between
their
respective
positions

The
United
States
prepared
its
own
plan
to
resolve
the
outstanding
issues

Clinton
s
presentation
of
the
US
proposals
was
delayed
by
the
advent
of
the
Second
Intifada
at
the
end
of
September

Clinton
s
plan
eventually
presented
on
December
proposed
the
establishment
of
a
sovereign
Palestinian
state
in
the
Gaza
strip
and
percent
of
the
West
Bank
plus
the
equivalent
of
percent
of
the
West
Bank
in
land
swaps
from
pre
Israel

On
Jerusalem
the
plan
stated
that
the
general
principle
is
that
Arab
areas
are
Palestinian
and
that
Jewish
areas
are
Israeli

The
holy
sites
were
to
be
split
on
the
basis
that
Palestinians
would
have
sovereignty
over
the
Temple
Mount
Noble
sanctuary
while
the
Israelis
would
have
sovereignty
over
the
Western
Wall

On
refugees
the
plan
suggested
a
number
of
proposals
including
financial
compensation
the
right
of
return
to
the
Palestinian
state
and
Israeli
acknowledgment
of
suffering
caused
to
the
Palestinians
in


Security
proposals
referred
to
a
non
militarized
Palestinian
state
and
an
international
force
for

security

Both
sides
accepted
Clinton
s
plan
and
it
became
the
basis
for
the
negotiations
at
the
Taba

summit
the

The
proposition
removed
the
temporarily
Israeli
controlled
areas
and
the
Palestinian
side
accepted
this
as
a
basis
for
further
negotiation

With
Israeli
elections
looming
the
talks
ended
without
an
agreement
but
the
two
sides
issued
a
joint
statement
attesting
to
the
progress

had
made
The
sides
declare
that
they
have
never

and
it
is
thus
our
shared
belief
that
the
remaining
gaps
could
be
bridged
with
the
resumption
of

following

Peace
Initiative
Arabic
Mub

yyah
also
known
as
the
Saudi
Initiative
was
first
proposed
by
Crown
Prince
Abdullah
of
Saudi
Arabia
at
the
Beirut
Summit


The
peace
initiative
is
a
proposed
solution
to
the
Arab
Israeli
conflict
as
a
whole
and
the
Israeli
Palestinian
conflict
in
particular

The
initiative
was
initially
published
on
March
at
the
Beirut
Summit
and
agreed
upon
again
in
in
the
Riyadh
Summit

Unlike
the

Map
for
Peace
it
spelled
out
final
solution
borders
based
explicitly
on
the
UN
borders
established
before
the
Six
Day
War

It
offered
full
normalization
of
relations
with
Israel
in
exchange
for
the
withdrawal
of
its
forces
from
all
the
occupied
territories
including
the
Golan
Heights
to
recognize
an
independent
Palestinian
state
with
East
Jerusalem
as
its
capital
in
the
West
Bank
and
Gaza
Strip
as
well
as
a
just
solution
for
the
Palestinian
refugees

The
Palestinian
Authority
led
by
Yasser
Arafat
immediately
embraced
the
initiative

His
successor
Mahmoud
Abbas
also
supported
the
plan
and
officially
asked
U

Barack
Obama
to
adopt
it
as
part
of
his
Middle

policy

Islamist
political
party
Hamas
the
elected
government
of
the
Gaza

was
deeply
divided

factions
rejecting
the
plan

Palestinians
have
criticised
the
Israel
United
Arab
Emirates
normalization
agreement
and
another
with
Bahrain
signed
in
September
fearing
the
moves
weaken
the
Arab
Peace
Initiative
regarding
the
UAE
s
move
as
a
betrayal

The
Israeli
government
under
Ariel
Sharon
rejected
the
initiative
as
a
non
starter
because
it
required
Israel
to
withdraw
to
pre
June
borders

After
the
renewed
Arab
League
endorsement
in
then
Prime

gave
a

in
contrary
to

named
continued

violence
as
disruptive
to
the

a
call
viewed

In

international
outrage
followed
Israeli
steps
to
further
entrench
the
Jewish
settlements
in

Bank
including
East
Jerusalem
which
included
the
publishing
of

and
the

the
move
was
a
breach
of
Israeli
commitments
under
the
road
map
to
freeze
all

expansion
in

the
Systematic

activity
poses

significant
and
live
threat
to

In

the
foreign

In

in

though
under

it

significantly

Charges
of
incitement
have
been
reciprocal
both
sides
interpreting
media
statements
in
the
Palestinian

Israeli
press
as
constituting
incitement

Schoolbooks

Both
the
Israeli

the
Palestinian
sides

both
moderate

bodies
as

as

One
of
the
primary
obstacles
to

the
Israeli
Palestinian
conflict

a
deep

and
growing
distrust

security
becomes

The
expansion
of

has
led
the

of
Palestinians
to
believe
that
Israel
is
not
committed
to
reaching
an
agreement

rather
to
a
pursuit
of
establishing
permanent

The

The

Judaism
Christianity

Jerusalem
as

Jerusalem

Judaism

the
former
location
of
the
Jewish
temples
on
the
Temple
Mount
and
the
capital
of
the
ancient
Israelite
kingdom

For
Muslims
Jerusalem
is
the
third
holiest
site
being
the
location
of
Isra

event
and
the

For
Christians
Jerusalem
is

that

have
a
right
to

to
the
places

and
including

lines

they
have
countenanced
the

The
Israeli
Law
of
Return
that
grants
citizenship
to
people
of
Jewish
descent
is
viewed
by
critics
as
discriminatory
against
other
ethnic
groups
especially
Palestinians
that
cannot
apply
for
such
citizenship
under
the
law
of
return
to
the
territory
which
they
were
expelled
from
or
fled
during
the
course
of
the
war

According
to
the
UN
Resolution
adopted
in
the
refugees
wishing
to
return
to
their
homes
and
live
at
peace
with
their
neighbours
should
be
permitted
to
do
so
at
the
earliest
practicable
date
and
that
compensation
should
be
paid
for
the
property
of
those
choosing
not
to
return
and
for
loss
of
or
damage
to
property
which
under
principles
of
international
law
or
in
equity
should
be
made
good
by
the
Governments
or
authorities
responsible

UN
Resolution
reaffirms
also
the
inalienable
right
of
the
Palestinians
to
return
to
their
homes
and
property
from
which
they
have
been
displaced
and
uprooted
and
calls
for
their
return


Resolution
from
the
UN
affirms
the
necessity
for
achieving
a
just
settlement
of
the
refugee
problem
however
Resolution
does
not
specify
that
the
just
settlement
must
or
should
be
in
the
form
of
a
literal
Palestinian
right
of
return

The
most
common
arguments
for
opposition
are


On
the
August
at
the
United
Nations
Security
Council
Israel
declared
that
it
is
not
reasonable
to
contemplate
a
return
of
the
refugees
as
the
Arab
League
and
the
Arab
High
Committee
have
announced
their
intentions
to
continue
their
war
of
aggression
and
resume
hostilities
noting
that
the
state
of
war
has
not
been
lifted
and
that
no
peace
treaty
has
been
signed

However
Israel
accepted
the
next
year
the
return
of
some
of
the
refugees
notably
through
the
annexation
of
the
Gaza
Strip
or
by
absorbing


of
them
in
exchange
of
a
peace
treaty

The
Arab
countries
refused
the
proposal
demanding
a
complete
return



The
Palestinian
refugee
issue
is
handled
by
a
separate
authority
from
that
handling
other
refugees
that
is
by
UNRWA
and
not
the
UNHCR

Most
of
the
people
recognizing
themselves
as
Palestinian
refugees
would
have
otherwise
been
assimilated
into
their
country
of
current
residency
and
would
not
maintain
their
refugee
state
if
not
for
the
separate
entities



Concerning
the
origin
of
the
Palestinian
refugees
the
Israeli
government
said
that
during
the
War
the
Arab
Higher
Committee
and
the
Arab
states
encouraged
Palestinians
to
flee
in
order
to
make
it
easier
to
rout
the
Jewish
state
or
that
they
did
so
to
escape
the
fights
by
fear

The
Palestinian
narrative
is
that
refugees
were
largely
expelled
and
dispossessed
by
Jewish
militias
and
by
the
Israeli
army

Historians
still
debate
the
causes
of
the
Palestinian
exodus

Notably
historian
Benny
Morris
states
that
most
of
Palestine
s
refugees
fled
because
of
the
flail
of
war
and
expected
to
return
home
shortly
after
a
successful
Arab
invasion

He
documents
instances
in
which
Arab
leaders
advised
the
evacuation
of
entire
communities
as
happened
in
Haifa

In
his
scholarly
work
however
he
does
conclude
that
there
were
expulsions
which
were
carried
out

Morris
considers
the
displacement
the
result
of
a
national
conflict
initiated
by
the
Arabs
themselves

In
a
interview
with
Haaretz
he
described
the
exodus
as
largely
resulting
from
an
atmosphere
of
transfer
that
was
promoted
by
Ben
Gurion
and
understood
by
the
military
leadership

He
also
claimed
that
there
are
circumstances
in
history
that
justify
ethnic
cleansing


He
has
been
criticized
by
political
scientist
Norman
Finkelstein
for
having
seemingly
changed
his
views
for
political
rather
than
historical
reasons

Since
Jewish
people
who
fled
or
otherwise
emigrated
from
the
Arab
world
after
the
Israeli
declaration
of
independence
were
never
compensated
or
repatriated
by
their
former
countries
of
residence
to
no
objection
on
the
part
of
Arab
leaders
a
precedent
has
been
set
whereby
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
nation
which
accepts
the
refugees
to
assimilate
them

Although
Israel
accepts
the
right
of
the
Palestinian
Diaspora
to
return
into
a
new
Palestinian
state
Israel
insists
that
the
return
of
this
population
into
the
current
state
of
Israel
would
be
a
great
danger
for
the
stability
of
the
Jewish
state
an
influx
of
Palestinian
refugees
would
lead
to
the
destruction
of
the
state
of
Israel

According
to
Efraim
Karsh
the
Palestinians
were
themselves
the
aggressors
in
the
war
who
attempted
to
cleanse
a
neighboring
ethnic
community

Had
the
United
Nations
resolution
of
November
recommending
partition
in
Palestine

reports
of
large
numbers
of

refugees

The
British
High
Commissioner
for

morale
in

that
he
partially
attributed
to
the
increasing
tendency
of
those
who
should
be
leading
them
to
leave
the
country
and
the
considerable
evacuations
of
the
Arab
effendi
class

Huge
numbers
of

to
prevent
them
from
becoming

citizens

Accords
in

in
December
As
far
as
Israel
is
concerned
the
jurisdiction
of
the
Palestinian
Authority
is
derived
from
the
Oslo
Accords
signed
with
the
PLO
under
which
it
acquired
control
over
cities
in
the
Palestinian
territories
Area

surrounding
countryside
came
either
under
Israeli
security
and

Area
C


Israel
has
built
additional
highways
to
allow
Israelis
to
traverse
the
area
without
entering
Palestinian
cities
in
Area
A

The
initial
areas
under
Palestinian
Authority
control
are
diverse
and
non
contiguous

The
areas
have
changed
over
time
by
subsequent
negotiations
including
Oslo
II
Wye
River
and
Sharm
el
Sheik

According
to
Palestinians
the
separated
areas
make
it
impossible
to
create
a
viable
nation
and
fails
to
address
Palestinian
security
needs
Israel
has
expressed
no
agreement
to
withdrawal
from
some
Areas
B
resulting
in
no
reduction
in
the
division
of
the
Palestinian
areas
and
the
institution
of
a
safe
pass
system
without
Israeli
checkpoints
between
these
parts

Under
the
Oslo
Accords
as
a
security
measure
Israel
has
insisted
on
its
control
over
all
land
sea
and
air
border
crossings
into
the
Palestinian
territories
and
the
right
to
set
import
and
export
controls

This
is
to
enable
Israel
to
control
the
entry
into
the
territories
of
materials
of
military
significance
and
of
potentially
dangerous
persons

The
PLO
s
objective
for
international
recognition
of
the
State
of
Palestine
is
considered
by
Israel
as
a
provocative
unilateral
act
that

politics

In

water

are
of

political
concern

Since

much
of

from

large
underground
aquifers
which

under

Line
the
use
of
this

has
been
contentious
in

Palestinian
conflict

Israel
withdraws
most
water
from
these
areas
but
it
also
supplies
the
West
Bank
with
approximately
million
cubic
metres
annually
contributing
to
of
Palestinians
water
supply
in
the
West
Bank
which
is
to
be
shared
for
a
population
of

While
Israel
s

of

decreased
since
it
began
its
occupation
of
the

it
still
consumes
the

in
the
s
Israel
consumed
of
the
water
output
of
the
Western
Aquifer
and
of
that
produced
by
the
Northeastern
Aquifer

Although
this
water
was
drawn
entirely
on
Israel
s
own
side
of
the
pre
border
the
sources
of
the
water
are
nevertheless
from
the
shared
groundwater
basins
located
under

West
Bank
and
Israel

In
the
Oslo
II
Accord
both
sides
agreed
to
maintain
existing
quantities
of
utilization
from
the
resources

In
so
doing
the
Palestinian
Authority
established
the
legality
of
Israeli
water
production
in
the
West
Bank
subject
to
a
Joint
Water
Committee
JWC


Moreover
Israel
obligated
itself
in
this
agreement
to
provide
water
to
supplement
Palestinian
production
and
further
agreed
to
allow
additional
Palestinian
drilling
in
the
Eastern
Aquifer
also
subject
to

Committee

The
water
that

comes
mainly
from

the

Interpretations

It
has
been
the
position
of
Israel
that
the
most
Arab
populated
parts
of
West
Bank
without
major
Jewish
settlements
as
well
as
the
entire
Gaza
Strip
must
eventually
be
part
of
an
independent
Palestinian
State
however
the
precise
borders
of
this

are
in

At
Camp
David
for
example
then
Israeli
Prime
Minister
Ehud
Barak
offered
Arafat
an
opportunity
to
establish
a
non
militarized
Palestinian
State

The
proposed
state
would
consist
of
of
the
West

into
two
or
three
areas
followed
by
an
increase
of
of

autonomy
but
not
sovereignty
for
some
of
the
Arab
neighborhoods
of
East
Jerusalem
surrounded
by
Israeli
territory
the
entire
Gaza
Strip
and
the
dismantling
of
most
settlements

Arafat
rejected
the
proposal
without
providing
a
counter
offer

A
subsequent
settlement
proposed
by
President
Clinton
offered
Palestinian
sovereignty
over
to
percent
of
the
West
Bank
but
was
similarly
rejected
with
objections

The
Arab
League
has
agreed

swaps
as

of

borders

Official
U
S

policy
also
reflects
the
ideal
of
using
the
borders
as
a
basis
for
an
eventual
peace
agreement

Some
Palestinians
say
they
are
entitled
to
all
of
the
West
Bank
Gaza
Strip
and
East
Jerusalem

Israel
says
it
is
justified
in
not
ceding
all
this
land
because
of
security
concerns
and
also
because
the
lack
of
any
valid
diplomatic
agreement
at
the
time
means
that
ownership
and
boundaries
of
this
land
is
open
for
discussion

Palestinians
claim
any
reduction
of
this
claim
is
a
severe
deprivation
of
their
rights

In
negotiations
they
claim
that
any
moves
to
reduce
the
boundaries
of
this
land
is
a
hostile
move
against
their
key
interests

Israel
considers
this
land
to
be
in
dispute
and
feels
the
purpose
of
negotiations
is
to
define
what
the
final
borders
will
be

In

announced
that
it
was
ready
to
support
a
Palestinian
state
on
the

without
recognising
Israel
or
ceding
any

Hamas

viewed
the

comparable
to

framework
of

We

Israeli
Palestinian
relations
Since
the
beginning
of
the
Israeli
Palestinian
conflict
the
conflict
has
been
about
land

When
Israel
became
a
state
after
the
war
in
of
Palestine
s
land
was
used
for
the
creation
on
the
state

The
majority
of
those
living
in
Palestine
at
the
time
became
refugees
in
other
countries
and
this
first
land
crisis
became
the
root
of
the
Israeli
Palestinian
conflict

Because
the
root
of
the
conflict
is
with
land
the
disputes
between
Israel
and
Palestine
are
well
manifested
in
the
agriculture
of
Palestine

In
Palestine
agriculture
is
a
mainstay
in
the
economy

The
production
of
agricultural
goods
supports
the
population
s
sustenance
needs
and
fuels
Palestine
s
export
economy

According
to
the
Council
for
European
Palestinian
Relations
the
agricultural
sector
formally
employs


of
the
population
and
informally
employs
of
the
population

Over
the
past
years
when
unemployment
rates
in
Palestine
have
increased
and
the
agricultural
sector
became
the
most
impoverished
sector
in
Palestine

Unemployment
rates
peaked
in
when
they
reached
in
Gaza

Palestinian
agriculture
suffers
from
numerous
problems
including
Israeli
military
and
civilian
attacks
on
farms
and
farmers
blockades
to
exportation
of
produce
and
importation
of
necessary
inputs
widespread
confiscation
of
land
for
nature

as
well
as
military
and
settler
use
confiscation
and

IMG
The
barrier
between
Israel
and
Palestine
With
the
construction
of
the
separation
barrier
the
Israeli
state
promised
free
movement
across
regions

However
border
closures
curfews
and
checkpoints
has
significantly
restricted
Palestinian
movement

In
there
were
fixed
check
points
and
flying
checkpoints

The
border
restrictions
impacted
the
imports
and
exports
in
Palestine
and
weakened
the
industrial
and
agricultural
sectors
because
of
the
constant
Israeli
control
in
the
West
Bank
and
Gaza

In
order
for
the
Palestinian
economy
to
be
prosperous
the
restrictions
on
Palestinian
land
must
be
removed

According
to
The
Guardian
and
a
report
for
World
Bank
the
Palestinian
economy
lost


bn
of
the
annual
GDP
to
Israeli
restrictions
in
the
West

Letters
of
Mutual
Recognition
Between
Israel
and
the
PLO
Beginning
in
with
the
Oslo

process
Israel
recognizes
the
PLO
as
the
representative
of
the
Palestinian
people
though
Israel
does
not
recognize
the
State
of
Palestine

In
return
it
was
agreed
that
Palestinians
would
promote
peaceful
co
existence
renounce
violence
and
promote
recognition
of
Israel
among
their
own
people

Despite
Yasser
Arafat
s
official
renunciation
of
terrorism
and
recognition
of
Israel
some
Palestinian
groups
continue
to
practice
and
advocate
violence
against
civilians
and
do
not
recognize
Israel
as
a
legitimate
political
entity

unreliable
source
Palestinians
state
that
their
ability
to
spread
acceptance
of
Israel
was
greatly
hampered
by
Israeli
restrictions
on
Palestinian
political
freedoms
economic
freedoms
civil
liberties
and
quality
of
life

Of
Israel
as
a
Jewish
state
The
Palestinian
president
Mahmoud
Abbas
has
in
recent
years
refused
to
recognize
Israel
as
a
Jewish
state
citing
concerns
for
Israeli
Arabs
and
a
possible
future
right
to
return
for
Palestinian
refugees
though
Palestine
continues
to

as

The
Palestinian
Authority
is
considered
corrupt
by
a
wide
variety
of
sources
including
some
Palestinians

Some
Israelis
argue
that
it
provides
tacit

and
other
Islamic
militant
movements
and
that

or
especially
according
to
the
right
wing
of
Israeli
politics
even
negotiating
about

Because

that
a

declared
they

which
had
been
cooperating
with

at

levels
in

The
US
government
has
spent
over

building
and
training
the
Palestinian
National
Security
Forces

The

maintains
that

Residents

are
more

Three
factors
made
Israel
s
territorial
offer
less
forthcoming
than
it
initially
appeared

First
the
percent
land
offer
was
based
on
the
Israeli
definition
of
the
West
Bank
but
this
differs
by
approximately
percentage
points
from
the
Palestinian
definition

Palestinians
use
a
total
area
of
square
kilometers

Israel
however
omits
the
area
known
as
No
Man
s
Land
km
near
Latrun
post
East
Jerusalem
km
and
the
territorial
waters
of
the
Dead
Sea
km
which
reduces
the
total
to
km


Thus
an
Israeli
offer
of
percent
of
km
of
the
West
Bank
translates
into
only
percent
from
the
Palestinian
perspective

Currently
freedom
of
movement
and
access
for
Palestinians
within
the
West
Bank
is
the
exception
rather
than
the
norm
contrary
to
the
commitments
undertaken
in
a
number
of
Agreements
between
GOI
and
the
PA

In
particular
both
the
Oslo
Accords
and
the
Road
Map
were
based
on
the
principle
that
normal
Palestinian
economic
and
social
life
would
be
unimpeded
by
restrictions

Makdisi
rightly
argues
that
almost
every
law
of
South
African
Apartheid
has
its
equivalent
in
Israel
today

A
significant
example
is
the
Law
of
Return
which
even
Kretzmer
claims
is
explicitly
discriminatory
against
Palestinian
citizens




The
Law
of
Return
which
determines
the
second
class
citizenship
of
Palestinians
is
recognized
as
a
fundamental
principle
in
Israel
and
is
possibly
even
its
very
raison
d
etre
as
a
Jewish
state

In
any
case
has
the
Law
of
Return
discriminatory
effect
for
Palestinian
Arab
people
since
it
allows
any
Jew
to
immigrate
to
Israel
while
at
the
same
time
it
deprives
all
native
Palestinian
Arab
refugees
residing
outside
the
borders
of
the
state
of
Israel
of
their
fundamental
right
to
return
to
their
homes
and
villages
from
which
they
were
expelled
or
took
flight
in
the
course
of
the
war
that
broke

Under
the
heading
of
Discrimination
the
Committee
cited
Israel
s
Law
of
Return
as
discriminatory
against
Palestinian
refugees
because
of
Israel
s
refusal
to
readmit
them

The
committee
said
The
Committee
notes
with
concern
that
the
Law
of
Return
which
permits
any
Jew
from
anywhere
in
the
world
to
immigrate
and
thereby
virtually
automatically
enjoy
residence
and
obtain
citizenship
in
Israel
discriminates
against
Palestinians
in
the
Diaspora
upon
whom
the
Government
of
Israel
has
imposed
restrictive
requirements
that
make
it
almost
impossible
to
return
to
their
land
of
birth

War
film
is
a
film
genre
concerned
with
warfare
typically
about
naval
air
or
land
battles
with
combat
scenes
central
to
the
drama

Themes
explored
include
combat
survival
and
escape
camaraderie
between
soldiers
sacrifice
the
futility
and
inhumanity
of
battle
the
effects
of
war
on
society
and
the
moral
and
human
issues
raised
by
war

The
stories
told
may
be
fiction
historical
drama
or
biographical

Subgenres
not
necessarily
distinct
include
anti
war
comedy
propaganda
and
documentary

There
are
similarly
subgenres
of
the
war
film
in
specific
theatres
such
as
the
Western
Desert
of
North
Africa
and
the
Pacific
in
the
Second
World
War
Vietnam
or
the
Soviet
Afghan
War
and
films
set
in
specific
domains
of
war
such
as
the
infantry
the
air
at
sea
in
submarines
or
at
prisoner
of

List
of
war
films
The
war
film
genre
is
not
necessarily
tightly
defined
the
American
Film
Institute
for
example
speaks
of
films
to
grapple
with
the
Great
War
without
attempting
to
classify
these

However
some
directors
and
critics
have
offered
at
least
tentative
definitions

The
director
Sam
Fuller
defined
the
genre
by
saying
that
a
war
film
s
objective
no
matter
how
personal
or
emotional
is
to
make
a
viewer
feel
war

John
Belton
identified
four
narrative
elements
of
the
war
film
within
the
context
of
Hollywood
production
a
the
suspension
of
civilian
morality
during
times
of
war
b
primacy
of
collective
goals
over
individual
motivations
c
rivalry
between
men
in
predominantly
male
groups
as
well
as
marginalization
and
objectification
of
women
and
d
depiction
of
the
reintegration
of
veterans

The
fateful
nature
of
battle
scenes
means
that
war
films
often
end
with
them

IMG
John
Wayne
in
The
Longest
Day
The
film
critic
Stephen
Neale
suggests
that
the
genre
is
for
the
most
part
well
defined
and
uncontentious
since
war
films
are
simply
those
about
war
being
waged
in
the
th
century
with
combat
scenes
central
to
the
drama

However
Neale
notes
films
set
in
the
American
Civil
War
or
the
American
Indian
Wars
of
the
th
century
were
called
war
films
in
the
time
before
the
First
World
War

The
critic
Julian
Smith
argues
on
the
contrary
that
the
war
film
lacks
the
formal
boundaries
of
a
genre
like
the
Western
but
that
in
practice
successful
and
influential
war
films
are
about
modern
wars
in
particular
World
War
II
with
the
combination
of
mobile
forces
and
mass
killing

The
film
scholar
Kathryn
Kane
points
out
some
similarities
between
the
war
film
genre
and
the
Western

Both
genres
use
opposing
concepts
like
war
and
peace
civilization
and
savagery

War
films
usually
frame
World
War
II
as
a
conflict
between
good
and
evil
as
represented
by
the
Allied
forces
and
Nazi
Germany
whereas
the
Western
portrays
the
conflict
between
civilized
settlers
and
the
savage
indigenous
peoples

James
Clarke
notes
the
similarity
between
a
Western
like
Sam
Peckinpah
s
The
Wild
Bunch
and
war
movie
escapades
like
The
Dirty
Dozen

The
film
historian
Jeanine
Basinger
states
that
she
began
with
a
preconception
of
what
the
war
film
genre
would
be
namely
that
What
I
knew
in
advance
was
what
presumably
every
member
of
our
culture
would
know
about
World
War
II
combat
films
that
they
contained
a
hero
a
group
of
mixed
types
of
people
and
a
military
objective
of
some
sort

They
take
place
in
the
actual
combat
zones
of
World
War
II
against
the
established
enemies
on
the
ground
the
sea
or
in
the
air

They
contain
many
repeated
events
such
as
mail
call
all
presented
visually
with
appropriate
uniforms
equipment
and
iconography
of
battle

Further
Basinger
considers
Bataan
to
provide
a
definition
by
example
of
the
World
War
II
combat
film
in
which
a
diverse
and
apparently
unsuited
group
of
hastily
assembled
volunteers
hold
off
a
much
larger
group
of
the
enemy
through
their
bravery
and
tenacity


She
argues
that
the
combat
film
is
not
a
subgenre
but
the
only
genuine
kind
of
war
film

Since
she
notes
that
there
were
in
fact
only
five
true
combat
films
made
during
the
Second
World
War
in
her
view
these
few
films
central
to
the
genre
are
outweighed
by
the
many
other
films
that
are
only
just
war
films

However
other
critics
such
as
Russell
Earl
Shain
propose
a
far
broader
definition
of
war
film
to
include
films
that
deal
with
the
roles
of
civilians
espionage
agents
and
soldiers
in
any
of
the
aspects
of
war
i
e

preparation
cause
prevention
conduct
daily
life
and
consequences
or
aftermath

Neale
points
out
that
genres
overlap
with
combat
scenes
for
different
purposes
in
other
types
of
film
and
suggests
that
war
films
are
characterised
by
combat
which
determines
the
fate
of
the
principal
characters


This
in
turn
pushes
combat
scenes
to
the
climactic
ends
of
war
films

Not
all
critics
agree
either
that
war
films
must
be
about
th
century
wars

James
Clarke
includes
Edward
Zwick
s
Oscar
winning
Glory
among
the
war
films
he
discusses
in
detail
it
is
set
in
the
American
Civil
War
and
he
lists
six
other
films
about
that
war
which
he
considers
notable


a
The
screenwriter
and
scholar
Eric
R

Williams
identifies
war
films
as
one
of
eleven
super
genres
in
his
screenwriters
taxonomy
claiming
that
all
feature
length
narrative
films
can
be
classified
as
belonging
to
one
of
them

b
The
British
military
historian
Antony
Beevor
despair
s
at
how
film
makers
from
America
and
Britain
play
fast
and
loose
with
the
facts
yet
imply
that
their
version
is
as
good
as
the
truth


For
example
he
calls
the
American
film
U
a
shameless
deception
for
pretending
that
a
US
warship
had
helped
to
win
the
Battle
of
the
Atlantic
seven
months
before
America
entered
the
war

He
is
equally
critical
of
Christopher
Nolan
s
film
Dunkirk
with
its
unhistorically
empty
beaches
low
level
air
combat
over
the
sea
and
rescues
mainly
by
the
little
ships


Beevor
feels
however
that
Continental
European
film
makers
are
often
far
more
scrupulous
for
example
in
his
view
the
German
film
Downfall
accurately
depicted
the
historical
events
of
Hitler
s
final
days
in
his
Berlin
bunker
and
he
considers
the
French
film
The
th
Platoon
set
in
Vietnam
the
greatest
war
movie
ever
made


The
film
The
Battle
of
Algiers

argues
a

has
been
the
subject
of
or
the
backdrop
to
numerous
films

films
using
the
Civil

as
its
subject
was
D

The

Films
that
have
the

include
the
film

the
first
formal
unit
of
the
Union
Army
during
the
American
Civil
War
to
be
made
up
entirely
of
Black
volunteers

Some
films

as
Gettysburg
focused
on
a

battle
during
the
war
or
even
on
a
single
incident
like
the
French
short
film
La

An
Occurrence
at
Owl

and
Disney
s
The
Great
Locomotive
Chase


Others
like
the
miniseries
North

spanned
the
entire
breadth
of
the

Some
films
deal
with
the
human
aspects
of
the

as
The

it
what
the
critic
Francine

Films
in
North
Korea
were
made
by

and
had
clear
political
messages

The
first
was

as

Critics
such

explain
that
Hollywood
avoided
the
subject
because
of
opposition
to

involvement
in

War
making
the
subject
divisive
in
addition
the

industry
was
in

the

did
not
wish
to
assist

anti

films

From

be
treated

Feature
films
made
in
the
west
during
the
war
were
subject
to
censorship
and
were
not
always
realistic
in
nature

One
of
the
first
to
attempt
to
represent
violence
and
which
was
praised
at
the
time
for
gritty
realism
was
Tay
Garnett
s
Bataan


The
depiction
actually
remained
stylised

Jeanine
Basinger
gives
as
an
example
the
worst
image
for
stark
violence
when
a
Japanese
soldier
beheads
an
American
the
victim
shows
pain
and
his
lips
freeze
in
a
scream
yet
no
blood
spurts
and
his
head
does
not
fall
off

Basinger
points
out
that
while
this
is
physically
unrealistic
psychologically
it
may
not
have
been

The
wartime
audience
was
she
points
out

in

to

ended

For
Japan
the
war
began
with
the
undeclared
war
and
invasion
of
China
in
which
the
Japanese
authorities
called
The
China
Incident


The
government
dispatched
a
pen
brigade
to
write
and
film
the
action
in
China
with
humanist
values

Takeshi

common
Japanese
soldier
as
an
individual
and
as
a
family
man
and
even
enemy
Chinese
soldiers
are
presented
as
individuals
sometimes
fighting
bravely

Once
war
with
the
United
States
was
declared
the
Japanese
conflict
became
known
as
the
Pacific
War

Japanese
film
critics
worried
that
even
with
Western
film
techniques
their
film
output
failed
to
represent
native
Japanese
values

The
historian
John
Dower
found
that
Japanese
wartime
films
had
been
largely
forgotten
as
losers
do
not
get
reruns
yet
they
were
so
subtle
and
skilful
that
Frank
Capra
thought
Chocolate
and
Soldiers
unbeatable

Heroes
were
typically
low
ranking
officers
not
samurai
calmly
devoted
to
his
men
and
his
country

These
films
did
not
personalise
the
enemy
and
therefore
lacked
hatred
though
Great
Britain
could
figure
as
the
cultural
enemy


For
Japanese
film
makers
war
was
not
a
cause
but
more
like
a
natural
disaster
and
what
mattered
was
not
whom
one
fought
but
how
well


Asian
enemies
especially
the
Chinese
were
often
portrayed
as
redeemable
and
even
possible
marriage
partners

Japanese
wartime
films
do
not
glorify
war
but
present
the
Japanese
state
as
one
great
family
and
the
Japanese
people
as
an
innocent
suffering
self
sacrificing
people


Dower
comments
that
the
perversity
of
this
image
is
obvious
it
is
devoid
of
any
recognition

level

Shooting
a
scene
from
A
Bridge
Too
Far
on
location
in
Deventer
Netherlands
According
to
Andrew
Pulver
of
The
Guardian
the
public
fascination
with
war
films
became
an
obsession
with
over
war
films
produced
in
each
decade
of
the
s
and
s

War
film
production
in
the
United
Kingdom
and
United
States
reached
its
zenith
in
the
mid
s

Its
popularity
in
the
United
Kingdom
was
brought
on
by
the
critical
and
commercial
success
of
Charles
Frend
s
The
Cruel
Sea


Like
others
of
the
period
The
Cruel
Sea
was
based
on
a
bestselling
novel
in
this
case
the
former
naval
commander
Nicholas
Monsarrat
s
story
of
the
battle
of
the
Atlantic

Others
like
The
Dam
Busters
with
its
exciting
tale
of
the
inventor
Barnes
Wallis
s
unorthodox
bouncing
bomb
and
its
distinctive
theme
music
were
true
stories

The
Dam
Busters
became
the
most
popular
film
in
Britain
in
and
remained
a
favourite
as
of
with
a
score
on
Rotten
Tomatoes
though
partly
because
it
celebrated
an
exclusively
British
victory
it
failed
in
the
American
market

A
large
number
of
war
films
were
made
in
the
period
in
particular

In
alone
Bitter
Victory
Count
Five
and
Die
The
Enemy

Moonlight
Men

The

That

and
the
highly
successful
critically
acclaimed
pictures
The
Bridge
on
the
River
Kwai
which
won
the
Academy
Award
for
Best
Picture
that
year
and
Paths
of
Glory
were
released

Some
such
as
Bitter
Victory
focused
more
on
the
psychological
battle
between
officers
and
egotism
rather
than
events
during
the
war

The
Bridge
on
the
River
Kwai
brought
a
new
complexity
to
the
war
picture
with
a
sense
of
moral
uncertainty
surrounding
war

By
the
end
of
the
decade
the
sense
of
shared
achievement
which
had
been
common
in
war
films
began
to
evaporate
according
to
Pulver

Hollywood
films
in
the
s
and
s
could
display
spectacular
heroics
or
self
sacrifice
as
in
the
popular
Sands
of
Iwo
Jima
starring
John
Wayne

U
S

Marines
considered
Sands
of
Iwo
Jima
visually
authentic
but
found
Lewis
Milestone
s
Battle
Cry
with
its
attention
to
the
lives
of
the
men
the
more
realistic
film

The
formula
for
a
successful
war
film
consisted
according
to
Lawrence
Suid
of
a
small
group
of
ethnically
diverse
men
an
unreasonable
senior
officer
cowards
became
heroic
or
died

Jeanine
Basinger
suggests
that
a
traditional
war
film
should
have
a
hero
a
group
and
an
objective
and
that
the
group
should
contain
an
Italian
a
Jew
a
cynical
complainer
from
Brooklyn
a
sharpshooter
from
the
mountains
a
midwesterner
nicknamed
by
his
state
Iowa
or
Dakota
and
a
character
who
must
be
initiated
in
some
way


Films
based

real
commando
missions

on
the

Raid
and
Ill

by
Moonlight

inspired
fictional

In
Lawrence
Suid
s
view
The

Day
served
as
the
model
for
all
subsequent
combat
spectaculars


However
its
cost
also
made
it
the
last
of

films
while
the
controversy
around
the
help
given
by
the
U
S

Army
and
Zanuck
s
disregard
for
Pentagon
relations
changed
the
way
that
Hollywood
and
the
Army
collaborated

Zanuck
by

at
th

set
up
an
American
Japanese
co

for
Richard
Fleischer
s
Tora
Tora
Tora
to
depict
what
really
happened
on

in

surprise
attack
on
Pearl

The
film
panned
by
Roger
Ebert
and
The
New

was
a
major
success
in
Japan

Its
realistic
looking
attack
footage
was
reused
in
later
films
such
as
Midway
The
Final
Countdown
and
Australia


The
story
was
revisited
in
Pearl
Harbor
described
by
The
New

Times
as
a
noisy
expensive
and
very
long
new
blockbuster
with
the
comment
that
for
all
its
epic
pretensions
as
if
epic
were
a
matter
of
running
time
tumescent
music
and
earnest
voice
over
pronouncements
the
movie
works
best
as

accustomed

so
as
to
create
what
film
historian
Stuart
Bender
calls
reported
realism
whether
or
not
the
portrayal
is
genuinely
more
realistic

Jeanine
Basinger
notes
that
critics
experienced
it
as
groundbreaking
and
anti
generic
with
in
James
Wolcott
s
words
a
desire
to
bury
the
cornball
recruiting
poster
legend
of
John
Wayne
to
get
it
right
this
time
and
that
combat
films
have
always
been
grounded
in
the
need
to
help
an
audience
understand
and
accept
war


Its
success

tried
to
portray
the
reality
of

as
in

Stalingrad

The

said

about

In

to
elements

especially
mutiny

the

The

Michael

with

travelling

of

films
in

camps
such
as
Stalag

Despite

delight

of

and
ingenuity
celebrating

Anti
war
Lewis
Milestone
s
All
Quiet
on
the
Western
Front
The
anti
war
genre
began
with
films
about
the
First
World
War

Films
in
the
genre
are
typically
revisionist
reflecting
on
past
events
and
often
generically
blended

Lewis
Milestone
s
All
Quiet
on
the
Western
Front
was
unquestionably
powerful
and
an
early
anti
war
film
portraying
a
German
point
of
view
it
was
the
first
film
in
any
genre
to
win
two
Oscars
best
picture
and
best
director

Andrew
Kelly
analysing
All
Quiet
on
the
Western
Front
defined
the
genre
as
showing
the
brutality
of
war
the
amount
of
human
suffering
the
betrayal
of
men
s
trust
by
incompetent
officers

War
and
anti
war
films
often
prove
difficult
to
categorize
as
they
contain
many
generic
ambiguities

While
many
anti
war
films
criticize
war
directly
through
depictions
of
grisly
combat
in
past
wars
some
films
such
as
Penn
s
Alice
s
Restaurant
criticized
war
obliquely
by
poking
fun
at
such
things
as
the
draft
board

The
number
of
anti
war
films
produced
in
America
dipped
sharply
during
the
s
because
of
McCarthyism
and
the
Hollywood
blacklist

The
end
of
the
blacklist
and
the
introduction
of
the
MPAA
rating
system
marked
a
time
of
resurgence
for
films
of
all
type
including
anti
war
films
in
the
States

Robert
Eberwein
names
two
films
as
anti
war
classics

The
first
is
Jean
Renoir
s
prisoner
of
war
masterpiece
La
Grande
Illusion
The
Grand
Illusion


Renoir
s
critique
of
contemporary
politics
and
ideology
celebrates
the
universal
humanity
that
transcends
national
and
racial
boundaries
and
radical
nationalism
suggesting
that
mankind
s
common
experiences
should
prevail
above
political
division
and
its
extension
war

The
second
is
Stanley
Kubrick
s
Paths
of
Glory


The
critic
David
Ehrenstein
writes
that
Paths
of
Glory
established
Kubrick
as
the
leading
commercial
filmmaker
of
his
generation
and
a
world
class
talent

Ehrenstein
describes
the
film
as
an
outwardly
cool
inwardly
passionate
protest
drama
about
a
disastrous
French
army
maneuver
and
the
court
martial
held
in
its
wake
contrasting
it
with
the
classic
All
Quiet
on
the
Western
Front
s
story
of
an
innocent
unstrung
by
the
horrors
of
war


Mixed
genres
edit
Comedy
gave
scope
for
satire
and
post
war
film
makers
merged
comedy
and
anti
war
sentiment
in
films
as
varied
as
Stalag
and
Dr
Strangelove


Black
comedies
like
Mike
Nichols
s
Catch
based
on
Joseph
Heller
s
satirical
novel
about
the
Second
World
War
and
Robert
Altman
s
MASH
set
in
Korea
reflected
the
attitudes
of
an
increasingly
sceptical
public
during
the
Vietnam
War

Other
genres
were
combined
in
Franklin
J

Schaffner
s
Patton
about
real
life
General
George
S

Patton
where
combat
scenes
were
interleaved
with
commentary
about
how
he
waged
war
showing
good
and
bad
sides
to
a
command

It
and
MASH
became
the
two
most
profitable
war
anti
war
films
made
up
to
that
time
and
Patton
won
seven
Academy
Awards

notable
Civil

War
film
is
serious
business

It
has
been
from
the
beginning
when
William
Wellman
s
Wings
became
the
first
World
War
I
romantic
drama
to
win
an
Oscar
for
best
picture

One
hundred
years
later
the
supply
of
war
films
seems
inexhaustible
and
their
box
office
attraction
unbroken

Adjusted

inflation

The
war
film
genre
and
its
fascination
remains

There
we
sit
watching
generations
get
wiped
out

We
see
terrifying
technological
inventions
like
the
atomic
bomb
being
dropped
on
Hiroshima

Removed
from
actual
war
in
time
and
place
these
big
screen
productions
are
horrible
yet
spellbinding
at
the
same
time

War
Horse
is
a
particularly
effective
exploration
of
this
experience
and
what
it
gives
to
audiences

Steven
Spielberg
s
film
tells
the
story
of
a
young
horse
and
his
owner
forced
from
the
idyllic
fields
of
rural
England
into
the
bloody
trenches
of
first
world
war
France

War
Horse
illustrates
the
fragile
balance
of
peace
and
how
sacrifice
forms
lasting
bonds
across
borders
languages
and
species
echoing
the
Great
War
s
hard
won
reconciliation
process
as
Europeans
bonded
over
grief
and
common
trauma

Spielberg
pairs
moral
guidance
and
a
sense
of
what
really
matters
in
life
with
breathtaking
landscape
shots
and
fast
paced
action
sequences

But
this
is
only
one
story
and
only
one
way
to
present
war
as
a
noble
sacrifice
to
forge
unity

There
is
no
standard
formula
to
explain
why
the
experience
of
war
continuously
attracts
millions
of
viewers

The
answer
is
different
for
each
war
story
and
it
is
different
in
each
nation

The
national
war
complex
The
first
Australian
film
to
win
an
Academy
Award
was
Damien
Parer
s
documentary
of
the
fighting
in
New
Guinea
in


The
film
garnered
a
Best
Documentary
Oscar
for
bringing
the
immediate
experience
of
humanity
at
war
to
Australia
the
wounded
the
anxiety
the
young
soldiers
fear
of
death
far
from
home

Parer
himself
was
killed
in
action
in
in
the
Palau
archipelago
in
Micronesia

His
cinematic
legacy
is
a
sobering
documentation
of
Australians
at
war
without
flagwavers
or
hyper
masculine
action
heroes

Damien
Parer
also
shot
photographs
while
in
New
Guinea
including
this
one
at
a
rest
spot
on
the
Kokoda
Trail

Australian
War
Memorial
SBS
recently
ran
a
week
of
war
films
in
the
lead
up
to
ANZAC
Day
leading
with
Churchill
which
portrays
the
inner
world
of
Britain
s
wartime
prime
minister

Downfall
looks
at
Hitler
s
final
days
barricaded
in
his
Berlin
F
hrerbunker

Testament
of
Youth
is
a
heart
swollen
romance
of
WWI
nurse
Vera
Brittain
s
literary
memoirs
and
her
calls
for
pacifism

SBS
s
War
Week
included
no
actual
documentary
footage
like
that
of
Parer
s

Today
the
idea
of
an
authentic
representation
of
war
seems
less
appealing
to
audiences

Marvel
Studios
broke
box
office
records
all
over
the
world
with
its
fantasy
battle
and
sci
fi
war
film
Avengers
Endgame


Perhaps
too
much
reality
in
depicting
war
the
starkest
of
all
modern
realities
is
simply
unbearable

And
so
the
re
enchantment
of
war
comes
with
laser
battles
and
magic
gauntlets

Fact
versus
fiction
How
we
explore
war
on
film
has
sparked
heated
debates

One
argument
holds
the
true
horror
of
war
is
increasingly
obscured
by
technology
Hollywood
star
power
and
clever
marketing
campaigns

The
popular
HBO
documentary
television
miniseries
Band
of
Brothers
and
The
Pacific
caused
controversy
among
military
historians
who
accused
the
series
of
endorsing
war
nostalgia
making
the
audience
take
sides
and
actively
shaping
collective
modern
memory
through
re
enacted
combat
scenes

War
has
been
co
opted
as
an
entertainment
favourite
in
countries
all
across
the
world
allowing
audiences
to
think
of
it
as
a
metaphor
to
explore
issues
like
sexism
or
mortality

One
of
the
most
popular
South
Korean
war
films
Jang
Hoon
s
The
Front
Line
suggests
the
meaning
of
life
cannot
be
found
in
senseless
wars

The
Cave
a
war
documentary
by
Syrian
director
Feras
Fayyad
shows
how
a
group
of
female
doctors
in
Ghouta
struggle
with
systemic
sexism
while
tending
to
thousands
of
the
injured

Peter
Jackson
s
They
Shall
Not
Grow
Old
drew
almost
unanimous
critical
acclaim

Jackson
s
film
produces
a
modern
war
experience
by
enhancing
documentary
footage
of
the
first
world
war

We
see
the
real
faces
of
war
they
talk
they
smoke
makeshift
cigarettes
they
are
shellshocked
victims
of
their
time

Jackson
used
computerised
colouration
and
recordings
of
veteran
interviews
as
voiceovers

He
hired
forensic
lip
readers
to
superimpose
dialogue
on
the
previously
silent
combatants
voices

The
result
is
a
conflicting
truth
about
war
and
how
its
memories
grow
truer
and
more
real
before
our
eyes
and
in
our
ears
if
we
want
them
to
rather
than
feeling
safe
in
the
fact
those
bombastic
Hollywood
scenes
on
screen
can
never
become
our
reality

The
number
of
countries
experiencing
violent
conflict
is
the
highest

The

conflict

Many
of

are
being

exploited

Many
more
are
living
in
limbo
without
official
immigration
status
or
access
to
education
and
health
care

From
Afghanistan
to
Mali
to
South
Sudan
Yemen
and
beyond
warring
parties
are
flouting
one
of
the
most
basic
rules
of
war
the
protection
of
children

Children
have
become
frontline
targets

This
is
a
moral
crisis
of
our
age
We
must
never
accept
this
as
the
new
normal

To
better
monitor
prevent
and
end
attacks
against
children
the
United
Nations
Security
Council
has
identified
and
condemned
six
grave
violations
against
children
in
times
of
war
Killing
and
maiming
of
children
recruitment
or
use
of
children
in
armed
forces
and
armed
groups
attacks
on
schools
or
hospitals
rape
or
other
grave
sexual
violence
abduction
of
children
and
denial
of
humanitarian
access
for
children

Between
and
more
than
grave
violations
were
verified
against
children
committed
by
parties
to
conflict
in
more
than
conflict
situations
across
Africa
Asia
the
Middle
East
and
Latin
America

The
actual
number
is
undoubtedly
far
higher

Stop
attacks
on
children
Ultimately
children
need
peace
to
thrive

It
is
critical
for
children
that
efforts
to
end
today
s
seemingly
endless
armed
conflicts
are
redoubled

But
children
cannot
wait
for
protection
while
wars
continue
we
must
never
accept
attacks
against
children

More
than
years
since
the
adoption
of
the
Convention
on
the
Rights
of
the
Child
and
more
than
years
since
the
four
Geneva
Conventions
the
international
legal
bedrock
to
protect
civilians
in
war
it
is
time
to
say
Enough
Stop
attacks
on
children

the
change
agenda
What
we
can
all
do
to
make
change
happen
Citizens
everywhere
can
begin
by
not
averting
their
gaze
from
children
s
suffering
because
it
seems
too
distant
or
the
politics
of
conflict
too
complex

We
must
insist
to
national
and
international
leaders
that
protecting
children
during
armed
conflict
is
the
cornerstone
of
our
shared
humanity

We
must
demand
leadership
which
is
prepared
to
act
to
prevent
attacks
and
violence
against
children
trapped
in
war
zones

Governments
and
all
warring
parties
where
conflicts
rage
must
act
to
fulfil
their
obligations
to
protect
children
and
enable
access
to
specialized
response
services
for
children
affected
by
violence

Communities
in
conflict
affected
areas
must
be
supported
to
create
protective
environments
for
girls
and
boys

Governments
who
support
or
who
have
influence
over
warring
parties
must
use
all
their
influence
to
insist
children
are
protected
according
to
the
requirements
of
international
law

International
peace
and
security
institutions
such
as
the
United
Nations
Security
Council
and
regional
organizations
can
do
more
to
prioritize
the
safety
and
well
being
of
children
trapped
in
armed
conflicts

The
international
community
can
do
more
to
support
programmes
which
work
to
protect
children
from
violence
abuse
and
exploitation
and
deliver
the
services
needed
to
help
children
come
through
conflict
with
hope
for
a
better
future

By
protecting
children
from
attacks
in
armed
conflict
we
keep
hope
alive
we
begin
to
prepare
children
to
shape
peaceful
futures
for
themselves
and
their
countries

Acting
together
we
can
turn
back
this
deadly
new
normal
of
attacks
against
children
and
preserve
humanity

Children
cannot
wait

We
must
act
now

In
conflicts
around
the
world
civilians
continue
to
endure
the
devastating
consequences
of
the
use
of
explosive
weapons
in
populated
areas
EWIPA


When
used
in
cities
towns
and
villages
these
weapons
often
have
effects
well
beyond
their
targets

They
claim
countless
lives
and
limbs
cause
widespread
destruction
and
deprive
people
of
essential
civilian
services
such
as
water
and
sanitation
electricity
health
care
and
education

On
November
a
new
political
declaration
was
launched
Strengthening
the
Protection
of
Civilians
from
the
Humanitarian
Consequences
Arising
from
the
Use
of
Explosive

The
declaration
which
had
been
signed
by
states
by
November
sends
a
strong
signal
worldwide
that
harming
civilians
and
damaging
cities
is
not
a
reality
we
should
accept
by
committing
signatory
States
to
restrict
or
refrain
from
the
use
of
explosive
weapons
in
populated
areas

The
term
is
used
to
denote
any
action
which
is
practiced
mainly
by
psychological
methods
with
the
aim
of
evoking
a
planned
psychological
reaction
in
other
people

techniques
are
used
and
are
aimed
at
influencing
a
target
audience

value

emotions
motives
reasoning
or
behavior

It
is
used
to
induce
confessions
or
reinforce
attitudes
and
behaviors
favorable
to
the
originator
s
objectives
and
are
sometimes
combined
with
black
operations
or
false

tactics

It
is
also
used
to
destroy
the
morale
of
enemies
through
tactics
that
aim
to
depress
troops
psychological
states

Target
audiences
can
be
governments
organizations
groups
and
individuals
and
is
not
just
limited
to
soldiers

Civilians
of
foreign
territories
can
also
be
targeted
by
technology
and
media
so
as
to
cause
an
effect
on
the
government
of
their
country

Mass
communication
such
as
radio
allows
for
direct
communication
with
an
enemy
populace
and
therefore
has
been
used
in
many
efforts

Mosaic
of
Alexander
the
Great
on
his
campaign
against
the
Persian
Empire

Since
prehistoric
times
warlords
and
chiefs
have
recognized
the
importance
of
weakening
the
morale
of
their
opponents

In
the
Battle
of
Pelusium
BC
between
the
Persian
Empire
and
ancient
Egypt
the
Persian
forces
used
cats
and
other
animals
as
a
psychological
tactic
against
the
Egyptians
who
avoided
harming
cats
due
to
religious
belief
and
superstitions

Currying
favor
with
supporters
was
the
other
side
of
psychological
warfare
and
an
early
practitioner
of
this
was
Alexander
the
Great
who
successfully
conquered
large
parts
of
Europe
and
the
Middle
East
and
held
on
to
his
territorial
gains
by
co
opting
local
elites
into
the
Greek
administration
and
culture

Alexander
left
some
of
his
men
behind
in
each
conquered
city
to
introduce
Greek
culture
and
oppress
dissident
views

His
soldiers
were
paid
dowries
to
marry
locals
in
an
effort
to
encourage
assimilation

Genghis
Khan
leader
of
the
Mongolian
Empire
in
the
th
century
AD
employed
less
subtle
techniques

Defeating
the
will
of
the
enemy
before
having
to
attack
and
reaching
a
consented
settlement
was
preferable
to
facing
his
wrath

The
Mongol
generals
demanded
submission
to
the
Khan
and
threatened
the
initially
captured
villages
with
complete
destruction
if
they
refused
to
surrender

If
they
had
to
fight
to
take
the
settlement
the
Mongol
generals
fulfilled
their
threats
and
massacred
the
survivors

Tales
of
the
encroaching
horde
spread
to
the
next
villages
and
created
an
aura
of
insecurity
that
undermined
the
possibility
of
future
resistance

Genghis
Khan
also
employed
tactics
that
made
his
numbers
seem
greater
than
they
actually
were

During
night
operations
he
ordered
each
soldier
to
light
three
torches
at
dusk
to
give
the
illusion
of
an
overwhelming
army
and
deceive
and
intimidate
enemy
scouts

He
also
sometimes
had
objects
tied
to
the
tails
of
his
horses
so
that
riding
on
open
and
dry
fields
raised
a
cloud
of
dust
that
gave
the
enemy
the
impression
of
great
numbers

His
soldiers
used
arrows
specially
notched
to
whistle
as
they
flew
through
the
air
creating
a
terrifying
noise

Another
tactic
favored
by
the
Mongols
was
catapulting
severed
human
heads
over
city
walls
to
frighten
the
inhabitants
and
spread
disease
in
the
besieged
city
s
closed
confines

This
was
especially
used
by
the
later
which
Turko
Mongol
chieftain

The
Muslim
caliph
Omar
in
his
battles
against
the
Byzantine
Empire
sent
small
reinforcements
in
the
form
of
a
continuous
stream
giving
the
impression
that
a
large
force
would
accumulate
eventually
if
not
swiftly
dealt
with

During
the
early
Qin
dynasty
and
late
Eastern
Zhou
dynasty
in
st
century
AD
China
the
Empty
Fort
Strategy
was
used
to
trick
the
enemy
into
believing
that
an
empty
location
was
an
ambush
in
order
to
prevent
them
from
attacking
it
using
reverse
psychology

This
tactic
also
relied
on
luck
should
the
enemy
believe
that
the
location
is
a
threat
to
them

In
the
th
century
BCE
Greek
Bias
of
Priene
successfully
resisted
the
Lydian
king
Alyattes
by
fattening
up
a
pair
of
mules
and
driving
them
out
of
the
besieged
city

When
Alyattes
envoy
was
then
sent
to
Priene
Bias
had
piles
of
sand
covered
with
wheat
to
give
the
impression
of
plentiful
resources

This
ruse
appears
to
have
been
well
known
in
medieval
Europe
defenders
in
castles
or
towns
under
siege
would
throw
food
from
the
walls
to
show
besiegers
that
provisions
were
plentiful

A
famous
example
occurs
in
the
th
century
legend
of
Lady
Carcas
who
supposedly
persuaded
the
Franks
to
abandon
a
five
year
siege
by
this
means
and
gave
her
name
to
Carcassonne
as
a
result

During
the
Granada
War
Spanish
captain
Hern
n
P
rez
del
Pulgar
routinely
employed
psychological
tactics
as
part
of
his
guerrilla
actions
against
the
Emirate
of
Granada

In
infiltrating
the
city
by
night
with
a
small
retinue
of
soldiers
he
nailed
a
letter
of
challenge
on
the
main
mosque
and
set
fire
to
the
alcaicer
a
before
withdrawing

In
having
been
informed
about
the
pirate
attacks
previous
to
the
Battle
of
Manila
Spanish
captain
Juan
de
Salcedo
had
his
relief
force
return
to
the
city
by
night
while
playing
marching
music
and
carrying
torches
in
loose
formations
so
they
would
appear
to
be
a
much
larger
army
to
any
nearby
enemy

They
reached
the
city
unopposed

During
the
Attack
on
Marstrand
in
Peter
Tordenskjold

Lord
Bryce
led
the
commission
of
to
document
German
atrocities
committed
against
Belgian
civilians

The
start
of
modern
psychological
operations
in
war
is
generally
dated
to
World
War
I

By
that
point
Western
societies
were
increasingly
educated
and
urbanized
and
mass
media
was
available
in
the
form
of
large
circulation
newspapers
and
posters

It
was
also
possible
to
transmit
propaganda
to
the
enemy
via
the
use
of
airborne
leaflets
or
through
explosive
delivery
systems
like
modified
artillery
or
mortar
rounds

At
the
start
of
the
war
the
belligerents
especially
the
British
and
Germans
began
distributing
propaganda
both
domestically
and
on
the
Western
front

The
British
had
several
advantages
that
allowed
them
to
succeed
in
the
battle
for
world
opinion
they
had
one
of
the
world
s
most
reputable
news
systems
with
much
experience
in
international
and
cross
cultural
communication
and
they
controlled
much
of
the
undersea
communications
cable
system
then
in
operation

These
capabilities
were
easily
transitioned
to
the
task
of
warfare

The
British
also
had
a
diplomatic
service
that
maintained
good
relations
with
many
nations
around
the
world
in
contrast
to
the
reputation
of
the
German
services

While
German
attempts
to
foment
revolution
in
parts
of
the
British
Empire
such
as
Ireland
and
India
were
ineffective
extensive
experience
in
the
Middle
East
allowed
the
British
to
successfully
induce
the
Arabs
to
revolt
against
the
Ottoman
Empire

In
August
David
Lloyd
George
appointed
a
Member
of
Parliament
MP
Charles
Masterman
to
head
a
Propaganda
Agency
at
Wellington
House

A
distinguished
body
of
literary
talent
was
enlisted
for
the
task
with
its
members
including
Arthur
Conan
Doyle
Ford
Madox
Ford
G

K

Chesterton
Thomas
Hardy
Rudyard
Kipling
and
H

G

Wells

Over
pamphlets
were
published
during
the
war
and
distributed
to
neutral
countries
and
eventually
to
Germany

One
of
the
first
significant
publications
the
Report
on
Alleged
German
Outrages
of
had
a
great
effect
on
general
opinion
across
the
world

The
pamphlet
documented
atrocities
both
actual
and
alleged
committed
by
the
German
army
against
Belgian
civilians

A
Dutch
illustrator
Louis
Raemaekers
provided
the
highly
emotional
drawings
which
appeared
in
the
pamphlet

In
the
bureau
was
subsumed
into
the
new
Department
of
Information
and
branched
out
into
telegraph
communications
radio
newspapers
magazines
and
the
cinema

In
Viscount
Northcliffe
was
appointed
Director
of
Propaganda
in
Enemy
Countries

The
department
was
split
between
propaganda
against
Germany
organized
by
H
G
Wells
and
propaganda
against
the
Austro
Hungarian
Empire
supervised
by
Wickham
Steed
and
Robert
William
Seton
Watson
the
attempts
of
the
latter
focused
on
the
lack
of
ethnic
cohesion
in
the
Empire
and
stoked
the
grievances
of
minorities
such
as
the
Croats
and
Slovenes

It
had
a
significant
effect
on
the
final
collapse
of
the
Austro
Hungarian
Army
at
the
Battle
of
Vittorio
Veneto

Aerial
leaflets
were
dropped
over
German
trenches
containing
postcards
from
prisoners
of
war
detailing
their
humane
conditions
surrender
notices
and
general
propaganda
against
the
Kaiser
and
the
German
generals

By
the
end
of
the
war
MI
b
had
distributed
almost
million
leaflets

The
Germans
began
shooting
the
leaflet
dropping
pilots
prompting
the
British
to
develop
unmanned
leaflet
balloons
that
drifted
across
no
man
s
land

At
least
one
in
seven
of
these
leaflets
were
not
handed
in
by
the
soldiers
to
their
superiors
despite
severe
penalties
for
that
offence

Even
General
Hindenburg
admitted
that
Unsuspectingly
many
thousands
consumed
the
poison
and
POWs
admitted
to
being
disillusioned
by
the
propaganda
leaflets
that
depicted
the
use
of
German
troops
as
mere
cannon
fodder

In
the
British
began
airdropping
a
regular
leaflet
newspaper
Le
Courrier
de
l
Air
for
civilians
in
German
occupied
France
and
Belgium

At
the
start
of
the
war
the
French
government
took
control
of
the
media
to
suppress
negative
coverage

Only
in
with
the
establishment
of
the
Maison
de
la
Presse
did
they
begin
to
use
similar
tactics
for
the
purpose
of
psychological
warfare

One
of
its
sections
was
the
Service
de
la
Propagande
a
rienne
Aerial
Propaganda
Service
headed
by
Professor
Tonnelat
and
Jean
Jacques
Waltz
an
Alsatian
artist
code
named
Hansi


The
French
tended
to
distribute
leaflets
of
images
only
although
the
full
publication
of
US
President
Woodrow
Wilson
s
Fourteen
Points
which
had
been
heavily
edited
in
the
German
newspapers
was
distributed
via
airborne
leaflets
by
the
French

The
Central
Powers
were
slow
to
use
these
techniques
however
at
the
start
of
the
war
the
Germans
succeeded
in
inducing
the
Sultan
of
the
Ottoman
Empire
to
declare
holy
war
or
Jihad
against
the
Western
infidels

They
also
attempted
to
foment
rebellion
against
the
British
Empire
in
places
as
far
afield
as
Ireland
Afghanistan
and
India

The
Germans
greatest
success
was
in
giving
the
Russian
revolutionary
Lenin
free
transit
on
a
sealed
train
from
Switzerland
to
Finland
after
the
overthrow
of
the
Tsar

This
soon
paid
off
when
the
Bolshevik
Revolution
took
Russia
out
of
the
war

World
War
II
edit
Adolf
Hitler
was
greatly
influenced
by
the
psychological
tactics
of
warfare
the
British
had
employed
during
World
War
I
and
attributed
the
defeat
of
Germany
to
the
effects
this
propaganda
had
on
the
soldiers

He
became
committed
to
the
use
of
mass
propaganda
to
influence
the
minds
of
the
German
population
in
the
decades
to
come

By
calling
his
movement
The
Third
Reich
he
was
able
to
convince
many
civilians
that
his
cause
was
not
just
a
fad
but
the
way
of
their
future

Joseph
Goebbels
was
appointed
as
Propaganda
Minister
when
Hitler
came
to
power
in
and
he
portrayed
Hitler
as
a
messianic
figure
for
the
redemption
of
Germany

Hitler
also
coupled
this
with
the
resonating
projections
of
his
orations
for
effect

Germany
s
Fall
Gr
n
plan
of
invasion
of
Czechoslovakia
had
a
large
part
dealing
with
psychological
warfare
aimed
both
at
the
Czechoslovak
civilians
and
government
as
well
as
crucially
at
Czechoslovakia
s
allies

It
became
successful
to
the
point
that
Germany
gained
support
of
UK
and
France
through
appeasement
to
occupy
Czechoslovakia
without
having
to
fight
an
all
out
war
sustaining
only
minimum
losses
in
covert
war
before
the
Munich
Agreement

At
the
start
of
the
Second
World
War
the
British
set
up
the
Political
Warfare
Executive
to
produce
and
distribute
propaganda

Through
the
use
of
powerful
transmitters
broadcasts
could
be
made
across
Europe

Sefton
Delmer
managed
a
successful
black
propaganda
campaign
through
several
radio
stations
which
were
designed
to
be
popular
with
German
troops
while
at
the
same
time
introducing
news
material
that
would
weaken
their
morale
under
a
veneer
of
authenticity

British
Prime
Minister
Winston
Churchill
made
use
of
radio
broadcasts
for
propaganda
against
the
Germans

Churchill
favoured
deception
he
said
In
wartime
truth
is
so
precious
that
she
should
always
be
attended
by
a
bodyguard
of
lies

During
World
War
II
the
British
made
extensive
use
of
deception
developing
many
new
techniques
and
theories

The
main
protagonists
at
this
time
were
A
Force
set
up
in
under
Dudley
Clarke
and
the
London
Controlling
Section
chartered
in
under
the
control
of
John
Bevan

Clarke
pioneered
many
of
the
strategies
of
military
deception

His
ideas
for
combining
fictional
orders
of
battle
visual
deception
and
double
agents
helped
define
Allied
deception
strategy
during
the
war
for
which
he
has
been
referred
to
as
the
greatest
British
deceiver
of
WW


During
the
lead
up
to
the
Allied
invasion
of
Normandy
many
new
tactics
in
psychological
warfare
were
devised

The
plan
for
Operation
Bodyguard
set
out
a
general
strategy
to
mislead
German
high
command
as
to
the
date
and
location
of
the
invasion
which
was
obviously
going
to
happen

Planning
began
in
under
the
auspices
of
the
London
Controlling
Section
LCS


A
draft
strategy
referred
to
as
Plan
Jael
was
presented
to
Allied
high
command
at
the
Tehran
Conference

Operation
Fortitude
was
intended
to
convince
the
Germans
of
a
greater
Allied
military
strength
than
was
the
case
through
fictional
field
armies
faked
operations
to
prepare
the
ground
for
invasion
and
leaked
misinformation
about
the
Allied
order
of
battle
and
war
plans

Elaborate
naval
deceptions
Operations
Glimmer
Taxable
and
Big
Drum
were
undertaken
in
the
English
Channel

Small
ships
and
aircraft
simulated
invasion
fleets
lying
off
Pas
de
Calais
Cap
d
Antifer
and
the
western
flank
of
the
real
invasion
force

At
the
same
time
Operation
Titanic
involved
the
RAF
dropping
fake
paratroopers
to
the
east
and
west
of
the
Normandy
landings

IMG
A
dummy
Sherman
tank
used
to
deceive
the
Germans

The
deceptions
were
implemented
with
the
use
of
double
agents
radio
traffic
and
visual
deception

The
British
Double
Cross
anti
espionage
operation
had
proven
very
successful
from
the
outset
of
the
war
and
the
LCS
was
able
to
use
double
agents
to
send
back
misleading
information
about
Allied
invasion
plans

The
use
of
visual
deception
including
mock
tanks
and
other
military
hardware
had
been
developed
during
the
North
Africa
campaign

Mock
hardware
was
created
for
Bodyguard
in
particular
dummy
landing
craft
were
stockpiled
to
give
the
impression
that
the
invasion
would
take
place
near
Calais

The
Operation
was
a
strategic
success
and
the
Normandy
landings
caught
German
defences
unawares

Continuing
deception
portraying
the
landings
as
a
diversion
from
a
forthcoming
main
invasion
in
the
Calais
region
led
Hitler
into
delaying
transferring
forces
from
Calais
to
the
real
battleground
for
nearly
seven
weeks

The
United
States
ran
an
extensive
program
of
psychological
warfare
during
the
Vietnam
War

The
Phoenix
Program
had
the
dual
aim
of
assassinating
National
Liberation
Front
of
South
Vietnam
NLF
or
Viet
Cong
personnel
and
terrorizing
any
potential
sympathizers
or
passive
supporters

During
the
Phoenix
Program
over
NLF
supporters
were
killed

The
United
States
also
used
tapes
of
distorted
human
sounds
and
played
them
during
the
night
making
the
Vietnamese
soldiers
think
that
the
dead
were
back
for
revenge

The
Vietcong
and
their
forces
also
used
a
program
of
psychological
warfare
during
this
war

made
English

broadcasts
for
North

directed
at
United

troops

During
the
Vietnam
War
Ng
became
famous
among
US
soldiers
for
her
propaganda
broadcasts
on
Radio
Hanoi

Her
scripts
were
written
by
the
North
Vietnamese
Army
and
were
intended
to
frighten
and
shame
the
soldiers
into
leaving
their
posts

She
made
three
broadcasts
a
day
reading
a
list
of
newly
killed
or
imprisoned
Americans
and
playing
popular
US
anti
war
songs
in
an
effort

of
nostalgia
and
homesickness
attempting
to
persuade
US
GIs
that
the
US
involvement
in
the
Vietnam
War
was
unjust
and
immoral

A
typical
broadcast
began
as
follows

me
that

to
be

found
that
over
five
years
people
associated

Most
modern
uses
of
the
term
psychological
warfare
refer
to
the
following
military
methods
Demoralization
Distributing
pamphlets
that
encourage
desertion
or
supply
instructions
on
how
to
surrender

Shock
and
awe
military

Projecting
repetitive
and

noises
and
music
for

at

under

Nifty

Propaganda
radio

as

Renaming

after

in
the
Vietnam
War

False
flag
events

Terrorism
The
threat
of
chemical
weapons

Information
warfare

Most
of
these
techniques
were
developed
during
World
War
II
or
earlier
and
have
been
used
to
some
degree
in
every
conflict
since

Daniel
Lerner
was
in
the
OSS
the
predecessor
to
the
American
CIA
and
in
his
book
attempts
to
analyze
how
effective
the
various
strategies
were

He
concludes
that
there
is
little
evidence
that
any
of
them
were
dramatically
successful
except
perhaps
surrender
instructions
over
loudspeakers
when
victory
was
imminent

Measuring
the
success
or
failure
of
psychological
warfare
is
very
hard
as
the
conditions
are
very
far
from
being
a
controlled
experiment

Lerner
also
divides
psychological
warfare
operations
into
three
categories
page
needed
White
propaganda
omissions
and
emphasis
Truthful
and
not
strongly
biased
where
the
source
of
information
is
acknowledged

Grey
propaganda
omissions
emphasis
and
racial
ethnic
religious
bias
Largely
truthful
containing
no
information
that
can
be
proven
wrong
the
source
is
not
identified

Black
propaganda
commissions
of
falsification
Inherently
deceitful
information
given
in
the
product
is
attributed
to
a
source
that
was
not
responsible
for
its
creation

Lerner
says
grey
and
black
operations
ultimately
have
a
heavy
cost
in
that
the
target
population
sooner
or
later
recognizes
them
as
propaganda
and
discredits
the
source

He
writes
This
is
one
of
the
few
dogmas
advanced
by
Sykewarriors
that
is
likely
to
endure
as
an
axiom
of
propaganda
Credibility
is
a
condition
of
persuasion

Before
you
can
make
a
man
do
as
you
say
you
must
make
him
believe
what
you
say

Consistent
with
this
idea
the
Allied
strategy
in
World
War
II
was
predominantly
one
of
truth
with
certain
exceptions

In
Propaganda
The
Formation
of
Men
s
Attitudes
Jacques
Ellul
discusses
psychological
warfare
as
a
common
peace
policy
practice
between
nations
as
a
form
of
indirect
aggression

This
type
of
propaganda
drains
the
public
opinion
of
an
opposing
regime
by
stripping
away
its
power
on
public
opinion

This
form
of
aggression
is
hard
to
defend
against
because
no
international
court
of
justice
is
capable
of
protecting
against
psychological
aggression
since
it
cannot
be
legally
adjudicated

Here
the
propagandists
is
sic
dealing
with
a
foreign
adversary
whose
morale
he
seeks
to
destroy
by
psychological
means
so
that
the
opponent
begins

the
validity
of
his

According
to
U
S

military
analysts
attacking
the
enemy
s
mind
is
an
important
element
of
the
People
s
Republic
of
China
s
military
strategy

This
type
of
warfare
is
rooted
in
the
Chinese
Stratagems
outlined
by
Sun
Tzu
in
The
Art
of
War
and
Thirty
Six
Stratagems

In
its
dealings
with
its
rivals
China
is
expected
to
utilize
Marxism
to
mobilize
communist
loyalists
as
well
as
flex
its
economic
and
military
muscle
to
persuade
other
nations
to
act
in
the
Chinese
government
s
interests

The
Chinese
government
also
tries
to
control
the
media
to
keep
a
tight
hold
on
propaganda
efforts
for
its
people

The
Chinese
government
also
utilizes
cognitive
warfare
against
Taiwan

The
center
is
subordinate
to
the
Cyber

Information
Domain
Service
branch
alongside
multiple
IT
and
Electronic
Warfare
battalions
and
consists
of

One
project
of

German
PSYOP
forces
is
the
radio
station

Another
is

Afghanistan
where
German
soldiers
serve
with

Iran
edit
The
Iranian
government
had
an
operation
program
to
use
the
FIFA
World
Cup
as
a
psyop
against
concurrent
people
s
protests

Israel
edit
The
Israeli
government
and
its
military
make
use
of
psychological
warfare

In
Israeli
newspaper
Haaretz
revealed
that
Abu
Ali
Express
a
popular
news
page
on
Telegram
and
Twitter
purportedly
dedicated
to
Arab
affairs
was
actually
run
by
a
Jewish
Israeli
paid
consultant
to
the
Israel
Defense
Forces

The
IDF
s
psyops
account
had
been
the
source
of
a
number
of
noteworthy
reports
that
were
afterwards
cited
by
the
Israeli
and
international
media

Abu
Ali
Express
was
for
example
the
source
for
the
report
that
Qatari
funds
were
entering
the
Gaza
Strip
in
suitcases

The
British
were
one
of
the
first
major
military
powers
to
use
psychological
warfare
in
the
First
and
Second
World
Wars

In
the
current
British
Armed
Forces
PsyOps
are
handled
by
the
tri
service
Psychological
Operations
Group

See
also
MI
and
Secret
Intelligence
Service


The
Psychological
Operations
Group
comprises
over
personnel
approximately
from
the
regular
Armed
Services
and
from
the
Reserves

The
Group
supports
deployed
commanders
in
the
provision
of
psychological
operations
in
operational
and
tactical
environments

The
Group
was
established
immediately
after
the
Gulf
War
has
since
grown
significantly
in
size
to
meet
operational
requirements
and
since
has
been
one
of
the
sub
units
of
the
th
Brigade
formerly
called
the
Security
Assistance
Group

In
June
NSA
files
published
by
Glenn
Greenwald
revealed
details
of
the
JTRIG
group
at
British
intelligence
agency
GCHQ
covertly
manipulating
online
communities

This
is
in
line
with
JTRIG
s
goal
to
destroy
deny
degrade
and
disrupt
enemies
by
discrediting
them
planting
misinformation
and
shutting
down
their
communications

In
March
it
emerged
that
the
Defence
Science
and
Technology
Laboratory
DSTL
of
the
UK
s
Ministry
of
Defence
MoD
is
tendering
to
arms
companies
and
universities
for
M
worth
of
assistance
under
a
project
to
develop
new
methods
of
psychological
warfare

project

The
term
psychological
warfare
is
believed
to
have
migrated
from
Germany
to
the
United
States
in


During
World
War
II
the
United
States
Joint
Chiefs
of
Staff
defined
psychological
warfare
broadly
stating
Psychological
warfare
employs
any
weapon
to
influence
the
mind
of
the
enemy

The
weapons
are
psychological
only
in
the
effect
they
produce
and
not
because
of
the
weapons
themselves

The
U
S

Department
of
Defense
currently
defines
psychological
warfare
as
The
planned
use
of
propaganda
and
other
psychological
actions
having
the
primary
purpose
of
influencing
the
opinions
emotions
attitudes
and
behavior
of
hostile
foreign
groups
in
such
a
way
as
to
support
the
achievement
of
national
objectives

This
definition
indicates
that
a
critical
element
of
the
U
S

psychological
operations
capabilities
includes
propaganda
and
by
extension
counterpropaganda

Joint
Publication
establishes
specific
policy
to
use
public
affairs
mediums
to
counter
propaganda
from
foreign
origins

The
purpose
of
United
States
psychological
operations
is
to
induce
or
reinforce
attitudes
and
behaviors
favorable
to
US
objectives

The
Special
Activities
Center
SAC
is
a
division
of
the
Central
Intelligence
Agency
s
National
Clandestine
Service
responsible
for
Covert
Action
and
Special
Activities


These
special
activities
include
covert
political
influence
which
includes
psychological
operations
and
paramilitary
operations

SAC
s
political
influence
group
is
the
only
US
unit
allowed
to
conduct
these
operations
covertly
and
is
considered
the
primary
unit
in
this
area

Dedicated
psychological
operations
units
exist
in
the
United
States
Army
and
United
States
Marine
Corps

The
United
States
Navy
and
the
rd
Special
Operations
Wing
of
the
United
States
Air
Force
also
plans
and
executes
limited
PSYOP
missions

United
States
PSYOP
units
and
soldiers
of
all
branches
of
the
military
are
prohibited
by
law
from
targeting
U
S

citizens
with
PSYOP
within
the
borders
of
the
United
States
Executive
Order
S
DOD
Directive
S


and
National
Security
Decision
Directive


While
United
States
Army
PSYOP
units
may
offer
non
PSYOP
support
to
domestic
military
missions
they
can
only
target
foreign
audiences

A
U
S

Army
field
manual
released
in
January
states
that
Inform
and
Influence
Activities
are
critical
for
describing
directing
and
leading
military
operations

Several
Army
Division
leadership
staff
are
assigned
to
planning
integration
and
synchronization
of
designated
information
related
capabilities

In
September
an
audit
of
covert
information
warfare
took
place
after
social

companies
identified
a
suspected
U

operation
