   War is an intense armed conflict^[a] between states, governments,
   societies, or paramilitary groups such as mercenaries, insurgents, and
   militias. It is generally characterized by extreme violence, destruction,
   and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. Warfare refers
   to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars
   in general.^[2] Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely
   legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other
   non-combatant suffering and casualties.
   While some war studies scholars consider war a universal and ancestral
   aspect of human nature,^[3] others argue it is a result of specific

Etymology
   [IMG]Mural of War (1896), by Gari Melchers

   The earliest evidence of prehistoric warfare is a Mesolithic cemetery in
   Jebel Sahaba, which has been determined to be about 13,400 years old.^[6]
--
   Since the rise of the state some 5,000 years ago,^[8] military activity
   has occurred over much of the globe. Estimates for total deaths due to war
   vary wildly. For the period 3000 BCE until 1991, estimates range from
   145 million to 2 billion.^[9] In one estimate, primitive warfare prior to
   3000 BCE has been thought to have claimed 400 million victims based on the
--
   diseases in the 20th century.^[11]
   In War Before Civilization, Lawrence H. Keeley, a professor at the
   University of Illinois, says approximately 90–95% of known societies
   throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare,^[12] and many
   fought constantly.^[13]
   Keeley describes several styles of primitive combat such as small raids,
   large raids, and massacres. All of these forms of warfare were used by
   primitive societies, a finding supported by other researchers.^[14] Keeley
   explains that early war raids were not well organized, as the participants
   did not have any formal training. Scarcity of resources meant defensive
--
   a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty.'"^[16]
   The invention of gunpowder, and its eventual use in warfare, together with
   the acceleration of technological advances have fomented major changes to
   war itself.

   In Western Europe, since the late 18th century, more than 150 conflicts
   and about 600 battles have taken place.^[17] During the 20th century, war
   resulted in a dramatic intensification of the pace of social changes, and
   was a crucial catalyst for the growth of left-wing politics.^[18]

   In 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of
   modern warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences and
   costs of the newly developed atom bomb, Albert Einstein famously stated,
   "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War
   IV will be fought with sticks and stones."^[19]
   Mao Zedong urged the socialist camp not to fear nuclear war with the
   United States since, even if "half of mankind died, the other half would

   would become socialist."^[20]
   A distinctive feature of war since 1945 is that combat has largely been a
   matter of civil wars and insurgencies.^[21] The major exceptions were the
   Korean War, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Iran–Iraq War, the Gulf
   War, the Eritrean–Ethiopian War, and the Russo-Ukrainian War.

Types of warfare
   Main article: Types of war
     * Asymmetric warfare is the methods used in conflicts between
       belligerents of drastically different levels of military capability or
       size.^[23]
     * Biological warfare, or germ warfare, is the use of biological
       infectious agents or toxins such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi
--
       pathogens.
     * Chemical warfare involves the use of weaponized chemicals in combat.
       Poison gas as a chemical weapon was principally used during World War
       I, and resulted in over a million estimated casualties, including more
       than 100,000 civilians.^[26]
     * Cold warfare is an intense international rivalry without direct
       military conflict, but with a sustained threat of it, including high

       may involve active conflicts by indirect means, such as economic
       warfare, political warfare, covert operations, espionage,
       cyberwarfare, or proxy wars.
     * Conventional warfare is a form of warfare between states in which
       nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons are not used or see limited
       deployment.
     * Cyberwarfare involves the actions by a nation-state or international
       organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's
--
       claims against the incumbent regime.
     * Information warfare is the application of destructive force on a large
       scale against information assets and systems, against the computers

     * Nuclear warfare is warfare in which nuclear weapons are the primary,
       or a major, method of achieving capitulation.
     * Total war is warfare by any means possible, disregarding the laws of
       war, placing no limits on legitimate military targets, using weapons
       and tactics resulting in significant civilian casualties, or demanding
       a war effort requiring significant sacrifices by the friendly civilian
       population.
     * Unconventional warfare, the opposite of conventional warfare, is an
       attempt to achieve military victory through acquiescence,

   Entities contemplating going to war and entities considering whether to
   end a war may formulate war aims as an evaluation/propaganda tool. War
   aims may stand as a proxy for national-military resolve.^[28]
  Definition
   Fried defines war aims as "the desired territorial, economic, military or
   other benefits expected following successful conclusion of a war".^[29]
  Classification
   Tangible/intangible aims:
     * Tangible war aims may involve (for example) the acquisition of
       territory (as in the German goal of Lebensraum in the first half of
       the 20th century) or the recognition of economic concessions (as in
       the Anglo-Dutch Wars).
     * Intangible war aims – like the accumulation of credibility or
       reputation^[30] – may have more tangible expression ("conquest
--
   Explicit/implicit aims:
     * Explicit war aims may involve published policy decisions.
     * Implicit war aims^[32] can take the form of minutes of discussion,
       memoranda and instructions.^[33]
   Positive/negative aims:
     * "Positive war aims" cover tangible outcomes.
     * "Negative war aims" forestall or prevent undesired outcomes.^[34]
   War aims can change in the course of conflict and may eventually morph
   into "peace conditions"^[35] – the minimal conditions under which a state
   may cease to wage a particular war.

--
   Throughout the course of human history, the average number of people dying
   from war has fluctuated relatively little, being about 1 to 10 people
   dying per 100,000. However, major wars over shorter periods have resulted
   in much higher casualty rates, with 100–200 casualties per 100,000 over a
   few years. While conventional wisdom holds that casualties have increased
   in recent times due to technological improvements in warfare, this is not
   generally true. For instance, the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) had about
   the same number of casualties per capita as World War I, although it was
   higher during World War II (WWII). That said, overall the number of
   casualties from war has not significantly increased in recent times. Quite
   to the contrary, on a global scale the time since WWII has been unusually

  Largest by death toll
   Main articles: List of wars by death toll, Outline of war § Wars, and
   Casualty recording
   The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths
   since its start, is World War II, from 1939 to 1945, with 70–85 million
   deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests^[39] at up to 60 million. As
   concerns a belligerent's losses in proportion to its prewar population,
   the most destructive war in modern history may have been the Paraguayan
   War (see Paraguayan War casualties). In 2013 war resulted in 31,000
   deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990.^[40] War usually results in
   significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease
   in social spending, famine, large-scale emigration from the war zone, and
   often the mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilians.^[41]^[42]^[43]
   For instance, of the nine million people who were on the territory of the
   Byelorussian SSR in 1941, some 1.6 million were killed by the Germans in
   actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war,
   500,000 Jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority
   of whom were unarmed civilians).^[44] Another byproduct of some wars is
   the prevalence of propaganda by some or all parties in the conflict,^[45]
   and increased revenues by weapons manufacturers.^[46]
   Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been
   waged in the last century. These are the two World Wars, followed by the
   Second Sino-Japanese War (which is sometimes considered part of World War
   II, or as overlapping). Most of the others involved China or neighboring
   peoples. The death toll of World War II, being over 60 million, surpasses
   all other war-death-tolls.^[47]

  On military personnel
   Military personnel subject to combat in war often suffer mental and
   physical injuries, including depression, posttraumatic stress disorder,
   disease, injury, and death.

   Additionally, it has been estimated anywhere from 18% to 54% of Vietnam
   war veterans suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder.^[60]
   Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white American males aged 13 to 43
   died in the American Civil War, including about 6% in the North and
   approximately 18% in the South.^[61] The war remains the deadliest
   conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000 military
   personnel. United States military casualties of war since 1775 have
   totaled over two million. Of the 60 million European military personnel
   who were mobilized in World War I, 8 million were killed, 7 million were
   permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured.^[62]

  On civilians

   [IMG]Les Grandes Misères de la guerre depict the destruction unleashed on
   civilians during the Thirty Years' War.
   Most wars have resulted in significant loss of life, along with
   destruction of infrastructure and resources (which may lead to famine,
   disease, and death in the civilian population). During the Thirty Years'
   War in Europe, the population of the Holy Roman Empire was reduced by 15
   to 40 percent.^[67]^[68] Civilians in war zones may also be subject to war
   atrocities such as genocide, while survivors may suffer the psychological
   aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war. War also results in
   lower quality of life and worse health outcomes. A medium-sized conflict

   reparations to the victorious nations. In certain cases, land is ceded to

   Typically, war becomes intertwined with the economy and many wars are
   partially or entirely based on economic reasons. Following World War II,
   consensus opinion for many years amongst economists and historians was
   that war can stimulate a country's economy as evidenced by the U.S's
   emergence from the Great Depression,^[74] though modern economic analysis
   has thrown significant doubt on these views. In most cases, such as the
   wars of Louis XIV, the Franco-Prussian War, and World War I, warfare
   primarily results in damage to the economy of the countries involved. For
   example, Russia's involvement in World War I took such a toll on the
   Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the
   start of the Russian Revolution of 1917.^[75]
    World War II

   World War II was the most financially costly conflict in history; its
   belligerents cumulatively spent about a trillion U.S. dollars on the war
   effort (as adjusted to 1940 prices).^[76]^[77] The Great Depression of the
   1930s ended as nations increased their production of war materials.^[78]

   There are many theories about the motivations for war, but no consensus
   about which are most common.^[81] Military theorist Carl von Clausewitz
   said, "Every age has its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and
   its own peculiar preconceptions."^[82]
  Psychoanalytic
   Dutch psychoanalyst Joost Meerloo held that, "War is often...a mass
   discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of
--
   ideologies. By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local
   society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare.
   The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of Melanie Klein,
   thought war was the paranoid or projective "elaboration" of mourning.^[85]
   Fornari thought war and violence develop out of our "love need": our wish
   to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely
   our early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the
   sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as
   the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for
   their country, to give over their bodies to their nation.
   Despite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for self-sacrifice
   for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, few wars have
   originated from a desire for war among the general populace.^[86] Far more
   often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its
   rulers. One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by
   Maurice Walsh.^[87] He argues the general populace is more neutral towards
   war and wars occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard
   for human life are placed into power. War is caused by leaders who seek
   war such as Napoleon and Hitler. Such leaders most often come to power in
   times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then
   leads the nation to war.
     Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in
     England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is

   (Luzerner Schilling)
   Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are
   two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging in or after the
   Mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater
   population density and competition over resources; the other sees human
   warfare as a more ancient practice derived from common animal tendencies,
   such as territoriality and sexual competition.^[89]
   The latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found in

   War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive

   natural resources and for wealth. War has also been linked to economic
   development by economic historians and development economists studying

   Main article: Marxist explanations of warfare
   The Marxist theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states all modern

   (imperialist) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of
   capitalism. Marxist economists Karl Kautsky, Rosa Luxemburg, Rudolf

   populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or

   Geoffrey Parker argues that what distinguishes the "Western way of war"
   based in Western Europe chiefly allows historians to explain its
   extraordinary success in conquering most of the world after 1500:
     The Western way of war rests upon five principal foundations:
     technology, discipline, a highly aggressive military tradition, a
     remarkable capacity to innovate and to respond rapidly to the innovation
     of others and – from about 1500 onward – a unique system of war finance.
     The combination of all five provided a formula for military
     success....The outcome of wars has been determined less by technology,
     then by better war plans, the achievement of surprise, greater economic
     strength, and above all superior discipline.^[117]

   Rationalism is an international relations theory or framework. Rationalism

   that states or international actors are rational, seek the best possible
   outcomes for themselves, and desire to avoid the costs of war.^[119] Under
   one game theory approach, rationalist theories posit all actors can
   bargain, would be better off if war did not occur, and likewise seek to
   understand why war nonetheless reoccurs. Under another rationalist game
   theory without bargaining, the peace war game, optimal strategies can
   still be found that depend upon number of iterations played. In
   "Rationalist Explanations for War", James Fearon examined three
   rationalist explanations for why some countries engage in war:
     * Issue indivisibilities

     * Commitment problems^[119]
   "Issue indivisibility" occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by
   bargaining, because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be

   countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not
   agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of
   state's victory or loss. For instance, Geoffrey Blainey argues that war is
   a result of miscalculation of strength. He cites historical examples of
   war and demonstrates, "war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic crisis
   which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting estimates of

   Within the rationalist tradition, some theorists have suggested that
   individuals engaged in war suffer a normal level of cognitive bias,^[122]
   but are still "as rational as you and me".^[123] According to philosopher

   The rationalist theory focused around bargaining is currently under
   debate. The Iraq War proved to be an anomaly that undercuts the validity
   of applying rationalist theory to some wars.^[126]
  Political science
   The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by Lewis Fry Richardson
   following World War I. More recent databases of wars and armed conflict
   have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project, Peter Brecke and the
   Uppsala Conflict Data Program.^[127]
   The following subsections consider causes of war from system, societal,
   and individual levels of analysis. This kind of division was first
   proposed by Kenneth Waltz in Man, the State, and War and has been often
   used by political scientists since then.^[128]^: 143 
--
    1. Balance of power theory: States have the goal of preventing a single
       state from becoming a hegemon, and war is the result of the would-be
       hegemon's persistent attempts at power acquisition. In this view, an
       international system with more equal distribution of power is more
       stable, and "movements toward unipolarity are
       destabilizing."^[128]^: 147  However, evidence has shown power
       polarity is not actually a major factor in the occurrence of
       wars.^[128]^: 147–48 
    2. Power transition theory: Hegemons impose stabilizing conditions on the
       world order, but they eventually decline, and war occurs when a
       declining hegemon is challenged by another rising power or aims to
       preemptively suppress them.^[128]^: 148  On this view, unlike for
       balance-of-power theory, wars become more probable when power is more

   The morality of war has been the subject of debate for thousands of
   years.^[131]
   The two principal aspects of ethics in war, according to the just war
   theory, are jus ad bellum and jus in bello.^[132]
   Jus ad bellum (right to war), dictates which unfriendly acts and
   circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another
   nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war:
   first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it
   must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit
--
   fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success;
   fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought
   must be proportional to means being used.^[133]^[134]
--
   driven out by starvation. These intentions were part of the 'General Plan
   East'." – The Oxford Companion to World War II.^[135]
   Jus in bello (right in war), is the set of ethical rules when conducting
   war. The two main principles are proportionality and discrimination.
   Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally
--
   principle of discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a
   war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is
   permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not.^[136] Failure to
   follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the
   just-war-belligerent.^[137]
   The just war theory was foundational in the creation of the United Nations
   and in international law's regulations on legitimate war.^[131]

Limiting and stopping
   [IMG]Anti-war rally in Washington, D.C., 15 March 2003

   indiscriminately at the destruction of entire cities of extensive areas

   merits unequivocal and unhesitating condemnation."^[139]
   Anti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century,
   including, most prominently, World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam
   War. In the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred in
   response to the United States invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. Protests
   opposing the War in Afghanistan occurred in Europe, Asia, and the United
   States.

   ArticleVocabulary
   War is generally defined as violent conflict between states or nations.
   Nations go to war for a variety of reasons. It has been argued that a
   nation will go to war if the benefits of war are deemed to outweigh the
   disadvantages, and if there is a sense that there is not another mutually
   agreeable solution. More specifically, some have argued that wars are
   fought primarily for economic, religious, and political reasons. Others
   have claimed that most wars today are fought for ideological reasons.
   In the United States, the legal power to declare war is vested in
   Congress; however, the president is the commander-in-chief of the
   military, so he or she holds power to conduct a war once it has been
   declared. In many instances, the president has used military force without
   declaring war.
   Just War Theory
   In Western tradition, there is a sense that the reasons for war must be
   just. This idea dates back to ancient times, but is most clearly traced to
   the writings of St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas. They attempted to
   justify war, and reconcile it with the Christian belief that taking a
   human life is wrong.
   To Aquinas, a war must be just in both the reasons for going to war and
   how war is fought. Reasons for going to war—jus ad bellum—are just if (1)
   war is declared by an appropriate authority; (2) the war is waged for a
   just cause; and (3) the war is waged for just intentions. An appropriate
   authority is a proper, governing authority. A “just cause” may include
--
   addition, (4) there must be a reasonable chance of success; (5) the good
   that will be achieved must outweigh the bad; and (6) war must be a last
   resort.
   Once just reasons for going to war are satisfied, conduct in the war—jus
   in bello—must be just as well. Just conduct in a war means that it must be
   specific and proportional. That is, noncombatants and civilians must not
--
   used, and harms must be proportionate to the goal sought.
   Law of War
   Some of the just war theories have been adopted as parts of international
   agreements and incorporated into the law of war (i.e., international law)
   that regulates the resort to armed force, the conduct of hostilities, and
   the protection of war victims.
   The Geneva Conventions, for example, are a series of international
   treaties that are designed to protect noncombatants, civilians, and
   prisoners of war. The treaties were negotiated in Geneva, Switzerland,
   between 1864 and 1977. The First and Second Geneva Conventions apply to
--
   protecting the wounded and sick, as well as medical personnel and
   transports. The Third Geneva Convention applies to prisoners of war, and
   the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to people in occupied territories.

   In all ages war has been an important topic of analysis. In the latter
   part of the 20th century, in the aftermath of two World Wars and in the
   shadow of nuclear, biological, and chemical holocaust, more was written on
   the subject than ever before. Endeavours to understand the nature of war,
   to formulate some theory of its causes, conduct, and prevention, are of
   great importance, for theory shapes human expectations and determines
   human behaviour. The various schools of theorists are generally aware of
   the profound influence they can exercise upon life, and their writings

Evolution of theories of war

   1815, 19th-century aquatint, after a painting by William Heath.(more)
   Reflecting changes in the international system, theories of war have
   passed through several phases in the course of the past three centuries.
   After the ending of the wars of religion, about the middle of the 17th
   century, wars were fought for the interests of individual sovereigns and
   were limited both in their objectives and in their scope. The art of
   maneuver became decisive, and analysis of war was couched accordingly in
   terms of strategies. The situation changed fundamentally with the outbreak
   of the French Revolution, which increased the size of forces from small
   professional to large conscript armies and broadened the objectives of war
   to the ideals of the revolution, ideals that appealed to the masses who
   were subject to conscription. In the relative order of post-Napoleonic
   Europe, the mainstream of theory returned to the idea of war as a
   rational, limited instrument of national policy. This approach was best
   articulated by the Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz in his
   famous classic On War (1832–37).

   World War I, which was “total” in character because it resulted in the
   mobilization of entire populations and economies for a prolonged period of
   time, did not fit into the Clausewitzian pattern of limited conflict, and
   it led to a renewal of other theories. These no longer regarded war as a
   rational instrument of state policy. The theorists held that war, in its
   modern, total form, if still conceived as a national state instrument,
   should be undertaken only if the most vital interests of the state,
   touching upon its very survival, are concerned. Otherwise, warfare serves
   broad ideologies and not the more narrowly defined interests of a
   sovereign or a nation. Like the religious wars of the 17th century, war
   becomes part of “grand designs,” such as the rising of the proletariat in
   communist eschatology or the Nazi doctrine of a master race.
   Some theoreticians have gone even further, denying war any rational
   character whatsoever. To them war is a calamity and a social disaster,
   whether it is afflicted by one nation upon another or conceived of as
   afflicting humanity as a whole. The idea is not new—in the aftermath of
   the Napoleonic Wars it was articulated, for example, by Tolstoy in the
   concluding chapter of War and Peace (1865–69). In the second half of the
   20th century it gained new currency in peace research, a contemporary form
   of theorizing that combines analysis of the origins of warfare with a
   strong normative element aiming at its prevention. Peace research
   concentrates on two areas: the analysis of the international system and
   the empirical study of the phenomenon of war.

   Upshot-Knothole at the Nevada Test Site, May 25, 1953.(more)
   World War II and the subsequent evolution of weapons of mass destruction
   made the task of understanding the nature of war even more urgent. On the
   one hand, war had become an intractable social phenomenon, the elimination
   of which seemed to be an essential precondition for the survival of
   mankind. On the other hand, the use of war as an instrument of policy was
   calculated in an unprecedented manner by the nuclear superpowers, the
   United States and the Soviet Union. War also remained a stark but rational
   instrumentality in certain more limited conflicts, such as those between
   Israel and the Arab nations. Thinking about war, consequently, became
   increasingly more differentiated because it had to answer questions

   Clausewitz cogently defines war as a rational instrument of foreign
   policy: “an act of violence intended to compel our opponent to fulfill our
   will.” Modern definitions of war, such as “armed conflict between
   political units,” generally disregard the narrow, legalistic definitions
   characteristic of the 19th century, which limited the concept to formally
   declared war between states. Such a definition includes civil wars but at
   the same time excludes such phenomena as insurrections, banditry, or
   piracy. Finally, war is generally understood to embrace only armed
   conflicts on a fairly large scale, usually excluding conflicts in which

   The Russo-Ukrainian War^[c] is an ongoing international conflict between
   Russia and Ukraine, which began in February 2014.^[d] Following Ukraine's
   Revolution of Dignity, Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine and supported
   pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian military in the Donbas war.
   The first eight years of conflict also included naval incidents,
   cyberwarfare, and heightened political tensions. In February 2022, Russia
   launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and began occupying more of the
--
   and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) as independent states, starting
   the Donbas war. The separatists received considerable but covert support
   from Russia, and Ukrainian attempts to fully retake separatist-held areas

   agreements to end the conflict, but they were never fully implemented in
   the years that followed. The Donbas war settled into a violent but static
   conflict between Ukraine and the Russian and separatist forces, with many

   No formal declaration of war has been issued in the ongoing

   After the Minsk agreements, the war settled into static trench warfare

  1967 Arab–Israeli War
   Main article: 1967 Six Day War
   [IMG]During the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel captured the West Bank, the
   Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights and the Sinai Peninsula. Each of these
   territories except the Sinai remain under Israeli occupation.
   The 1967 Six-Day War exerted a significant effect upon Palestinian
   nationalism, as Israel gained military control of the West Bank from
--
   Jordan, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and supported the
   Jordanian army during the War of Attrition, which included the Battle of
   Karameh. However, the Palestinian base in Jordan collapsed with the
   Jordanian–Palestinian civil war in 1970. The PLO defeat by the Jordanians
   caused most of the Palestinian militants to relocate to South Lebanon,
   where they soon took over large areas, creating the so-called "Fatahland".
  1973 Arab–Israeli War

   tremendous casualties.

   Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon peaked in the early 1970s, as

   airplane hijacking campaigns worldwide, which drew Israeli retaliation.
   During the Lebanese Civil War, Palestinian militants continued to launch
   attacks against Israel while also battling opponents within Lebanon. In

   assassination attempt on one of its diplomats by Palestinians, the Israeli
   government decided to take sides in the Lebanese Civil War and the 1982
   Lebanon War commenced. The initial results for Israel were successful.
   Most Palestinian militants were defeated within several weeks, Beirut was

   "Palestine (represented by PLO)" to "State of Palestine". In 2014, another
   war broke out between Israel and Gaza, resulting in over 70 Israeli and
   over 2,000 Palestinian casualties.^[46]

   War film is a film genre concerned with warfare, typically about naval,
   air, or land battles, with combat scenes central to the drama.^[1]^[2]
--
   soldiers, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the effects of
   war on society, and the moral and human issues raised by war. The stories
   told may be fiction, historical drama, or biographical.
   Subgenres, not necessarily distinct, include anti-war, comedy, propaganda,
   and documentary. There are similarly subgenres of the war film in specific
   theatres such as the Western Desert of North Africa and the Pacific in the
   Second World War, Vietnam, or the Soviet–Afghan War; and films set in
   specific domains of war, such as the infantry, the air, at sea, in
   submarines or at prisoner of war camps.
Genre[edit]
   Further information: List of war films
   The war film genre is not necessarily tightly defined: the American Film
   Institute, for example, speaks of "films to grapple with the Great War"
   without attempting to classify these.^[3] However, some directors and
   critics have offered at least tentative definitions. The director Sam
   Fuller defined the genre by saying that "a war film's objective, no matter
   how personal or emotional, is to make a viewer feel war."^[4] John Belton
   identified four narrative elements of the war film within the context of
   Hollywood production: a) the suspension of civilian morality during times
   of war, b) primacy of collective goals over individual motivations, c)
   rivalry between men in predominantly male groups as well as
--
   reintegration of veterans.^[5] The fateful nature of battle scenes means
   that war films often end with them.^[6]

   The film critic Stephen Neale suggests that the genre is for the most part
   well defined and uncontentious, since war films are simply those about war
   being waged in the 20th century, with combat scenes central to the drama.
   However, Neale notes, films set in the American Civil War or the American
   Indian Wars of the 19th century were called war films in the time before
   the First World War.^[1] The critic Julian Smith argues, on the contrary,
   that the war film lacks the formal boundaries of a genre like the Western,
   but that in practice, "successful and influential" war films are about
   modern wars, in particular World War II, with the combination of mobile
   forces and mass killing.^[2] The film scholar Kathryn Kane^[7] points out
   some similarities between the war film genre and the Western. Both genres
   use opposing concepts like war and peace, civilization and savagery. War
   films usually frame World War II as a conflict between "good" and "evil"
   as represented by the Allied forces and Nazi Germany whereas the Western
--
   peoples.^[8] James Clarke notes the similarity between a Western like Sam
   Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch and "war-movie escapades" like The Dirty
   Dozen.^[9]
   The film historian Jeanine Basinger states that she began with a
   preconception of what the war film genre would be, namely that:
     What I knew in advance was what presumably every member of our culture

   Further, Basinger considers Bataan to provide a definition-by-example of
   "the World War II combat film", in which a diverse and apparently unsuited
   group of "hastily assembled volunteers" hold off a much larger group of
   the enemy through their "bravery and tenacity".^[11] She argues that the
   combat film is not a subgenre but the only genuine kind of war film. Since
   she notes that there were in fact only five true combat films made during
   the Second World War, in her view these few films, central to the genre,
   are outweighed by the many other films that are only just war films.^[12]
   However, other critics such as Russell Earl Shain propose a far broader
   definition of war film, to include films that deal "with the roles of
   civilians, espionage agents, and soldiers in any of the aspects of war
   (i.e. preparation, cause, prevention, conduct, daily life, and
--
   with combat scenes for different purposes in other types of film, and
   suggests that war films are characterised by combat which "determines the
   fate of the principal characters". This in turn pushes combat scenes to
   the climactic ends of war films.^[6] Not all critics agree, either, that
   war films must be about 20th-century wars. James Clarke includes Edward
   Zwick's Oscar-winning Glory (1990) among the war films he discusses in
   detail; it is set in the American Civil War, and he lists six other films
   about that war which he considers "notable".^[14]^[a] The screenwriter and
   scholar Eric R. Williams identifies war films as one of eleven

   critical of Christopher Nolan's 2017 film Dunkirk with its unhistorically

   Hitler's final days in his Berlin bunker,^[17] and he considers the 1965

History[edit]
  American Civil War[edit]
   The costliest war in U.S. history in terms of American life, this war has
   been the subject of, or the backdrop to, numerous films, documentaries and
   mini-series. One of the earliest films using the Civil War as its subject
   was D.W. Griffith's 1910 silent picture, The Fugitive.^[18] Films that
   have the war as its main subject, or about a certain aspect of the war,
   include the 1989 film Glory, about the first formal unit of the Union Army
   during the American Civil War to be made up entirely of Black
   volunteers.^[19] Some films such as Gettysburg focused on a single battle
   during the war,^[20] or even on a single incident, like the French short
   film La Rivière du Hibou (An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge)^[21] and
   Disney's The Great Locomotive Chase (1956).^[22] Others like the 1993
   miniseries North and South spanned the entire breadth of the war. Some
   films deal with the human aspects of the war, such as The Red Badge of
   Courage (1951),^[23] or Shenandoah (1965), on the tragedy that the war
   inflicted on the civilian population.^[24] Ken Burns's The Civil War is

   During the First World War, many films were made about life in the war.
   Topics included prisoners of war, covert operations, and military
   training. Both the Central Powers and the Allies produced war
   documentaries. The films were also used as propaganda in neutral countries
   like the United States. Among these was a film shot on the Eastern Front

  Algerian War[edit]
   Gillo Pontecorvo's dramatic The Battle of Algiers ((Italian: La battaglia
   di Algeri; Arabic: معركة الجزائر; French: La Bataille d'Alger), 1966)
   portrayed events in the Algerian War (1954–1956). It was shot on location
   as an Italo-Algerian co-production. It had the black and white newsreel
   style of Italian neorealism, and even-handedly depicts violence on both
   sides. It won various awards including Golden Lion at the Venice Film
   Festival.^[54] It was attacked by French critics and was for five years
   banned in France as well as Jamila, the Algerian (1958).^[55]
  Vietnam War[edit]
   Further information: Vietnam War in film
   Few films before the late 1970s about the Vietnam War actually depicted
   combat;^[56] exceptions include The Green Berets (1968).^[56] Critics such
   as Basinger explain that Hollywood avoided the subject because of
   opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, making the
   subject divisive; in addition, the film industry was in crisis, and the
   army did not wish to assist in making anti-war films.^[56]^[57]
   From the late 1970s, independently financed and produced films showed
   Hollywood that Vietnam could be treated in film. Successful but very
   different portrayals of the war in which America had been defeated
   included Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter (1978), and Francis Ford

   Dino Mustafić's Remake (2003), written by Zlatko Topčić, tells the
   parallel coming-of-age stories of a father living in Sarajevo during World
   War II and his son living through the Siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian
   War. According to Topčić, the story is based on incidents from his own
   life.^[59]^[60]
   The Iraq War served as the background story of U.S. movies, like The Hurt
   Locker from 2008, Green Zone from 2010,^[61] and American Sniper from
   2014.
   The War in Afghanistan since 2001 was depicted in various movies, among

   The first popular Allied war films made during the Second World War came
   from Britain and combined the functions of documentary and propaganda.
--
   British film industry began to combine documentary techniques with
   fictional stories in films like Noël Coward and David Lean's In Which We
   Serve (1942)—"the most successful British film of the war
   years"^[62]—Millions Like Us (1943), and The Way Ahead (1944).^[63]
--
   In America, documentaries were produced in various ways: General Marshall
   commissioned the Why We Fight propaganda series from Frank Capra; the War
   Department's Information-Education Division started out making training
--
   fighters,^[66] and The North Star (1943) showed the Soviet Union and its
   Communist Party.^[67] Towards the end of the war popular books provided
   higher quality and more serious stories for films such as Guadalcanal
--
   Germans surrendering and dead, and atrocities including murdered children
   and hanged civilians. It won an Academy Award in 1943 for best
   documentary.^[71]^[72] Newsreel cameras were similarly rushed to
   Stalingrad early in 1943 to record "the spectacle which greeted the
   Russian soldiers"—the starvation of Russian prisoners of war in the
   Voropovono camp by the German Sixth Army, defeated in the Battle of
   Stalingrad.^[73]
   Feature films made in the west during the war were subject to censorship
   and were not always realistic in nature. One of the first to attempt to

   most costly German film made during the war. The actual siege ended with
   the surrender of the town; in the film, the French generals abandon the
   siege.^[77]
   For Japan, the war began with the undeclared war and invasion of China in
   1937, which the Japanese authorities called "The China Incident". The
--
   even enemy Chinese soldiers are presented as individuals, sometimes
   fighting bravely.^[78] Once war with the United States was declared, the
   Japanese conflict became known as the Pacific War. Japanese film critics
   worried that even with Western film techniques, their film output failed
   to represent native Japanese values.^[79] The historian John Dower found
   that Japanese wartime films had been largely forgotten, as "losers do not
   get reruns", yet they were so subtle and skilful that Frank Capra thought
--
   though Great Britain could figure as the "cultural enemy". For Japanese
   film-makers, war was not a cause but more like a natural disaster, and
   "what mattered was not whom one fought but how well". Asian enemies,
   especially the Chinese, were often portrayed as redeemable and even
   possible marriage partners. Japanese wartime films do not glorify war, but
   present the Japanese state as one great family and the Japanese people as

   that, at every level, the Japanese also victimized others."^[81]

   According to Andrew Pulver of The Guardian, the public fascination with
   war films became an "obsession", with over 200 war films produced in each

   partly because it celebrated an "exclusively British [victory]", it failed

   1955–1958 period in particular. In 1957 alone, Bitter Victory, Count Five
   and Die, The Enemy Below, Ill Met by Moonlight, Men in War, The One That
   Got Away, and Seven Thunders, and the highly successful, critically
   acclaimed pictures The Bridge on the River Kwai (which won the Academy
   Award for Best Picture that year^[89]) and Paths of Glory were
   released.^[90] Some, such as Bitter Victory, focused more on the
   psychological battle between officers and egotism rather than events
   during the war.^[91] The Bridge on the River Kwai brought a new complexity
   to the war picture, with a sense of moral uncertainty surrounding war. By
   the end of the decade the "sense of shared achievement" which had been
   common in war films "began to evaporate", according to Pulver.^[82]
   Hollywood films in the 1950s and 1960s could display spectacular heroics

   lives of the men, the more realistic film.^[92] The formula for a
   successful war film consisted, according to Lawrence Suid, of a small
   group of ethnically diverse men; an unreasonable senior officer; cowards
   became heroic, or died.^[92] Jeanine Basinger suggests that a traditional
   war film should have a hero, a group, and an objective, and that the group
   should contain "an Italian, a Jew, a cynical complainer from Brooklyn, a

   films.^[103] Others tried to portray the reality of the war, as in Joseph

   as far as a movie can go in depicting modern warfare as a stomach-turning
   form of mass slaughter".^[104]

   Quiet on the Western Front, defined the genre as showing: the brutality of
   war; the amount of human suffering; the betrayal of men's trust by
   incompetent officers. War and anti-war films often prove difficult to

   anti-war films criticize war directly through depictions of grisly combat
   in past wars, some films such as Penn's Alice's Restaurant criticized war
   obliquely by poking fun at such things as the draft board.^[162] The
   number of anti-war films produced in America dipped sharply during the

   of resurgence for films of all type including anti-war films in the
   States. Robert Eberwein names two films as anti-war classics.^[164] The
   first is Jean Renoir's prisoner of war masterpiece^[148] La Grande
   Illusion (The Grand Illusion, 1937). Renoir's critique of contemporary
--
   mankind's common experiences should prevail above political division, and
   its extension: war.^[165] The second is Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory
   (1957). The critic David Ehrenstein writes that Paths of Glory established
   Kubrick as the "leading commercial filmmaker of his generation" and a
   world-class talent. Ehrenstein describes the film as an "outwardly
   cool/inwardly passionate protest drama about a disastrous French army
   maneuver and the court-martial held in its wake", contrasting it with the
   "classic" All Quiet on the Western Front's story of an innocent "unstrung
   by the horrors of war".^[166]
  Mixed genres[edit]
   Comedy gave scope for satire, and post-war film-makers merged comedy and
   anti-war sentiment in films as varied as Stalag 17 (1953) and Dr
   Strangelove (1964).^[167] Black comedies like Mike Nichols's Catch-22
   (1970), based on Joseph Heller's satirical novel about the Second World
   War, and Robert Altman's MASH (1970), set in Korea, reflected the
   attitudes of an increasingly sceptical public during the Vietnam
   War.^[168]
   Other genres were combined in Franklin J. Schaffner's Patton (1970), about
   real life General George S. Patton, where combat scenes were interleaved
   with commentary about how he waged war, showing good and bad sides to a
   command. It and MASH became the two most profitable war/anti-war films
   made up to that time,^[169] and Patton won seven Academy Awards.^[170]

            War movies are big earners. What does that say about us?

   Messenger
   War film is serious business. It has been from the beginning, when William
   Wellman’s Wings (1927) became the first World War I romantic drama to win
   an Oscar for best picture. One hundred years later, the supply of war
   films seems inexhaustible and their box-office attraction unbroken.
--
   million.
   The war film genre and its fascination remains.
   There we sit, watching generations get wiped out. We see terrifying
   technological inventions like the atomic bomb being dropped on Hiroshima.
   Removed from actual war in time and place, these big-screen productions
   are horrible yet spellbinding at the same time.
   [ Submit ]
   War Horse (2011) is a particularly effective exploration of this
   experience and what it gives to audiences. Steven Spielberg’s film tells
   the story of a young horse and his owner forced from the idyllic fields of
   rural England into the bloody trenches of first world war France.
   War Horse illustrates the fragile balance of peace, and how sacrifice
   forms lasting bonds across borders, languages and species, echoing the
   Great War’s hard-won reconciliation process as Europeans bonded over grief
   and common trauma. Spielberg pairs moral guidance and a sense of what

   action sequences.
   But this is only one story and only one way to present war as a noble
   sacrifice to forge unity. There is no standard formula to explain why the
   experience of war continuously attracts millions of viewers. The answer is
   different for each war story, and it is different in each nation.
The national war complex
   The first Australian film to win an Academy Award was Damien Parer’s
   documentary of the fighting in New Guinea in 1942. The film garnered a
   Best Documentary Oscar for bringing the immediate experience of humanity
   at war to Australia: the wounded; the anxiety; the young soldiers’ fear of
   death far from home.

   Micronesia. His cinematic legacy is a sobering documentation of
   Australians at war without flagwavers or hyper-masculine action heroes.
   Damien Parer also shot photographs while in New Guinea, including this one
   at a rest spot on the Kokoda Trail. Australian War Memorial
   SBS recently ran a week of war films in the lead-up to ANZAC Day, leading
   with Churchill (2017), which portrays the inner world of Britain’s wartime
   prime minister.
--
   nurse Vera Brittain’s literary memoirs and her calls for pacifism.
   SBS’s War Week included no actual documentary footage like that of
   Parer’s.
   Today, the idea of an authentic representation of war seems less appealing
   to audiences. Marvel Studios broke box-office records all over the world
   with its fantasy battle and sci-fi war film Avengers: Endgame (2019).
   Perhaps too much reality in depicting war, the starkest of all modern
   realities, is simply unbearable. And so the re-enchantment of war comes
   with laser battles and magic gauntlets.
Fact versus fiction
   How we explore war on film has sparked heated debates.
   One argument holds the true horror of war is increasingly obscured by
   technology, Hollywood star power, and clever marketing campaigns.
--
   and The Pacific (2010) caused controversy among military historians who
   accused the series of endorsing war nostalgia, making the audience take
   sides, and actively shaping collective modern memory through re-enacted
   combat scenes.
   War has been co-opted as an entertainment favourite in countries all
   across the world, allowing audiences to think of it as a metaphor to
   explore issues like sexism or mortality.
   One of the most popular South Korean war films, Jang Hoon’s The Front Line
   (2011), suggests the meaning of life cannot be found in senseless wars.
   The Cave (2019), a war documentary by Syrian director Feras Fayyad, shows
   how a group of female doctors in Ghouta struggle with systemic sexism

   Jackson’s film produces a modern war experience by enhancing documentary
   footage of the first world war. We see the real faces of war: they talk,
   they smoke makeshift cigarettes, they are shellshocked victims of their

   the previously silent combatants’ voices.
   The result is a conflicting truth about war and how its memories grow

   Psychological warfare (PSYWAR), or the basic aspects of modern
   psychological operations (PsyOp), have been known by many other names or
   terms, including Military Information Support Operations (MISO), Psy Ops,
   political warfare, "Hearts and Minds", and propaganda.^[1] The term is
   used "to denote any action which is practiced mainly by psychological
--
   Empire.
   Since prehistoric times, warlords and chiefs have recognized the
   importance of weakening the morale of their opponents. In the Battle of
--
   Currying favor with supporters was the other side of psychological
   warfare, and an early practitioner of this was Alexander the Great, who
   successfully conquered large parts of Europe and the Middle East and held
--
   as a result.
   During the Granada War, Spanish captain Hernán Pérez del Pulgar routinely
   employed psychological tactics as part of his guerrilla actions against
--
   disinformation to his opponents, similar to the Operations Fortitude and
   Titanic in World War II.
  World War I[edit]
   [IMG]Lord Bryce led the commission of 1915 to document German atrocities
   committed against Belgian civilians.
   The start of modern psychological operations in war is generally dated to
   World War I. By that point, Western societies were increasingly educated
   and urbanized, and mass media was available in the form of large
--
   explosive delivery systems like modified artillery or mortar rounds.^[13]
   At the start of the war, the belligerents, especially the British and
   Germans, began distributing propaganda, both domestically and on the
--
   communications cable system then in operation. These capabilities were
   easily transitioned to the task of warfare.
   The British also had a diplomatic service that maintained good relations
--
   Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling and H. G. Wells. Over 1,160 pamphlets were
   published during the war and distributed to neutral countries, and
   eventually, to Germany. One of the first significant publications, the
--
   Aerial leaflets were dropped over German trenches containing postcards
   from prisoners of war detailing their humane conditions, surrender notices
   and general propaganda against the Kaiser and the German generals. By the
   end of the war, MI7b had distributed almost 26 million leaflets. The
   Germans began shooting the leaflet-dropping pilots, prompting the British
--
   Belgium.^[16]
   At the start of the war, the French government took control of the media
   to suppress negative coverage. Only in 1916, with the establishment of the
   Maison de la Presse, did they begin to use similar tactics for the purpose
   of psychological warfare. One of its sections was the "Service de la
   Propagande aérienne" (Aerial Propaganda Service), headed by Professor
--
   The Central Powers were slow to use these techniques; however, at the
   start of the war the Germans succeeded in inducing the Sultan of the
   Ottoman Empire to declare 'holy war', or Jihad, against the Western
   infidels. They also attempted to foment rebellion against the British
--
   overthrow of the Tsar. This soon paid off when the Bolshevik Revolution
   took Russia out of the war.^[17]
  World War II[edit]
   Adolf Hitler was greatly influenced by the psychological tactics of
   warfare the British had employed during World War I, and attributed the
   defeat of Germany to the effects this propaganda had on the soldiers. He
--
   Germany's Fall Grün plan of invasion of Czechoslovakia had a large part
   dealing with psychological warfare aimed both at the Czechoslovak
   civilians and government as well as, crucially, at Czechoslovakia's
--
   of UK and France through appeasement to occupy Czechoslovakia without
   having to fight an all-out war, sustaining only minimum losses in covert
   war before the Munich Agreement.
   At the start of the Second World War, the British set up the Political
   Warfare Executive to produce and distribute propaganda. Through the use of
   powerful transmitters, broadcasts could be made across Europe. Sefton
--
   made use of radio broadcasts for propaganda against the Germans. Churchill
   favoured deception; he said "In wartime, truth is so precious that she
   should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.".^[19]
--
   Bodyguard.
   During World War II, the British made extensive use of deception –
   developing many new techniques and theories. The main protagonists at this
--
   deception and double agents helped define Allied deception strategy during
   the war, for which he has been referred to as "the greatest British
   deceiver of WW2".^[22]
   During the lead-up to the Allied invasion of Normandy, many new tactics in
   psychological warfare were devised. The plan for Operation Bodyguard set
   out a general strategy to mislead German high command as to the date and
--
   ground for invasion and "leaked" misinformation about the Allied order of
   battle and war plans.
   Elaborate naval deceptions (Operations Glimmer, Taxable and Big Drum) were
--
   traffic and visual deception. The British "Double Cross" anti-espionage
   operation had proven very successful from the outset of the war,^[25] and
   the LCS was able to use double agents to send back misleading information
   about Allied invasion plans.^[26] The use of visual deception, including
   mock tanks and other military hardware had been developed during the North
   Africa campaign. Mock hardware was created for Bodyguard; in particular,
   dummy landing craft were stockpiled to give the impression that the
--
   The Operation was a strategic success and the Normandy landings caught
   German defences unawares. Continuing deception, portraying the landings as
   a diversion from a forthcoming main invasion in the Calais region, led
--
   battleground for nearly seven weeks.^[27]
  Vietnam War[edit]
   [IMG]"Viet Cong, beware!" – South Vietnam leaflets urging the defection of
   Viet Cong.
   The United States ran an extensive program of psychological warfare during
   the Vietnam War. The Phoenix Program had the dual aim of assassinating
   National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (NLF or Viet Cong) personnel
--
   back for revenge.
   The Vietcong and their forces also used a program of psychological warfare
   during this war. Trịnh Thị Ngọ([ṯɕïŋ˧ˀ˨ʔ tʰi˧ˀ˨ʔ ŋɔ˧ˀ˨ʔ]; 1931 – 30
   September 2016), also known as Thu Hương and Hanoi Hannah, was a
   Vietnamese radio personality. She made English-language broadcasts for
   North Vietnam directed at United States troops. During the Vietnam War,
   Ngọ became famous among US soldiers for her propaganda broadcasts on Radio
--
   made three broadcasts a day, reading a list of newly killed or imprisoned
   Americans, and playing popular US anti-war songs in an effort to incite
   feelings of nostalgia and homesickness, attempting to persuade US GIs that
   the US involvement in the Vietnam War was unjust and immoral.^[29] A
   typical broadcast began as follows:
     How are you, GI Joe? It seems to me that most of you are poorly informed
     about the going of the war, to say nothing about a correct explanation
     of your presence over here. Nothing is more confused than to be ordered
     into a war to die or to be maimed for life without the faintest idea of
     what's going on.^[30]

         (February 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) 
   Most modern uses of the term psychological warfare refer to the following
   military methods:
--
          * Projecting repetitive and disturbing noises and music for long
            periods at high volume towards groups under siege like during
            Operation Nifty Package.
     * Propaganda radio stations, such as Lord Haw-Haw in World War II on the
       "Germany calling" station.

       War.
     * False flag events.
--
     * The threat of chemical weapons.^[41]
     * Information warfare.
   Most of these techniques were developed during World War II or earlier,
   and have been used to some degree in every conflict since. Daniel Lerner

   victory was imminent. Measuring the success or failure of psychological
   warfare is very hard, as the conditions are very far from being a
   controlled experiment.
   Lerner also divides psychological warfare operations into three
   categories:^[42]^[page needed]

   and discredits the source. He writes, "This is one of the few dogmas
   advanced by Sykewarriors that is likely to endure as an axiom of
   propaganda: Credibility is a condition of persuasion. Before you can make
   a man do as you say, you must make him believe what you say."^[42]^: 28 
   Consistent with this idea, the Allied strategy in World War II was
   predominantly one of truth (with certain exceptions).^[citation needed]
   In Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes, Jacques Ellul discusses
   psychological warfare as a common peace policy practice between nations as
   a form of indirect aggression. This type of propaganda drains the public
--
   important element of the People's Republic of China's military
   strategy.^[45]^[46]^[47] This type of warfare is rooted in the Chinese
   Stratagems outlined by Sun Tzu in The Art of War and Thirty-Six
   Stratagems. In its dealings with its rivals, China is expected to utilize

   media to keep a tight hold on propaganda efforts for its people.^[47] The
   Chinese government also utilizes cognitive warfare against Taiwan.^[48]

   The term psychological warfare is believed to have migrated from Germany
   to the United States in 1941.^[65] During World War II, the United States
   Joint Chiefs of Staff defined psychological warfare broadly, stating
   "Psychological warfare employs any weapon to influence the mind of the
   enemy. The weapons are psychological only in the effect they produce and
   not because of the weapons themselves."^[66] The U.S. Department of
   Defense currently defines psychological warfare as:
     "The planned use of propaganda and other psychological actions having

   information-related capabilities."^[70]
