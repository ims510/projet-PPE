   Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of
   war, or of wars in general.^[2] Total war is warfare that is not
   restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in
   massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties.

   aspect of human nature,^[3] others argue it is a result of specific

Types of warfare
   Main article: Types of war
     * Asymmetric warfare is the methods used in conflicts between
       belligerents of drastically different levels of military capability
       or size.^[23]
     * Biological warfare, or germ warfare, is the use of biological
       infectious agents or toxins such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi
--
       pathogens.
     * Chemical warfare involves the use of weaponized chemicals in
       combat. Poison gas as a chemical weapon was principally used during
--
       including more than 100,000 civilians.^[26]
     * Cold warfare is an intense international rivalry without direct
       military conflict, but with a sustained threat of it, including
--
       development, and may involve active conflicts by indirect means,
       such as economic warfare, political warfare, covert operations,
       espionage, cyberwarfare, or proxy wars.
     * Conventional warfare is declared war between states in which
       nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons are not used or see
       limited deployment.
     * Cyberwarfare involves the actions by a nation-state or
       international organization to attack and attempt to damage another
--
       undermining the insurgents' claims against the incumbent regime.
     * Information warfare is the application of destructive force on a
       large scale against information assets and systems, against the
--
       transportation).^[27]
     * Nuclear warfare is warfare in which nuclear weapons are the
       primary, or a major, method of achieving capitulation.
     * Total war is warfare by any means possible, disregarding the laws
       of war, placing no limits on legitimate military targets, using
       weapons and tactics resulting in significant civilian casualties,
       or demanding a war effort requiring significant sacrifices by the
       friendly civilian population.
     * Unconventional warfare, the opposite of conventional warfare, is an
       attempt to achieve military victory through acquiescence,

   Entities contemplating going to war and entities considering whether to
   end a war may formulate war aims as an evaluation/propaganda tool. War
   aims may stand as a proxy for national-military resolve.^[28]
  Definition
   Fried defines war aims as "the desired territorial, economic, military
   or other benefits expected following successful conclusion of a
   war".^[29]
  Classification
   Tangible/intangible aims:
     * Tangible war aims may involve (for example) the acquisition of
       territory (as in the German goal of Lebensraum in the first half of
--
       the Anglo-Dutch Wars).
     * Intangible war aims – like the accumulation of credibility or
       reputation^[30] – may have more tangible expression ("conquest
--
   Explicit/implicit aims:
     * Explicit war aims may involve published policy decisions.
     * Implicit war aims^[32] can take the form of minutes of discussion,
       memoranda and instructions.^[33]
   Positive/negative aims:
     * "Positive war aims" cover tangible outcomes.
     * "Negative war aims" forestall or prevent undesired outcomes.^[34]
   War aims can change in the course of conflict and may eventually morph
   into "peace conditions"^[35] – the minimal conditions under which a
   state may cease to wage a particular war.

   Throughout the course of human history, the average number of people
   dying from war has fluctuated relatively little, being about 1 to 10

   casualties have increased in recent times due to technological
   improvements in warfare, this is not generally true. For instance, the
   Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) had about the same number of casualties

   (WWII). That said, overall the number of casualties from war has not
   significantly increased in recent times. Quite to the contrary, on a

   The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of
   deaths since its start, is World War II, from 1939 to 1945, with
--
   60 million. As concerns a belligerent's losses in proportion to its
   prewar population, the most destructive war in modern history may have
   been the Paraguayan War (see Paraguayan War casualties). In 2013 war
   resulted in 31,000 deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990.^[40] War

   emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of prisoners
   of war or civilians.^[41]^[42]^[43] For instance, of the nine million
   people who were on the territory of the Byelorussian SSR in 1941, some
   1.6 million were killed by the Germans in actions away from
   battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 Jews,
   and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were
   unarmed civilians).^[44] Another byproduct of some wars is the
   prevalence of propaganda by some or all parties in the conflict,^[45]
   and increased revenues by weapons manufacturers.^[46]
   Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been
   waged in the last century. These are the two World Wars, followed by
--
   neighboring peoples. The death toll of World War II, being over
   60 million, surpasses all other war-death-tolls.^[47]

   Military personnel subject to combat in war often suffer mental and

   43 died in the American Civil War, including about 6% in the North and
   approximately 18% in the South.^[61] The war remains the deadliest
   conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000
   military personnel. United States military casualties of war since 1775
   have totaled over two million. Of the 60 million European military

   Typically, war becomes intertwined with the economy and many wars are
   partially or entirely based on economic reasons. Following World War
   II, consensus opinion for many years amongst economists and historians
   was that war can stimulate a country's economy as evidenced by the
   U.S's emergence from the Great Depression,^[74] though modern economic
   analysis has thrown significant doubt on these views. In most cases,
   such as the wars of Louis XIV, the Franco-Prussian War, and World War
   I, warfare primarily results in damage to the economy of the countries
   involved. For example, Russia's involvement in World War I took such a
--
   belligerents cumulatively spent about a trillion U.S. dollars on the
   war effort (as adjusted to 1940 prices).^[76]^[77] The Great Depression
   of the 1930s ended as nations increased their production of war
   materials.^[78]
   By the end of the war, 70% of European industrial infrastructure was
   destroyed.^[79] Property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the
--
   expansion in Europe in 1566
   There are many theories about the motivations for war, but no consensus
   about which are most common.^[81] Military theorist Carl von Clausewitz
   said, "Every age has its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions,
   and its own peculiar preconceptions."^[82]
--
   or ideologies. By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the
   local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare.
   The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of Melanie Klein,
   thought war was the paranoid or projective "elaboration" of
   mourning.^[85] Fornari thought war and violence develop out of our
   "love need": our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which
   we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. For
   the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare.
   Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing
   willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over
--
   Despite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for
   self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war,
   few wars have originated from a desire for war among the general
   populace.^[86] Far more often the general population has been
   reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory that
   looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh.^[87] He argues the
   general populace is more neutral towards war and wars occur when
   leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are
   placed into power. War is caused by leaders who seek war such as
   Napoleon and Hitler. Such leaders most often come to power in times of
   crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the
   nation to war.
     Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor
     in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is

   Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are
   two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging in or after
   the Mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater
   population density and competition over resources; the other sees human
   warfare as a more ancient practice derived from common animal
   tendencies, such as territoriality and sexual competition.^[89]
   The latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found
   in many primate species such as chimpanzees,^[90] as well as in many
   ant species,^[91] group conflict may be a general feature of animal
   social behavior. Some proponents of the idea argue that war, while
   innate, has been intensified greatly by developments of technology and
   social organization such as weaponry and states.^[92]
   Psychologist and linguist Steven Pinker argued that war-related
   behaviors may have been naturally selected in the ancestral environment

   War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive
   international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets
   for natural resources and for wealth. War has also been linked to

   relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars. There

  Marxist
   Main article: Marxist explanations of warfare
   The Marxist theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states all
   modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between
   great (imperialist) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of
   capitalism. Marxist economists Karl Kautsky, Rosa Luxemburg, Rudolf

   This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called
   the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding
   populations and limited resources. Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) wrote
   that populations always increase until they are limited by war,
   disease, or famine.^[103]

  Cultural
   Geoffrey Parker argues that what distinguishes the "Western way of war"
   based in Western Europe chiefly allows historians to explain its
   extraordinary success in conquering most of the world after 1500:
     The Western way of war rests upon five principal foundations:
     technology, discipline, a highly aggressive military tradition, a
     remarkable capacity to innovate and to respond rapidly to the
     innovation of others and – from about 1500 onward – a unique system
     of war finance. The combination of all five provided a formula for
     military success....The outcome of wars has been determined less by
     technology, then by better war plans, the achievement of surprise,
     greater economic strength, and above all superior discipline.^[117]
--
   the best possible outcomes for themselves, and desire to avoid the
   costs of war.^[119] Under one game theory approach, rationalist
   theories posit all actors can bargain, would be better off if war did
   not occur, and likewise seek to understand why war nonetheless
   reoccurs. Under another rationalist game theory without bargaining, the
   peace war game, optimal strategies can still be found that depend upon
   number of iterations played. In "Rationalist Explanations for War",
   James Fearon examined three rationalist explanations for why some
   countries engage in war:
     * Issue indivisibilities
--
     * Commitment problems^[119]
   "Issue indivisibility" occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by
   bargaining, because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be

   countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not
   agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of
   state's victory or loss. For instance, Geoffrey Blainey argues that war
   is a result of miscalculation of strength. He cites historical examples
   of war and demonstrates, "war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic
   crisis which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting

   Within the rationalist tradition, some theorists have suggested that

   validity of applying rationalist theory to some wars.^[126]
  Political science
   The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by Lewis Fry Richardson
   following World War I. More recent databases of wars and armed conflict
   have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project, Peter Brecke and
   the Uppsala Conflict Data Program.^[127]
   The following subsections consider causes of war from system, societal,
   and individual levels of analysis. This kind of division was first
--
    1. Balance of power theory: States have the goal of preventing a
       single state from becoming a hegemon, and war is the result of the
       would-be hegemon's persistent attempts at power acquisition. In
       this view, an international system with more equal distribution of
       power is more stable, and "movements toward unipolarity are
       destabilizing."^[128]^: 147  However, evidence has shown power
       polarity is not actually a major factor in the occurrence of
       wars.^[128]^: 147–48 
    2. Power transition theory: Hegemons impose stabilizing conditions on
       the world order, but they eventually decline, and war occurs when a
       declining hegemon is challenged by another rising power or aims to
       preemptively suppress them.^[128]^: 148  On this view, unlike for
       balance-of-power theory, wars become more probable when power is

   Waterloo, by John Heaviside Clark, 1816
   The morality of war has been the subject of debate for thousands of
   years.^[131]
   The two principal aspects of ethics in war, according to the just war
   theory, are jus ad bellum and jus in bello.^[132]
   Jus ad bellum (right to war), dictates which unfriendly acts and
   circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another
   nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war:
   first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it
   must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit
--
   fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success;
   fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought
   must be proportional to means being used.^[133]^[134]
--
   – The Oxford Companion to World War II.^[135]
   Jus in bello (right in war), is the set of ethical rules when
   conducting war. The two main principles are proportionality and
   discrimination. Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and
--
   suffered.^[136] The principle of discrimination determines who are the
   legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation
   between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants,
   who it is not.^[136] Failure to follow these rules can result in the
   loss of legitimacy for the just-war-belligerent.^[137]
   The just war theory was foundational in the creation of the United
   Nations and in international law's regulations on legitimate war.^[131]

   War is generally defined as violent conflict between states or nations.
   Nations go to war for a variety of reasons. It has been argued that a
   nation will go to war if the benefits of war are deemed to outweigh the
   disadvantages, and if there is a sense that there is not another
   mutually agreeable solution. More specifically, some have argued that
   wars are fought primarily for economic, religious, and political
   reasons. Others have claimed that most wars today are fought for
   ideological reasons.
   In the United States, the legal power to declare war is vested in
   Congress; however, the president is the commander-in-chief of the
   military, so he or she holds power to conduct a war once it has been
   declared. In many instances, the president has used military force
   without declaring war.
   Just War Theory
   In Western tradition, there is a sense that the reasons for war must be
   just. This idea dates back to ancient times, but is most clearly traced
   to the writings of St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas. They attempted
   to justify war, and reconcile it with the Christian belief that taking
   a human life is wrong.
   To Aquinas, a war must be just in both the reasons for going to war and
   how war is fought. Reasons for going to war—jus ad bellum—are just if
   (1) war is declared by an appropriate authority; (2) the war is waged
   for a just cause; and (3) the war is waged for just intentions. An
   appropriate authority is a proper, governing authority. A “just cause”
--
   success; (5) the good that will be achieved must outweigh the bad; and
   (6) war must be a last resort.
   Once just reasons for going to war are satisfied, conduct in the
   war—jus in bello—must be just as well. Just conduct in a war means that
   it must be specific and proportional. That is, noncombatants and
--
   Law of War
   Some of the just war theories have been adopted as parts of
   international agreements and incorporated into the law of war (i.e.,
   international law) that regulates the resort to armed force, the
   conduct of hostilities, and the protection of war victims.
   The Geneva Conventions, for example, are a series of international
   treaties that are designed to protect noncombatants, civilians, and
   prisoners of war. The treaties were negotiated in Geneva, Switzerland,
   between 1864 and 1977. The First and Second Geneva Conventions apply to
--
   to protecting the wounded and sick, as well as medical personnel and
   transports. The Third Geneva Convention applies to prisoners of war,
   and the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to people in occupied

   Reflecting changes in the international system, theories of war have
   passed through several phases in the course of the past three
   centuries. After the ending of the wars of religion, about the middle
   of the 17th century, wars were fought for the interests of individual
   sovereigns and were limited both in their objectives and in their
   scope. The art of maneuver became decisive, and analysis of war was
   couched accordingly in terms of strategies. The situation changed
--
   increased the size of forces from small professional to large conscript
   armies and broadened the objectives of war to the ideals of the
   revolution, ideals that appealed to the masses who were subject to
   conscription. In the relative order of post-Napoleonic Europe, the
   mainstream of theory returned to the idea of war as a rational, limited
   instrument of national policy. This approach was best articulated by
--
   conflict, and it led to a renewal of other theories. These no longer
   regarded war as a rational instrument of state policy. The theorists
   held that war, in its modern, total form, if still conceived as a
   national state instrument, should be undertaken only if the most vital
   interests of the state, touching upon its very survival, are concerned.
   Otherwise, warfare serves broad ideologies and not the more narrowly
   defined interests of a sovereign or a nation. Like the religious wars
   of the 17th century, war becomes part of “grand designs,” such as the
   rising of the proletariat in communist eschatology or the Nazi doctrine
   of a master race.
   Some theoreticians have gone even further, denying war any rational
   character whatsoever. To them war is a calamity and a social disaster,
   whether it is afflicted by one nation upon another or conceived of as
--
   contemporary form of theorizing that combines analysis of the origins
   of warfare with a strong normative element aiming at its prevention.
   Peace research concentrates on two areas: the analysis of the
   international system and the empirical study of the phenomenon of war.

   World War II and the subsequent evolution of weapons of mass
   destruction made the task of understanding the nature of war even more
   urgent. On the one hand, war had become an intractable social
   phenomenon, the elimination of which seemed to be an essential
   precondition for the survival of mankind. On the other hand, the use of
   war as an instrument of policy was calculated in an unprecedented
   manner by the nuclear superpowers, the United States and the Soviet

   Clausewitz cogently defines war as a rational instrument of foreign
   policy: “an act of violence intended to compel our opponent to fulfill
   our will.” Modern definitions of war, such as “armed conflict between
   political units,” generally disregard the narrow, legalistic
   definitions characteristic of the 19th century, which limited the
   concept to formally declared war between states. Such a definition
   includes civil wars but at the same time excludes such phenomena as
   insurrections, banditry, or piracy. Finally, war is generally
   understood to embrace only armed conflicts on a fairly large scale,

   Italian nationalism was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was
   initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions. One of
   the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of the
   war was Gabriele D'Annunzio, who promoted Italian irredentism and
   helped sway the Italian public to support intervention in the
   war.^[313] The Italian Liberal Party, under the leadership of Paolo
   Boselli, promoted intervention in the war on the side of the Allies and
   used the Dante Alighieri Society to promote Italian nationalism.^[314]
   Italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose
   it; some were militant supporters of the war, including Benito
   Mussolini and Leonida Bissolati.^[315] However, the Italian Socialist
   Party decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors were
   killed, resulting in a general strike called Red Week.^[316] The
   Italian Socialist Party purged itself of pro-war nationalist members,
   including Mussolini.^[316] Mussolini, a syndicalist who supported the
   war on grounds of irredentist claims on Italian-populated regions of
   Austria-Hungary, formed the pro-interventionist Il Popolo d'Italia and

   possibility of an outbreak of civil war in Ireland. Irish nationalists

   War film is a film genre concerned with warfare, typically about naval,
   air, or land battles, with combat scenes central to the drama.^[1]^[2]
--
   between soldiers, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the
   effects of war on society, and the moral and human issues raised by
   war. The stories told may be fiction, historical drama, or
   biographical.
   Subgenres, not necessarily distinct, include anti-war, comedy,
   propaganda, and documentary. There are similarly subgenres of the war
   film in specific theatres such as the Western Desert of North Africa
   and the Pacific in the Second World War, Vietnam, or the Soviet–Afghan
   War; and films set in specific domains of war, such as the infantry,
   the air, at sea, in submarines or at prisoner of war camps.
Genre[edit]
   Further information: List of war films
   The war film genre is not necessarily tightly defined: the American
   Film Institute, for example, speaks of "films to grapple with the Great
--
   and critics have offered at least tentative definitions. The director
   Sam Fuller defined the genre by saying that "a war film's objective, no
   matter how personal or emotional, is to make a viewer feel war."^[4]
   John Belton identified four narrative elements of the war film within
   the context of Hollywood production: a) the suspension of civilian
   morality during times of war, b) primacy of collective goals over
   individual motivations, c) rivalry between men in predominantly male
--
   depiction of the reintegration of veterans.^[5] The fateful nature of
   battle scenes means that war films often end with them.^[6]
   [300px-John_Wayne_in_The_Longest_Day_trailer.jpg] John Wayne in The

   The film critic Stephen Neale suggests that the genre is for the most
   part well defined and uncontentious, since war films are simply those
   about war being waged in the 20th century, with combat scenes central
   to the drama. However, Neale notes, films set in the American Civil War
   or the American Indian Wars of the 19th century were called war films
   in the time before the First World War.^[1] The critic Julian Smith
   argues, on the contrary, that the war film lacks the formal boundaries
   of a genre like the Western, but that in practice, "successful and
   influential" war films are about modern wars, in particular World War
   II, with the combination of mobile forces and mass killing.^[2] The
   film scholar Kathryn Kane^[7] points out some similarities between the
   war film genre and the Western. Both genres use opposing concepts like
   war and peace, civilization and savagery. War films usually frame World
   War II as a conflict between "good" and "evil" as represented by the
--
   peoples.^[8] James Clarke notes the similarity between a Western like
   Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch and "war-movie escapades" like The Dirty
   Dozen.^[9]
   The film historian Jeanine Basinger states that she began with a
   preconception of what the war film genre would be, namely that:
     What I knew in advance was what presumably every member of our
--
   argues that the combat film is not a subgenre but the only genuine kind
   of war film. Since she notes that there were in fact only five true
   combat films made during the Second World War, in her view these few
   films, central to the genre, are outweighed by the many other films
   that are only just war films.^[12] However, other critics such as
   Russell Earl Shain propose a far broader definition of war film, to
   include films that deal "with the roles of civilians, espionage agents,
   and soldiers in any of the aspects of war (i.e. preparation, cause,
   prevention, conduct, daily life, and consequences or aftermath.)"^[13]
   Neale points out that genres overlap, with combat scenes for different
   purposes in other types of film, and suggests that war films are
   characterised by combat which "determines the fate of the principal
   characters". This in turn pushes combat scenes to the climactic ends of
   war films.^[6] Not all critics agree, either, that war films must be
   about 20th-century wars. James Clarke includes Edward Zwick's
   Oscar-winning Glory (1990) among the war films he discusses in detail;
   it is set in the American Civil War, and he lists six other films about
   that war which he considers "notable".^[14]^[a] The screenwriter and
   scholar Eric R. Williams identifies war films as one of eleven
   super-genres in his screenwriters' taxonomy, claiming that all
--
   For example, he calls the 2000 American film U-571 a "shameless
   deception" for pretending that a US warship had helped to win the
   Battle of the Atlantic—seven months before America entered the
   war.^[17] He is equally critical of Christopher Nolan's 2017 film
   Dunkirk with its unhistorically empty beaches, low-level air combat
--
   days in his Berlin bunker,^[17] and he considers the 1965 French film
   The 317th Platoon, set in Vietnam, "the greatest war movie ever made".
   The 1966 film The Battle of Algiers is, he argues, a close second.^[17]
--
American Civil War[edit]
   The costliest war in U.S. history in terms of American life, this war
   has been the subject of, or the backdrop to, numerous films,
--
   Civil War as its subject was D.W. Griffith's 1910 silent picture, The
   Fugitive.^[18] Films that have the war as its main subject, or about a
   certain aspect of the war, include the 1989 film Glory, about the first
   formal unit of the Union Army during the American Civil War to be made
   up entirely of Black volunteers.^[19] Some films such as Gettysburg
   focused on a single battle during the war,^[20] or even on a single
   incident, like the French short film La Rivière du Hibou (An Occurrence
--
   (1956).^[22] Others like the 1993 miniseries North and South spanned
   the entire breadth of the war. Some films deal with the human aspects
   of the war, such as The Red Badge of Courage (1951),^[23] or Shenandoah
   (1965), on the tragedy that the war inflicted on the civilian
   population.^[24] Ken Burns's The Civil War is the most-watched

   War I
   During the First World War, many films were made about life in the war.
   Topics included prisoners of war, covert operations, and military
   training. Both the Central Powers and the Allies produced war
   documentaries. The films were also used as propaganda in neutral
   countries like the United States. Among these was a film shot on the
   Eastern Front by official war photographer to the Central Powers,

   conduct of the war, as did later films like The Bridges at Toko-Ri

   were anti-war. No Hollywood films about the Korean War did well at the
   box office; the historian Lary May suggested in 2001 that they reminded
   American viewers of "the only war we have lost".^[51]

   Information. The British film industry began to combine documentary

   the war years"^[62]—Millions Like Us (1943), and The Way Ahead

   for best documentary.^[71]^[72] Newsreel cameras were similarly rushed
   to Stalingrad early in 1943 to record "the spectacle which greeted the
   Russian soldiers"—the starvation of Russian prisoners of war in the
   Voropovono camp by the German Sixth Army, defeated in the Battle of
   Stalingrad.^[73]

   in 1937, which the Japanese authorities called "The China Incident".

   values.^[79] The historian John Dower found that Japanese wartime films
   had been largely forgotten, as "losers do not get reruns", yet they
--
   Britain could figure as the "cultural enemy". For Japanese film-makers,
   war was not a cause but more like a natural disaster, and "what
   mattered was not whom one fought but how well". Asian enemies,
   especially the Chinese, were often portrayed as redeemable and even
   possible marriage partners. Japanese wartime films do not glorify war,
   but present the Japanese state as one great family and the Japanese
--
   others."^[81]
  Postwar[edit]
   Further information: List of World War II films
--
   According to Andrew Pulver of The Guardian, the public fascination with
   war films became an "obsession", with over 200 war films produced in
   each decade of the 1950s and 1960s.^[82] War film production in the
--
   "exclusively British [victory]", it failed in the American market.^[88]
   A large number of war films were made in the 1955–1958 period in
   particular. In 1957 alone, Bitter Victory, Count Five and Die, The
--
   and Seven Thunders, and the highly successful, critically acclaimed
   pictures The Bridge on the River Kwai (which won the Academy Award for
   Best Picture that year^[89]) and Paths of Glory were released.^[90]
   Some, such as Bitter Victory, focused more on the psychological battle
   between officers and egotism rather than events during the war.^[91]
   The Bridge on the River Kwai brought a new complexity to the war
   picture, with a sense of moral uncertainty surrounding war. By the end
   of the decade the "sense of shared achievement" which had been common
   in war films "began to evaporate", according to Pulver.^[82]
   Hollywood films in the 1950s and 1960s could display spectacular
--
   attention to the lives of the men, the more realistic film.^[92] The
   formula for a successful war film consisted, according to Lawrence
   Suid, of a small group of ethnically diverse men; an unreasonable
   senior officer; cowards became heroic, or died.^[92] Jeanine Basinger
   suggests that a traditional war film should have a hero, a group, and
   an objective, and that the group should contain "an Italian, a Jew, a
--
   The Guns of Navarone (1961), The Train (1964), and Where Eagles Dare
   (1968). These used the war as a backdrop for spectacular action.^[82]

   traditional war films, while the controversy around the help given by
   the U.S. Army and Zanuck's "disregard for Pentagon relations" changed

   time"; and that combat films have always been "grounded in the need to
   help an audience understand and accept war".^[74] Its success revived
   interest in World War II films.^[103] Others tried to portray the
   reality of the war, as in Joseph Vilsmaier's Stalingrad (1993), which
   The New York Times said "goes about as far as a movie can go in
   depicting modern warfare as a stomach-turning form of mass
   slaughter".^[104]

   Plain (1959).^[120] From the late 1990s, films started to take a

   films, including Pride (1998), Merdeka 17805 (2001), and The Truth
   about Nanjing (2007), have emphasized positive traits of the Japanese
   military and contended that the Japanese were victims of post-war
   vindictiveness and viciousness. Such films have, however, been subject
   to protest for revisionism.^[120]^[121]^[122] The Eternal Zero (2013)

   A popular subgenre of war films in the 1950s and 1960s was the prisoner
   of war film.^[144] The genre was popularised in Britain with major
   films like Guy Hamilton's The Colditz Story (1955) and John Sturges's
   American film The Great Escape (1963).^[144] They told stories of real
   escapes from German prisoner of war camps such as Stalag Luft III in
   the Second World War. Despite episodes of danger and human tragedy,
   these films delight in a continual boyish game of escape and ingenuity,
   celebrating the courage and the defiant spirit of the prisoners of war,
   and treating war as fun.^[144]^[145]^[146] David Lean's Bridge on the

  Anti-war[edit]

   [140px-All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front_%281930_film%29_poster.jpg]
   Anti-war: Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front, 1930
   The anti-war genre began with films about the First World War. Films in
   the genre are typically revisionist, reflecting on past events and
   often generically blended. Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western
   Front (1930) was unquestionably powerful, and an early anti-war film,
   portraying a German point of view; it was the first film (in any genre)
--
   analysing All Quiet on the Western Front, defined the genre as showing:
   the brutality of war; the amount of human suffering; the betrayal of
   men's trust by incompetent officers. War and anti-war films often prove
   difficult to categorize as they contain many generic ambiguities.^[1]
   While many anti-war films criticize war directly through depictions of
   grisly combat in past wars, some films such as Penn's Alice's
   Restaurant criticized war obliquely by poking fun at such things as the
   draft board.^[162] The number of anti-war films produced in America
   dipped sharply during the 1950s because of McCarthyism and the
--
   introduction of the MPAA rating system marked a time of resurgence for
   films of all type including anti-war films in the States. Robert
   Eberwein names two films as anti-war classics.^[164] The first is Jean
   Renoir's prisoner of war masterpiece^[148] La Grande Illusion (The
   Grand Illusion, 1937). Renoir's critique of contemporary politics and
--
   common experiences should prevail above political division, and its
   extension: war.^[165] The second is Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory
   (1957). The critic David Ehrenstein writes that Paths of Glory
--
   generation" and a world-class talent. Ehrenstein describes the film as
   an "outwardly cool/inwardly passionate protest drama about a disastrous
   French army maneuver and the court-martial held in its wake",
   contrasting it with the "classic" All Quiet on the Western Front's
   story of an innocent "unstrung by the horrors of war".^[166]
  Mixed genres[edit]
   Comedy gave scope for satire, and post-war film-makers merged comedy
   and anti-war sentiment in films as varied as Stalag 17 (1953) and Dr
   Strangelove (1964).^[167] Black comedies like Mike Nichols's Catch-22
--
   about real life General George S. Patton, where combat scenes were
   interleaved with commentary about how he waged war, showing good and
   bad sides to a command. It and MASH became the two most profitable
   war/anti-war films made up to that time,^[169] and Patton won seven
   Academy Awards.^[170]

   But this is only one story and only one way to present war as a noble
   sacrifice to forge unity. There is no standard formula to explain why
   the experience of war continuously attracts millions of viewers. The
   answer is different for each war story, and it is different in each
   nation.
The national war complex
   The first Australian film to win an Academy Award was Damien Parer’s
   documentary of the fighting in New Guinea in 1942. The film garnered a
   Best Documentary Oscar for bringing the immediate experience of
   humanity at war to Australia: the wounded; the anxiety; the young
   soldiers’ fear of death far from home.
--
   Micronesia. His cinematic legacy is a sobering documentation of
   Australians at war without flagwavers or hyper-masculine action heroes.
   Damien Parer also shot photographs while in New Guinea, including this
   one at a rest spot on the Kokoda Trail. Australian War Memorial
   SBS recently ran a week of war films in the lead-up to ANZAC Day,
   leading with Churchill (2017), which portrays the inner world of
   Britain’s wartime prime minister.

   Parer’s.
   Today, the idea of an authentic representation of war seems less
   appealing to audiences. Marvel Studios broke box-office records all
   over the world with its fantasy battle and sci-fi war film Avengers:
   Endgame (2019). Perhaps too much reality in depicting war, the starkest
   of all modern realities, is simply unbearable. And so the
   re-enchantment of war comes with laser battles and magic gauntlets.

   and Egypt, which arose around 3,000 BC. From that point until the
   present day, history is little more than a catalog of endless wars.
   Between 1740 and 1897, there were 230 wars and revolutions in Europe,
   and during this time countries were almost bankrupting themselves with
--
   and early twentieth centuries, but this was only because of the awesome
   technological power nations could now utilize, which meant that wars
   were over more quickly. In reality, the death toll from wars rose
   sharply. Whereas only 30 million people died in all the wars between
   1740 and 1897, estimates of the number of dead in the First World War
   range from 5 million to 13 million, and a staggering 50 million people
   died during the Second World War. (Since then, deaths from warfare have
   declined significantly, for reasons I will discuss later.)

   There are also biological attempts to explain war. Men are biologically
   primed to fight wars because of the large amount of testosterone they
   contain, since it is widely believed that testosterone is linked to
--
   However, these explanations are highly problematic. For example, they
   cannot explain the apparent lack of warfare in early human history, or
   pre-history, and the relative lack of conflict in most traditional
   hunter-gatherer societies. This is a hotly debated issue, and there are
   some scholars and scientists who claim that warfare has always existed
   in human societies.

   anthropologist R. Brian Ferguson has amassed convincing evidence to
   show that warfare is only around 10,000 years old, and only became
   frequent from around 6,000 years ago.

   might be able to explain specific outbreaks of violence, warfare is
   actually much more than this. Warfare is a highly planned and organized

   Psychological Explanations
   The first psychologist to investigate war was William James, who wrote
   the seminal essay "The Moral Equivalent of War" in 1910. Here James
   suggested that warfare was so prevalent because of its positive
   psychological effects, both on the individual and on society as a
--
   The Fragmented Self
   On a social level, war delivers a sense of unity in the face of a
   collective threat. It binds people together—not just the army engaged
   in battle, but the whole community. It brings what James referred to as
   discipline—a sense of cohesion, with communal goals. The "war effort"
   inspires individual citizens (not just soldiers) to behave honorably
   and unselfishly in service of a greater good.
   On an individual level, one of the positive effects of war is that it
   makes people feel more alive, alert, and awake. In James’ words, it
--
   One obvious factor is the drive to increase wealth, status, and power.
   A major motivation of warfare is the desire of one group of human
   beings—usually governments, but often the general population of a
--
   by seizing their territory and resources.
   Pick almost any war in history and you’ll find some variant of these
   causes: wars to annex new territory, to colonize new lands, to take
   control of valuable minerals or oil, to help build an empire to
--
   blow of losing its favored government in the Ukraine.
   Secondly, war is strongly related to group identity. Human beings, in
   general, have a strong need for belonging and identity which can easily
--
   The problem with this isn’t so much having pride in our identity, but
   the attitude it engenders towards other groups. Identifying exclusively
   with a particular group automatically creates a sense of rivalry and
--
   Pinker points out in The Better Angels of Our Nature — there has been a
   steady worldwide decline in the number of deaths due to warfare. In
   Europe, countries that had been in an almost constant state of war with
   one or more of their neighbors for centuries — such as France, Germany,
--
   the 1980s — saw an increase in intrastate violence in the world as a
   whole, due to a large number of civil wars. But since the 1980s,
   intrastate violence has declined too, so that the last 25-30 years have
   been by far the least war-afflicted in recent history, and we've seen a
   correspondingly low number of casualties.

   peacefulness — for example, the nuclear deterrent, the growth of
   democracy (making it more difficult for governments to declare war
   against the will of their citizens), the work of international

   is a good example of what William James meant by a moral equivalent of
   war — an activity that satisfies similar psychological needs to war,
   and has a similar invigorating and socially-binding effect, but does

   increased interconnection leads to a decline in group identity, and in
   enmity towards other groups. It promotes moral inclusion, an expansion
   of empathy, and makes it less possible for us to perceive different

   Perhaps, then, as a species, we are slowly beginning to transcend the
   pathology of warfare. Hopefully conflicts such as the present one in
   Ukraine will be seen more and more as aberrations, as group identity

   pressure — which unfortunately I don’t have space to discuss here. See

   Psychological warfare (PSYWAR), or the basic aspects of modern
   psychological operations (PsyOp), have been known by many other names
   or terms, including Military Information Support Operations (MISO), Psy
   Ops, political warfare, "Hearts and Minds", and propaganda.^[1] The
   term is used "to denote any action which is practiced mainly by

   Since prehistoric times, warlords and chiefs have recognized the
   importance of weakening the morale of their opponents. In the Battle of

   Currying favor with supporters was the other side of psychological

   The start of modern psychological operations in war is generally dated
   to World War I. By that point, Western societies were increasingly

   rounds.^[13]
   At the start of the war, the belligerents, especially the British and
   Germans, began distributing propaganda, both domestically and on the
--

     __________________________________________________________________
   What psychology is common to most, if not all wars? What mindsets lead
   to war?
   Human history is mostly of conflict and war. History teaches many
   lessons, but has few students. It seems that the main fact that humans
   can learn from history is that humans don’t learn from history.
   The cycle seems to be: conflict leading to war, massive damage,
   casualties and costs on all sides, collective statements of ‘never
--
   War seems so much part of the human condition that it is reasonable to
   ask: are humans hard-wired for war? Do genetics drive people to war so
   that their genes can be better reproduced after destroying the genes of
--
   Many anthropologists and archaeologists have provided evidence that
   human warfare emerged around only 6000 to 10000 years ago. The
   emergence of war coincides with the creation of agrarian systems and
   societies. Organising the mass production of food freed many people
--
   class then emerged.
   If wars only began after some people had the free time and the status
   to direct it, that indicates: the desire for war is not hard-wired, or,
   if hard-wired, the desire for war requires that time and resources are
   available for any such genes to be expressed.
   In the last 3000 years there have been few periods without war in
   Europe where richer nations appeared to have the genes, the time and
   resources. However, since the foundation of the forerunner of the EU in
   the aftermath of WWII, (created to prevent war), there have been no
   wars between any members of the EU, despite having the same gene pool,
   and vast time and resources being available. What explains the outbreak
--
   together, and have peaceful ways of resolving the inevitable conflicts,
   don’t make war on each other. Possibly where there is shared law, and
   equal access to justice, creating the mechanisms of trust, people
   generally live in peace, despite any minor disagreements. If war were
   hard-wired, and made possible by time and resource availability, such
   trading and cooperation structures as the EU would not prevent war.
   Most civil wars in recent history took place despite all of the above
   apparently being in place. Perhaps, when those systems break down war
   is still possible, or, is even inevitable. For example, when one or
   both parties to a potential civil war are not prepared to accept a
   shared solution, or, there is no mechanism to find, or implement, a new
   mutually acceptable status quo, perhaps war, or the separation of the
   parties in to new countries, is the only way to resolve the conflict.
--
   psychopathy. Perhaps it is the dysfunctional psychology of many
   political “leaders,” that leads to war; in their attempts to cling to
   power they relinquish any principle, tell any lie, and order any act.
   Anyone who has followed a war either in real time, or in history, will
   have noted the lies that are told, and atrocities committed by both
   sides. ‘Truth is the first casualty of war,’ although often stated as
   truism, is, itself, not true. By the time someone is in a position to
   call for, or order war, truth and integrity have long since been
   accepted as ongoing collateral damage in their quest for power. War
   reveals that mendacity more starkly.
   Some wars are fought over control of or access to resources. Most
   species of animal only kill to eat. Those that kill but do not eat,
   usually do so, only if they are under actual physical threat. Humans
   will kill each other if their ideas are under threat. Many wars are
   fought over political ideology, religion, values, beliefs, governmental
--
   conflate personal survival with the acceptance of their ideas? Do
   people need validation so much that they are willing to go to war for
   it? While that may sound irrational, it seems to be so when people
   declare such as: ‘I am willing to kill or die for my beliefs.’ Here is
   an example from the cold war era: ‘I’d rather be dead than Red.’
   Politicians throughout history have directed people to commit murder on
--
   Since few people are prepared to harm anyone, let alone those who are
   just like them, it is necessary for politicians who wish war to
   ‘otherise’; to create an enemy, to spin that enemy as an existential
   threat to their people, to their way of life, to their ideas.
   The horrors of war are only possible if decent people can be convinced
   to murder; if they become the ‘Universal Soldier’, (as so well
--
   human rights; they are the subjects of moral exclusion.
   The brainwashing process of preparing a people for war is the same one
   that is used by cult leaders to disparage non-cult members, and keep
   cult members under control.
   Many other psychological factors are involved in war. Here are just
   some:
--
Fear
   Humans have, over and over again, gone to war, for fear of being
   attacked. That is, fear of war creates war. Countless lives have been
   lost in ‘pre-emptive’ attacks to ‘defend’ against a threat that was
--
Hypocrisy
   Each party involved feels their war is ‘just’, in various forms:
   defending their country, their way of life, their resources, their
   morality. Each can justify fighting a war with their righteous
   indignation, but their enemies are condemned for thinking and acting in
--
   murder of their ‘enemies’, the egos of leaders in the present are
   tempted to write their place in history via war. What kind of person is
   prepared to authorise the massacre of millions to make themself
   ‘immortal’? A psychopath. The history and psychology of war seems to be
   the history and psychology of psychopaths.
--
“God is on our side”
   War after war has been fought in the name of religion, or justified
   using religion. Both sides use the same justifications and/or claim
--
   (for example, not to kill). Religion is co-opted and corrupted by
   politicians, and used to ‘justify’ war.
The first act of any organisation
--
   gripped by group think, it can quickly start and continue the madness
   of war.
There are no winners
--
   dysfunctional psychology. It matters not which side has the most
   delusional thinking, there are no winners in war, only greater or
   lesser losers.
   The people who fight wars are the youngest, fittest, and strongest,
   huge numbers of whom are killed in battle. The gene pool is diminished
--
   had no children.
   Vast numbers of the soldiers involved in a war have their lives ruined
   by post traumatic stress injury. They suffer nightmares for life, their
--
   suicide are all higher in those unlucky enough to have seen the reality
   of war.
   Few peoples have avoided paying massive costs for going to war. Are the
   costs of directing a country to go to war borne by those who direct it?
   No. Political systems seem to immunise those who start wars from the
   consequences of their decisions. Perhaps that immunity makes them more

   complicated by the intense density of Gaza’s population within which
