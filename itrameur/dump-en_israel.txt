   The four-day ceasefire and hostage agreement tentatively reached between
   Israel and Hamas is a breakthrough following weeks of negotiations
   brokered by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States. Despite this, analysts
   highly doubt this brief truce will lead to a long-lasting ceasefire or any
   significant cessation of hostilities in a war nearing its fiftieth day.

   Reached on Wednesday, the agreement aims to facilitate Hamas’ release of
   50 hostages, civilian women and children, currently held in the Gaza
   Strip, and Israel releasing approximately three times as many Palestinian
   women and children in its prisons.

   Israel has further clarified that it will extend the ceasefire for each
   day Hamas agrees to release an additional 10 hostages it is holding. Hamas
   kidnapped as many as 240 Israeli and foreign civilians from Southern
   Israel during its unprecedented Oct. 7 attack that sparked this present
   war, the deadliest Gaza has ever seen.

   The ceasefire took effect on Friday, with Hamas releasing 24 people and
   Israel freeing 39 Palestinian prisoners.

   President Biden has said “the chances are real” that this pause could lead
   to a longer ceasefire, noting that it’s “only a start, but so far it’s
   gone well.”

   Ryan Bohl, a senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at the risk
   intelligence company RANE, dubbed the truce the “first significant
   diplomatic breakthrough” in this war so far, noting that it means
   humanitarian conditions in Gaza will be “allowed to improved” for at least
   a few days.

   The ceasefire comes amidst a war that has displaced two-thirds of Gaza’s
   2.2 million population, who have limited access to food and water. An
   estimated 200,000 Israelis living in border communities with Gaza and
   Lebanon in the north have also faced displacement since Oct. 7.

   “In terms of what’s next, what we needed to see is a diplomatic process
   that in some form or another will address Israel’s security concerns,
   which are driven by Hamas’s control of the Gaza Strip,” Bohl told me.

   “If this diplomatic process can somehow end Hamas’s control of Gaza, then
   it would preclude the need for further Israeli military operations and
   potentially prevent a full-scale reoccupation of Gaza by the Israeli
   military,” he said.

   However, Bohl underlined that this is “a very difficult scenario” since it
   would require Hamas to “accept a secondary or perhaps even non-existent
   formal role in Gaza” and perhaps even necessitate Israel accepting that it
   might not get all the perpetrators of the Oct. 7 attack.

   Independent Middle East analyst Kyle Orton believes there is “little
   chance” this ceasefire will lead to “a broader cessation of hostilities.”

   “Israel is willing to try anything to get the hostages back, but the
   determination to destroy Hamas remains: after Oct. 7, there is an
   overwhelming consensus within Israel that there can be no security while
   Hamas rules Gaza,” Orton told me.

   Israel’s campaign began shortly after the Hamas attack 49 days ago. So
   far, it has lasted almost as long as the longest Israeli operation against
   Hamas to date, Operation Protective Edge in mid-2014, which lasted 51 days
   but has proven far more deadly for Gaza and its inhabitants.

   While an estimated 2,310 Palestinians lost their lives in that 2014
   operation, an estimated 14,100 have been killed in the present conflict,
   according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It’s presently unclear how many of
   these are Hamas or other militants. The Hamas attack on Israel that
   precipitated this war was also the deadliest in Israel's modern history,
   killing at least 1,200 Israelis, the overwhelming majority of whom were
   civilians.

   “It is possible that we see humanitarian pauses and or a more restrained
   Israeli military campaign going forward to ease humanitarian concerns from
   the United States,” Bohl said. “But broadly, we are likely to see a
   resumption of Israeli military operations in the coming days or weeks in
   order to finish up the ground invasion.”

   “This is in large part because there are no readily viable options that
   address Israel’s security concerns short of this,” he added.

   Both Israel and Hamas made concessions to reach this agreement. Israel had
   previously maintained it wanted all the hostages released, while Hamas was
   insisting it would only trade the hostages for the estimated 6,000
   Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons.

   The two sides have also declared their readiness to resume fighting.

   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the trade a “difficult”
   but “right decision,” vowing that no hostage deal would end the fighting.
   He affirmed Israel will fight on until it meets its stated objectives of
   “eradicating Hamas, bringing all hostages back, and ensuring that in the
   day after Hamas, Gaza won’t threaten Israel.”

   For its part, Hamas declared that “our fingers remain on the trigger” and
   its “victorious fighters will remain on the lookout to defend our people
   and defeat the occupation.”

   Nicholas Heras, senior director of strategy and innovation at the New
   Lines Institute, described the ceasefire deal as “an inflection point” in
   the conflict.

   “The Netanyahu-led government insists that it will not have the IDF
   (Israel Defense Forces) leave Gaza until Hamas is removed from power, but
   there is enormous pressure from Biden on Netanyahu behind the scenes to
   end the conflict as soon as possible,” Heras told me.

   “For these reasons, the ceasefire deal, which is extendable by design,
   could be the start of the runway for Netanyahu to end the war,” he said.

   Netanyahu has previously refused even to contemplate a ceasefire until all
   the hostages were released. However, he has faced mounting pressure at
   home from the hostage families, who recently staged a large march to
   Jerusalem to pressure his government on the matter.

   Orton noted that Netanyahu had no choice but to try any means to get the
   hostages home, given the strong demand among the Israeli public.
   Nevertheless, he believes the Israeli prime minister is “on a hiding to
   nothing” regarding the outcome.

   “If some of the hostages are recovered, this will be seen as no more than
   what he should be doing to correct a mistake of his own making since many
   in Israel blame him for not adequately preparing to prevent the Oct. 7
   pogrom,” he said.

   On the other hand, if it all goes wrong, that will be added to the
   extensive “political indictment” against Netanyahu.

   “If Netanyahu was going to be replaced before the war was over, that would
   probably have already happened,” Orton said. “But if this leads to some
   kind of disaster or if Netanyahu seems to be getting drawn into an
   open-ended ceasefire, the chances of a move against him from within the
   Cabinet increase.”

   Heras doubts the Israeli military leadership will want to cease targeted
   operations and strikes against the Hamas leadership and also wants to
   guarantee Hamas will not run Gaza after this war eventually comes to a
   formal end.

   “This reality, combined with the fact that the top echelon of Hamas
   military leaders in Gaza are still alive and will want to claim victory
   over Israel by surviving beyond the war, means that the situation is on
   the knife’s edge of returning to a full-blown war,” he said.

   NEW YORK (AP) — Oscar-winning actor Susan Sarandon and “Scream” star
   Melissa Barrera were each dropped by Hollywood companies after making
   comments on the Israel-Hamas war that some deemed antisemitic.

   Spyglass Media Group, the production company behind the upcoming “Scream
   VII,” acknowledged Barrera’s exit from the horror franchise. The
   Mexican-born actress, who starred in “In the Heights” and the two recent
   “Scream” installments, had posted statements on Instagram Stories calling
   the war “genocide and ethnic cleansing.”

   “Gaza,” she wrote, “is currently being treated like a concentration camp.”

   Spyglass said in a statement that its position “is unequivocally clear: We
   have zero tolerance for antisemitism or the incitement of hate in any
   form, including false references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, Holocaust
   distortion or anything that flagrantly crosses the line into hate speech.”

   Late Wednesday, Barrera posted a statement on Instagram Stories about her
   firing.

   “First and foremost I condemn antisemitism and Islamophobia. I condemn
   hate and prejudice of any kind against any group of people,” she wrote.

   “I believe a group of people are NOT their leadership, and that no
   governing body should be above criticism,” she added. “I pray day and
   night for no more deaths, for no more violence, and for peaceful
   co-existence. I will continue to speak out for those that need it most and
   continue to advocate for peace and safety, for human rights and freedom.”

   Earlier Wednesday, Deadline reported that Jenna Ortega, who played
   Barrera’s sister in the two previous “Scream” films, has exited the
   seventh installment. Ortega earlier departed the franchise because of her
   “Wednesday” schedule, the trade reported. A spokesperson for Ortega didn’t
   immediately respond to queries.

   A spokesman for the United Talent Agency said Sarandon, the five-time
   Oscar nominee, is no longer represented by the agency. Sarandon’s exit
   from UTA followed comments she’s made about Israel, most recently in an
   appearance Nov. 17 at a pro-Palestinian rally in New York.

   “There are a lot of people afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are
   getting a taste of what it feels like to be a Muslim in this country, so
   often subjected to violence,” Sarandon said, according to the New York
   Post.

   The Post reported that Sarandon joined the crowd in chanting “From the
   river to the sea, Palestine will be free” — a slogan some see as
   antisemitic because it suggests the eradication of Israel.

   Sarandon could not be reached for comment Wednesday. At the rally, she
   also was quoted as saying: “There’s a terrible thing that’s happened where
   antisemitism has been confused with speaking up against Israel. I am
   against antisemitism. I am against Islamophobia.”

   The Israel-Hamas war has caused rifts throughout Hollywood. Earlier, when
   many groups were issuing statements condemning Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on
   Israel, the Writers Guild of America ultimately didn’t after failing to
   come to an agreement. Maha Dakhil, a prominent agent with Creative Arts
   Agency, last month resigned her board seat after sharing a social media
   post accusing Israel of genocide. Dakhil apologized.

   Israel and Hamas on Wednesday agreed to a four-day cease-fire in the war
   in Gaza.

   Israel's Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi submitted a proposal to take
   action against Haaretz by ending the publication of government notices in
   Haaretz. Karhi, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud
   party, said the newspaper was "sabotaging Israel in wartime" and was an
   "inflammatory mouthpiece for Israel’s enemies."

   The proposal, which was submitted without being vetted by the ministry's
   legal adviser, would immediately halt any payments to Haaretz from any
   state entity within his purview.

   Haaretz publisher Amos Schocken responded to Karhi’s proposal by saying,
   “If the government wants to close Haaretz, that’s the time to read
   Haaretz.”

   Karhi's proposal, which would forbid the publication of official
   government notices in Haaretz, and would cancel all state employee Haaretz
   subscriptions – including those held by members of the IDF, the police,
   the prison service, government ministries and government companies – was
   sent to Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs.

   In a letter to Fuchs entitled, “Taking action against the Haaretz
   newspaper for the dissemination of lying, defeatist propaganda,” Karhi
   wrote: “Since the beginning of the war, I have received many complaints
   that Haaretz has taken an offensive line which undermines the war's goals
   and disparages the military effort and its social fortitude. It is
   possible that some of the paper's publications even cross the criminal
   standard set in those far-flung sections of the penal code reserved for
   wartime only.”

   Karhi added: “The State of Israel is one of Haaretz’s customers, and the
   government has the power to decide that it isn’t interested in being a
   customer of a newspaper that is sabotaging Israel in wartime and
   undermining the spirit of Israeli soldiers and civilians in the face of
   the enemy.” He noted he was still waiting for his ministry's legal adviser
   to offer an opinion regarding his proposal, “and I don’t know what it will
   be.”

   The Israeli journalists’ union said in a statement that “the
   communications minister has lost his way. Karhi, who spent most of his
   brief tenure in failed attempts to close the public broadcasting
   corporation, has decided to tame a new target. His new proposal to end all
   government business with Haaretz is a populistic proposal devoid of any
   feasibility or logic, and its entire purpose is to garner likes among his
   political base at the expense of dedicated journalists who are working
   night and day right now to cover the war."

   “We support Haaretz’s journalists, and we’re certain they will continue to
   do important work for the benefit of Israel and won’t be deterred by
   Minister Karhi’s stupid, empty threats,” it added.

   In his letter, Karhi cited the recently approved emergency regulations
   that allow the government to take action against foreign media outlets
   that harm the country.

   “It’s inconceivable that at a time when we are taking action against
   foreign stations, an Israeli newspaper should continue to get a
   significant share of its funding from the Israeli public while it serves
   as an inflammatory mouthpiece for Israel’s enemies,” he wrote.

   The security cabinet recently authorized Karhi to take action under these
   regulations against Al Mayadeen, a Lebanese television station affiliated
   with Hezbollah that also reports from Israel, on the grounds that it harms
   national security and serves a terrorist organization. Karhi subsequently
   signed an order blocking the station’s internet channel in Israel and
   asked the army to issue a closure order for its offices in the West Bank.

   However, the cabinet refused to approve his request to close the Qatari
   station Al Jazeera, in part because of Qatar’s involvement in negotiations
   for the release of the hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

   Prominent journalists from around the world have denounced Karhi's
   threats. CNN's Jake Tapper tweeted: "A push to undermine the free press
   from the Netanyahu government." The Nation's Jeet Heer wrote: "Haaretz is
   a great newspaper, needed now more than ever." Yashar Ali, who writes for
   the Huffington Post and the New York Magazine, wrote in response: "I just
   subscribed."

  Where things stand

       Hostage deal: A hotly anticipated hostage deal between Hamas and
       Israel - which includes a four-day pause to fighting - has been left
       up in the air. Hamas had announced there'd be a four-day pause
       beginning at 10am on Thursday - but an Israeli source has since told
       the BBC there's been a setback.

       It came after a security adviser to the Israeli government said
       there'd be no Israeli hostages released by Hamas before Friday.

       Criticism of pause time: Families of those being held in Gaza have
       said every captive "needs to come home", but the UN's Palestinian
       refugee agency Unrwa said a four-day pause - in which more aid would
       be allowed to go into the enclave - is simply not enough.

       Aid crisis: Lorries carrying aid are now queuing up at the Rafah
       crossing from Egypt into Gaza in anticipation of the pause in
       hostilities. Earlier, the executive director of Unicef - the UN's
       agency for children - said Gaza now faces a crisis of "child wasting"
       - a term used to describe the most life-threatening form of
       malnutrition.

       Fighting continues: On the ground, Israel has continued its ground and
       air operation in Gaza - and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
       vowed to win "absolute victory" over Hamas. Meanwhile, Israeli defence
       minister Yoav Gallant said Israel is "slowly but surely" dismantling
       the military framework of Hamas.

       What happens now? Our colleagues on the ground are continuing to
       gather information about the hostage deal and what its potential delay
       means.

  Hezbollah says son of senior lawmaker killed in Israeli strike

       Five members of Hezbollah - the powerful Iranian-backed militia in
       Lebanon - have been killed in an Israeli strike in Beit Yahoun, south
       Lebanon, according to the Shia Islamist group.

       Abbas Raad, son of senior Hezbollah figure and Lebanese lawmaker
       Mohammad Raad was one of them, the group says.

       According to Reuters news agency, a total of 85 Hezbollah fighters
       have now been killed since violence broke out along the Israel-Lebanon
       border.

       Israel's army said it struck several Hezbollah targets in Lebanon on
       Wednesday evening, including "terror infrastructure" and "terror
       cells" that tried to launch rockets into Israel and fired at Israeli
       troops.

       Hezbollah is the largest political and military force in Lebanon. It
       is classed as a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and the Arab
       League.

  More than 50 from same family killed in Gaza, says Palestinian Authority

       As we've been reporting, the agreed pause in fighting is yet to begin
       - and Palestinian news agency Wafa has reported dozens of people
       killed in Israeli attacks on Wednesday.

       The foreign minister of the Palestinian Authority (PA), Riyad
       al-Maliki, has said 52 of those killed in the Jabalia refugee camp in
       northern Gaza on Wednesday morning belonged to the same family.

       "Only this morning, from the Qadoura family in Jabalia, 52 people have
       been wiped out completely, killed," he said during a trip to London.

       "I have the list of the names, 52 of them, they were wiped out
       completely from grandfather to grandchildren."

       The BBC has not been able to verify this independently. As a reminder,
       the PA is based in the occupied West Bank and is entirely separate to
       Hamas.

  Who are the hostages taken by Hamas?

       Ditza Heiman

       The BBC has been tracking reports and stories of the people taken
       hostage by Hamas.

       It says it has hidden the hostages in "safe places and tunnels" within
       Gaza. Israel Defense Forces have previously said the hostages include
       children, and between 10 and 20 over-60s.

       One of those was Ditza Heiman, 84.

       She was seen by a neighbour at kibbutz Nir Oz being led away by Hamas
       gunmen, her niece said.

       A former social worker, she is the widow of Zvi Shdaimah, who came to
       the UK on the Kindertransport, the organised rescue of children from
       Nazi-controlled areas during World War Two.

  Israeli government says it believes releasing Palestinians right move to get
  hostages home

       Eylon Levy
       BBCCopyright: BBC

       A little earlier and before we got the news that the release of some
       hostages and pause in fighting will not take place before Friday, a
       spokesperson for the Israeli government spoke to our colleagues on the
       BBC News channel.

       Asked what he made of the hostage deal that's been agreed between
       Hamas and Israel, Eylon Levy described it as a "very difficult
       situation" - and said it won't be easy for Israel to let "terrorists"
       go.

       As part of the deal, which will see a four-day pause in the fighting -
       now not expected to begin before Friday - Hamas will release 50
       Israeli hostages taken during the 7 October attacks in exchange for
       150 Palestinian women and teenagers who've been held in Israeli jails.

       Levy says some of the people being released have committed "security
       offences" - including "stabbing and shooting attacks". Despite this,
       he says, the government believes this is the right move to get
       hostages being held home.

       "We have an obligation as a country to bring them home safely," Levy
       says. "We're looking forward to seeing them come home."

  A significant delay to the hostage deal

       Tom Bateman

       Middle East correspondent, in Jerusalem

       The sense had been all day in Israel that, according to the agreement,
       it would be 10:00 local time on Thursday (08:00 GMT) that a ceasefire
       would begin.

       A couple of hours after that, you'd get the release of the first batch
       of hostages held by Hamas - and then Palestinian prisoners held by
       Israel would also be freed.

       But more uncertainty appeared when Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman
       for the Israeli military, gave a briefing a few hours ago and said he
       didn’t know what time a ceasefire might start.

       We've now heard the head of Israel's National Security Council say
       that the negotiations are progressing and continuing - but hostages
       won't be released before Friday.

       That appears to be quite a significant delay - anything from 24 hours
       or even beyond - to plans that had been widely briefed and which we
       understood would be taking place tomorrow.

  Ceasefire also delayed

       Orla Guerin

       Reporting from Jerusalem

       An Israeli government source has told the BBC that the ceasefire has
       also been delayed.

  Israeli source says there are minor issues to work though

       Orla Guerin

       Reporting from Jerusalem

       This is certainly a change at the 11th hour. Israel was gearing up for
       a hostage release as early as tomorrow morning.

       There are conflicting reports here about what has caused the setback;
       some claims that Hamas has not ratified the ceasefire agreement.

       Other reports say Hamas has not provided Israel with a list of the
       hostages who were to be released on the first day. And that mechanism
       is supposed to be part of the agreement.

       An Israeli government source told me in the last half hour that they
       believed these were relatively minor issues which need to be ironed
       out, and that they would be ironed out on Thursday. That suggests that
       things would be back on track on Friday if that is the case.

       But what we can say for certain is that this is an awful blow to the
       families. They’ve been waiting almost 50 days, hoping that tomorrow
       was finally going to bring a moment of hope.

       Now once again they have to deal with uncertainty. And I think many of
       them will believe this deal is only happening when they see it.

  BreakingSenior Israeli official says no hostages will be released before
  Friday

       In the last few minutes, Tzachi Hanegbi, head of the National Security
       Council of Israel, has said Israeli hostages will not be released by
       Hamas before Friday.

       "The negotiations for the release of our hostages are advancing and
       continuing constantly," he adds in a statement released by the office
       of Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu.

       It was announced last night that Israel and Hamas had reached a deal
       to exchange 50 of the hostages held in Gaza for a four-day pause in
       fighting.

       The agreement will also see 150 Palestinian women and children held in
       Israeli jails released and an increase in humanitarian aid allowed
       into Gaza.

  UN agency says a four-day pause is not enough time

       We've been hearing from the UN's Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa
       about its hopes for the four-day pause in fighting under the
       Israel-Hamas deal.

       The agency is currently hosting close to a million people in its
       shelters, a spokeswoman has told the BBC.

       Tamara Alrifa says the agency needs to be able to go to the northern
       part of Gaza - an area that Israel has urged Gazans to leave for their
       own safety. It will be able do so during the pause in fighting "if the
       Israeli authorities give us security guarantees".

       Alrifa says Unrwa would like to send mobile clinics into shelters and
       distribute bread, flour and drinking water in the north, as it has
       been doing in the south, but four days is "definitely not enough for
       the scale and scope of the humanitarian catastrophe".

       She says the 200 trucks carrying aid that will be allowed in each of
       the four days are "very insufficient", given that around 500 trucks
       used to enter Gaza per day.

       The four fuel tankers permitted to enter under the deal will bring
       about half of what Unrwa needs to run its trucks, electricity
       generators, water pumping and desalination plants, and to provide fuel
       to hospitals and bakeries, she adds.

  Gaza facing child malnutrition crisis - Unicef boss

       A boy cycling through the Gazan city of Rafah todayImage caption: A
       boy cycling through the Gazan city of Rafah today

       Back to the situation in Gaza Strip itself now. The executive director
       of Unicef - the UN's agency for children - says the territory faces a
       crisis of "child wasting": a term used to describe the most
       life-threatening form of malnutrition.

       In an article published in the New York Times today, Catherine Russell
       said Unicef was projecting that the rate of child wasting would
       increase 30% in the next few months - and there were already more than
       7,000 cases before the events of 7 October. She added that these were
       conservative estimates, and the figure could rise as the conflict
       continued.

       Severe wasting means even catching a common cold could be life
       threatening, Russell explained.

       It's hoped that the hostage deal agreed by Israel and Hamas -
       following negotiations backed by Qatar and the US - will allow
       hundreds of lorries carrying aid to enter Gaza over four days.

       Russell says to ensure Gaza's children remain healthy and stave off
       looming health issues, humanitarian partners must be permitted to
       deliver supplies after hostilities resume.

  ICRC earlier said it wasn't notified of hostages visit

       As we just reported, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says
       humanitarian workers from the International Committee of the Red Cross
       (ICRC) will be able to visit hostages in Gaza who are not being
       released under the imminent deal between Israel and Hamas.

       Netanyahu disputed an earlier comment from the ICRC - which said the
       organisation hadn't received any information about visiting hostages
       in Gaza.

       In its statement (quoted by Israeli media) the ICRC said it had
       continuously asked for the release of all hostages and for their
       humane treatment since the brutal 7 October attack. But, it added:

         Quote Message: Thus far, the ICRC has not been made aware of any
         agreement reached by both parties related to visits by the ICRC to
         the hostages. Should visits be agreed upon, the ICRC stands ready to
         visit. The ICRC does not take part in the negotiations between the
         parties to the conflict." from International Committee of the Red
         Cross

         Thus far, the ICRC has not been made aware of any agreement reached
         by both parties related to visits by the ICRC to the hostages.
         Should visits be agreed upon, the ICRC stands ready to visit. The
         ICRC does not take part in the negotiations between the parties to
         the conflict."

         International Committee of the Red Cross

       We've approached the ICRC for comment on those latest comments from
       Netanyahu.

       During that press conference, we also heard Israeli Prime Minister
       Benjamin Netanyahu say it's been agreed that humanitarian workers from
       the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) will be allowed to
       visit remaining hostages in Gaza.

       "I expect the Red Cross to do its job, and to visit them all and to

  Gantz says Israel 'slowly but surely' dismantling Hamas

       We're now hearing from Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant, who says
       the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has been working very hard in the Gaza
       Strip - from land, air and sea.

       Gallant says Israel is "slowly but surely" dismantling the military
       framework of Hamas.

       The defence minister says he recommended to the Israeli parliament
       that the IDF should go further into Gaza - to show Hamas the powers of
       Israel's military and rescue hostages.

       He says that he "sincerely" hopes that the hostage release agreement
       "will be actually executed". And he hopes the results of negotiations
       will be seen in "next few days".

  Netanyahu: 'The victory has a very heavy price'

       Israel Government Press OfficeCopyright: Israel Government Press
       Office

       Netanyahu says Israel will continue to fight Hamas in the north and in
       the south, which has only been possible "thanks to the heroism and the
       courage of our children".

       He adds: "This victory has a very heavy price to pay," and
       acknowledges that some members of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will
       die during the war.

       He says he has been told by the families of soldiers killed in combat
       to continue fighting.

  Post update

       Netanyahu says he expects some mothers and children to be released.

       "There were various things we just had to do," Netanyahu adds. He says
       in his job he sometimes has to make "extremely tough" decisions.

       He says Israel is taking advantage of every possible chance to bring
       hostages safely home.

       The PM says he was reassured during meetings yesterday that the safety
       of Israeli soldiers will be guaranteed during the "temporary truce".

       The Israeli military will then continue its campaign against Hamas, he
       says.

       Israeli Prime Minister Benajmin Netanyahu is first up, and addressing
       the public.

       He repeats that the aims of this war are to release the hostages and

       military) for its work, and role in the war so far.

       Talking about the conditions of the hostage release, he says no
       murderers will be released from Israeli jails.

       Academic Webinar: The Geopolitics of Oil

       Carolyn Kissane, academic director and clinical professor at the
       Center for Global Affairs at New York University, leads the
       conversation on the geopolitics of oil.   FASKIANOS: Thank you.
       Welcome to the final session of the Winter/Spring 2023 CFR Academic
       Webinar Series. I’m Irina Faskianos, vice president of the National
       Program and Outreach here at CFR. Today’s discussion is on the record.
       And the video and transcript will be available on our website,
       CFR.org/Academic, if you would like to share these materials with your
       colleagues or classmates. As always, CFR takes no institutional
       positions on matters of policy. We are delighted to have Carolyn
       Kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil. Dr. Kissane is the
       academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and
       the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at
       NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, where she is also a clinical
       professor. She also serves as director of the energy, climate justice,
       and sustainability lab in the School of Professional Studies at NYU.
       She was named in 2013 by Breaking Energy as one of the top ten New
       York women in energy, and top ten energy communicator. She’s a member
       of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on
       U.S.-China Relations, and serves on several boards. So, Carolyn,
       thanks very much for doing this. We really appreciate it. I thought we
       could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed,
       especially vis-à-vis Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s recent
       announcement to cut oil production? KISSANE: Well, first of all, I’d
       just like to say, thank you so very much for having me. I’m really
       delighted. I am a big fan of CFR’s Academic Webinars. So, to have the
       opportunity to participate in this—in this way is very meaningful to
       me. So, thank you. So, wow. There is so much happening in this space,
       the geopolitics of oil. This has been a tremendous fourteen months.
       Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of
       oil because Russia is a significant producer, one of the top three in
       the world. And it’s—you know, it’s caused a kind of a reshaping, a
       kind of a remapping of the—of oil geopolitics. And we’ve seen some,
       you know, shifts in how countries think about oil security, in light
       of larger questions about broader energy security questions. And also,
       on top of that, is the ongoing energy transition, coupled with, you
       know, climate change, and the need to decarbonize. So, there’s
       just—it’s been quite a—you know, a year and a half, that has really
       sort of put energy security, and oil security, very much at the
       forefront of people’s minds. FASKIANOS: Fantastic. I thought maybe you
       had some really interesting data to show us. And if you could walk us
       through those—the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life,
       that would be fantastic. KISSANE: Sure. So, before I do—I have a
       couple of slides. And before I share my slides, I think it’s really
       important that, sort of, we understand how interconnected, sort of,
       the global energy system is, and how interconnected we are, when it
       comes to the flows of oil. You know, some countries are very well
       resourced-endowed, so they have oil. And other countries do not, so
       they need to import oil. There’s really no country in the world that
       doesn’t need oil for larger national security issues. And I think one
       of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or
       think about, is the amount of oil that gets produced every day. So,
       every day, the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day. And
       every day, that 100 million barrels has to be—has to be moved. It has
       to be—you know, as part of getting it into the system, getting it to
       its respective destinations. And what we’re not seeing—which, maybe
       some people may have thought that we would see at this point—is we’re
       not seeing a reduction in demand, but we’re seeing an expansion in
       demand. And much of that global demand is coming out of Asia. And
       we’re also, of course, seeing the—with the reopening of China, lots of
       really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in China
       for the 2023-2024 years, whether or not they will—they will, sort of,
       put extra pressure on global demand. And you know, Irina, just also,
       you know, it’s—I’m going to share this in my slides. But you know,
       last week’s decision from OPEC+ to reduce production, of course, had
       an impact on the price of oil. So when the decision was announced on
       Sunday, by Monday morning, we saw an uptick in the price. It’s
       stabilized, but we are sort of looking at $80-plus-a-barrel oil. And
       again, lots of uncertainty as to what that’s going to mean across
       economies that are in recessions, experiencing sort of the beginnings
       of a recession, and sort of what does it mean for the global economy,
       where we may see sort of more energy inflation. So, one of the things
       that I really like to do when I teach the geopolitics of oil is sort
       of show some visuals. Because I think, again, sort of, really
       reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system, but
       also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced, and where in
       the world are the—are the importers. And also, just a couple of sort
       of fun pieces on what we have seen, just this—you know, in the last
       week, of course, some of this—you’ll be familiar with, those in the
       audience—but this decision on the part of OPEC to reduce production by
       1.2 million barrels a day—again, happening at a time, not when we have
       an excess supply, but when we’re seeing a tight supply across the oil
       market. So, it came as a bit of a surprise to—you know—to even the
       most, you know, longstanding analysts and OPEC observers. And again,
       part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of
       Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the
       cuts. But of course, it also has an impact here for those of you that
       are sitting in the United States. What does it mean then for prices
       that Americans pay at the gas pump? So, the Biden administration sort
       of came out after this decision was made in sort of being
       disappointed, surprised that OPEC would make this decision. Now, it’s
       also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular
       OPEC decision. This is part of, now, a larger OPEC+. And OPEC+ does
       also include Russia, as well as other countries like Kazakhstan and
       Mexico. So, the OPEC that we have historically known is now different,
       because you have other countries that are not official members but
       nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as OPEC+. And these are
       the countries that are part of OPEC, and really the country that’s
       considered to be sort of in the driver’s seat of OPEC is that of Saudi
       Arabia, because Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the OPEC
       organization, producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day.
       Venezuela has the largest reserves, but it is far from being at
       capacity, in terms of what it can—what it can produce. So, just to
       kind of put that into perspective, these are OPEC countries and their
       respective reserves. And then non-OPEC—the United States being a
       non-OPEC country, but again, this sort of—this chart to the right
       shows, you know, again, the world is consuming a little over 100
       million barrels a day, expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024,
       question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand. But again, to
       sort of link this to energy security—energy security, especially when
       it’s in the context of oil security—is making sure that we have
       adequate supply at affordable prices. So, when we see a reduction in
       supply at a time of tight markets, that suggests that we’re also going
       to see higher prices that’s going to directly hit vulnerable
       economies. And so, again, just to sort of point out sort of where in
       the world sort of are the top three oil producers: the United States,
       Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Russia remains in the top three. Canada as
       well, our, you know, neighbor to the north. And China is also a
       producer of oil. The United States figure here also includes gas
       liquefied, so liquid petroleum, which the United States is endowed
       with a lot of both oil and natural gas. And then the top oil consuming
       countries, you have U.S., China, and India. Now, the United States is
       not the largest importer. That position is now held by China. But as
       far as consumption goes, we consume over 20 million barrels a day.
       Again, big question mark about China, in terms of whether or not we
       will see higher demand coming out of China over the next year, two
       years, with China’s reopening and what is being, you know, discussed
       as revenge tourism. And more Chinese who have accumulated a lot of
       savings, 2.1 trillion, how are they going to use that savings and
       whether or not, after three years of being under lockdown
       restrictions, whether or not we’ll see impacts to demand. And I think
       Russia is—there’s lots of questions about Russia. And this is
       now—we’re fourteen months into, you know, Russia’s reinvasion of
       Ukraine—and I emphasize reinvasion, because oftentimes, we forget
       that, you know, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. But Russia is still
       moving its oil. And up until, you know, a few months ago, its overall
       production and exports were as high—at some points, even higher—than
       pre-invasion. Now, you have new countries that are takers of Russian
       oil, and they’re buying it at discounted prices. We see Turkey,
       Singapore, China has been a big buyer, as well as India, that they
       have been buying discounted Russian oil. Lots of interesting questions
       that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to
       Europe. But I think the takeaway from this slide is that Russia
       continues to produce oil, continues to sell it, selling at a
       discounted price, but there are still many countries in the world that
       are eager to take Russian oil. And again, I’m not going to go into
       this, but I just love this slide, to just emphasize the—you know, the
       world’s pipelines. These are the pipelines that help sort of the
       transit of oil. Something also that’s really unique and interesting to
       look at is just tanker traffic, so, the tankers that carry oil around
       the world. But again, you know, there are a lot of pipelines, so
       twenty-three—two thousand, three hundred, and eighty-one operational
       oil and gas pipelines. Again, these are—it’s moving a lot of the oil
       that is consumed every day. And then finally, is this—is—you know, one
       of the things that we oftentimes—we think about the hundred million
       barrels a day that the world is consuming, over 75 percent of the
       world’s oil is controlled, managed by state-owned oil companies. So,
       Saudi Aramco being one, PDVSA of Venezuela being another. But it’s
       really important to sort of recognize the position that state-owned
       companies have. The rest is controlled or managed by international oil
       companies—ExxonMobil, Chevron, ENI, Total, and a host of other—host of
       other companies. But again, I think the—you know, to understand that
       NOCs, as they’re referred to, are very, very important for
       understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of
       oil. And again, what we saw last week coming out of OPEC, this
       decision, this is also being driven by state budget concerns. This
       is—again, it’s about the production of oil, but it’s also about, you
       know, governments and their budgets. And oftentimes, you know, there
       is a desire to add more, rather than—you know, more revenues rather
       than less. So, those are the slides that I have. And I hope that they
       sort of provide some sort of context, and a little bit of, you know,
       that we can discuss in the questions that I really look forward to
       answering from the audience. FASKIANOS: Thank you, Carolyn. That was
       great. So now, we’re going to go to all of you for your questions and
       comments. (Gives queuing instructions.) All right, so I’m going to go
       to the first raised hand in the thing. Amadine Hom, go to you first,
       and please accept the—unmute yourself. (Pause.) You are still muted.
       (Pause.) OK, I don’t know—are you there? Oh, I think—OK. Let’s go to
       Morton Holbrook. Q: Yes, good afternoon. Dr. Kissane, what a shocking
       presentation—(laughs)—a hundred million barrels a day and it’s going
       up, notwithstanding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Is that
       agreement simply a dead letter, or is it having any effect on oil—on
       fossil fuel production, particularly oil production? Or what’s the
       best scenario, in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels,
       considering the oil market? Thank you. KISSANE: Well—hi, Morton, thank
       you so much for that excellent question. Yeah, that’s kind of why I
       emphasize that number, is because a lot of people sort of just aren’t
       aware of how much oil we continue to consume, and again, what the
       demand expectations are moving forward. And these demand expectations
       are, you know, coming out of forecasts from the International Energy
       Agency. So, I think there’s a big question as to when we see peak
       demand. And, you know, if you look at BP scenarios, they expect peak
       demand to happen, you know, before 2030, where, as, you know, others
       kind of contest that they—that they think that peak demand won’t
       happen until after 2030. I mean, again, a lot depends on, you know,
       what we are now experiencing in the energy transition, and how, sort
       of quickly are we—can we transition away from oil. I think what’s
       really critical, when we’re looking at oil, is oftentimes we think
       only about the transportation sector. So we’re thinking about cars,
       we’re thinking about planes, you know, we’re thinking about trucks,
       and tankers, and all these things. But it’s petrochemicals, you know?
       There’s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer. So, it
       really is across our economy, and across economies, across the global
       system. One of the things that I always tell my students is even
       during COVID, where you had many countries, right, much of the world
       was experiencing some level of lockdown, we did have a reduction in
       oil demand, but it wasn’t—it wasn’t like 20 million barrels. It was
       under ten. So, the fact that now it’s 2023, the world has reopened,
       it’s really hard to sort of see, or to know with certainty, is when
       we’re going to see that—see that reduction in demand. Now, I think
       with the Paris Agreement, what’s also important is—to note is, you
       know, if you’re—if you’re in the oil and gas space—and I was just at a
       conference earlier this morning where this was a point of
       conversation—was, you know, what are the companies doing to reduce the
       emissions from production? So, how are they integrating carbon
       capture, sequestration, you know, how are they managing the emissions
       that come from the production of fossil energy—in this case that we’re
       talking about, oil. And I think one of the things that—I think if you
       sort of follow oil markets, or a country like Saudi Arabia, they are
       marketing low-emission oil. Now, we could—you know, we could sort of
       challenge, well, what does that—you know, what does that really mean?
       But you are having, you know, countries that are now sort of competing
       to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production—in the
       production of oil. And that’s a whole other interesting sort of thing
       to look at, in the context of the geopolitics of oil, is to kind of
       understand the variation across emissions, across different countries,
       in the production of oil. So, we are—you know, again, we are going to
       be going into COP-28 this fall. Again, we are not seeing—you know, and
       we haven’t seen a, you know, reduction in fossil energy demand. Again,
       lots of people are sort of, you know, hoping that we’ll start to see
       it sooner rather than later. But for the time being—and again, you
       know, to Irina’s first question, that, you know, the last fourteen
       months, and with, you know, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has
       both shown us that, you know, Europe is sort of seeking to hasten the
       energy transition, by building out more renewable energy, and creating
       more opportunities to buy electric vehicles. But there’s still big
       swaths of the world that, you know, are still, and have yet to move
       towards, you know, really reducing—and that are actually going to see
       higher demand moving forward, as their economies grow. FASKIANOS:
       Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Jovana Vujanic,
       who is a graduate student at Lewis University: How big of an—of an
       impact will the decision of the Saudi energy minister to cut oil
       production have on the relationship between the United States and
       Saudi Arabia? KISSANE: Love the question, thank you so much. Yeah, no,
       it’s a great one. So, my take is that, of course, this decision came
       as a bit of a surprise, and it wasn’t something that the United
       States, you know, wanted. But I would say that the U.S.-Saudi
       relationship has been very tense for the last ten years. And as part
       of that—there are lots of different reasons for that, but this is
       yet—kind of another thing that Saudi has done. And again, I think it’s
       also—Saudi has taken a non-alignment policy with relation to its
       position on Russia and Ukraine. So, it continues to—you know, it
       continues to have a relationship with Russia. It also has the
       relationship with Ukraine. As we saw, you know, China just brokered a
       very significant deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, again,
       Saudi Arabia and Iran are two—are two important producers for China.
       So, China is a large importer of oil. So, if you go back to World
       War—the end of World War II, that’s when the United States established
       the oil-for-security relationship with Saudi Arabia. And as we have
       grown, sort of, more—I wouldn’t say independent, but our—as our own
       oil production has increased, especially through the shale revolution,
       our dependence on the Middle East and Saudi Arabia, more specifically,
       has shifted. So, I think we’re seeing a very different Saudi Arabia
       today, which I think is going to be a challenge for the United States.
       I think it’s going to be very interesting to see what the summer
       holds. Last summer, the Biden administration did tap into the U.S.
       strategic petroleum reserves, the largest—the largest take in the
       history of the reserves, which started in 1975, you know, taking 180
       million barrels out, you know, not because there was massive supply
       disruptions. But because, you know, as the administration said, it
       was—you know, it was—it was—it was a war—it was a war-specific
       decision, because the—you know, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was
       causing energy prices to skyrocket. And to cushion the American
       consumer, and to better cushion the, sort of, the global economy, the
       United States withdrew from the SPR. So I think the summer is going to
       be very interesting. But I think we’re going to see, definitely, much
       more attention in the years to come, between the United States and
       Saudi Arabia. It’s not the relationship of the past. This is a kind of
       a very new relationship. That’s a great question. FASKIANOS: Thank
       you. Thank you, let’s go Curran Flynn, who has a raised hand.  Q:
       Hello? FASKIANOS: We can hear you, but we’re getting feedback. So you
       might have two devices open. Q: Can you hear me now? FASKIANOS: Yes.
       Q: That’s better. OK. FASKIANOS: That’s better. Thank you. Thank you
       so much. Q: So, I’m here at King Fahd University in Saudi Arabia,
       right next to Aramco, here with my class from international relations.
       And one of my students has a question, Nasser al-Nasir (ph). Here he
       is. Q: So, thank you, Mrs. Carolyn. My question is: How could Russia’s
       use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian
       Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. market, the domestic market, and
       the role of the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from
       Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers through their RDIF
       fund? And thank you to Mrs. Irina. KISSANE: Thank you. And, Dr. Flynn,
       thank you so much for having your students join this webinar. So, I’m
       a little—so, the question is about the East Siberian Pipeline? Just
       could you—would you mind repeating it? I just want to make sure I have
       it—I’m clear on the question. Q: So, how could Russia’s use of
       alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline
       to China, impact the U.S. energy markets, I mean domestically, and the
       SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as
       ensuring Russian tankers to the RDIF fund? KISSANE: Yeah, and that’s a
       great question. You know, I think that, you know, begs a lot of things
       that we could be looking at, right, in terms of, you know, Russia’s
       kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around, or find
       workarounds, to the sanctions that were imposed. And I think we’ve
       seen sort of new markets—so, this kind of reshaping of the energy map
       with oil, we see that as—kind of in technicolor, right, whereas, you
       know, a lot of Russian oil would go west, is now going east, you know,
       China, India, being takers, and of course, you know, other countries
       as well. You know, what will be its impact on the—on the U.S. market?
       I think that’s—you know, again, I do think the sanctions were sort of
       carefully put into place, so that there wouldn’t be massive
       disruptions, so we—again, you know, Russia produces over 10 million
       barrels a day, and about 7 million of those barrels are exported. So,
       you know, if we lost all of that, that would be a—you know, that would
       cause some very significant economic disruption globally. We already
       saw, you know, impacts to sort of grains, grain exports, and food
       security in many different parts of the world. So, you know, Russia is
       finding different ways. You have shadow tankers that Russia is using
       to move—to move its oil—as you pointed out, the East Siberian
       pipeline. You know, I think there’s only so much the United States can
       do, or—and European countries that are part of the sanctions regime,
       can do to curtail Russian exports of oil. But I think that—you know, I
       think Russia, again, has a—has a desire, and also, you know, revenue
       needs—they’re funding a very expensive war—that they’re finding ways
       to get their—to get their oil out. I think an interesting question is,
       you know, what does this mean in the years ahead, the lack of
       investment, for example, that’s going into Russian energy
       infrastructure, a lack of, sort of, any kind of Western investment
       that is—that is going in, and what that is going to mean. But again,
       you know, I think, to your question, I think we will see some—you
       know, we are seeing some impacts, right? There’s a big question as to
       what—you know, what the next six months to a year will look like, with
       regards to the reduction from OPEC, and if we were to see a deeper
       curtailment on Russian oil. And you know, would the United States then
       tap more into the SPR? We’re now at—you know, we’re down to seven
       hundred thousand barrels, which, of course, is not insignificant. But
       we also sort of have to be, you know, judicious about how we use the
       SPR. But thank you for the question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going
       to take the next question from Michael—let’s see— Trevett, a Ph.D.
       candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi: China and other
       countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the South China
       Sea. What are your estimates of the potential amount there, and has
       China begun to extract any of this oil? KISSANE: Michael, thank you so
       much. That’s a great question. So, China already is an oil producing
       country, so you do have oil production in China. In the South China
       Sea, I can’t—I can’t say exactly. I know that there have been
       geological tests that have shown the reserves. Again, you do have—you
       know, you do have territorial concerns about sort of where—is this—you
       know, can China—can China tap those—or seek to explore and tap those
       reserves, again, if there are—if there is contention over the
       territory in which these reserves are located? So you know, China,
       again—one of the things that’s very interesting about China is that
       China is an oil producer, but China has seen, over the last, you know,
       the last decade, they have seen that they have experienced peak
       demand. So—I mean, sorry. Peak supply. So, they are not producing as
       much as they used to. And so you’re seeing a year-on-year reduction in
       the producing capacity. You know, if you go back maybe five or six
       years ago, there was lots of questions about if China could kind of
       replicate what happened in the United States around the shale oil
       revolution. I think one of the big challenges for China is that, of
       the—you know, where the shale reserves are located, it’s not near
       water, lots of questions as to—and some of it—basically, some of the
       tests have shown that it’s—it definitely is proving harder that, you
       know, they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we
       have seen in the United States. So, yeah, no, I think in the South
       China Sea, again, I think we—it’s potentially possible that we might
       see it. I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s soon. FASKIANOS:
       Thank you. I’m taking the next question from Rob Warren at the
       Anglo-American University of Prague. This question also got an upvote:
       How do you foresee Venezuela’s role in the global oil market changing
       moving forward? And can it be reintegrated into the global economy?
       KISSANE: Oh, these are all fantastic questions. Thank you all so much.
       Yeah, Venezuela is—again, you know, Venezuela has—they have the
       largest reserves in the world. As part of this webinar, right, you—CFR
       had a—kind of a primer on Venezuelan, and kind of—you know, you look
       at sort of where Venezuela is. And one of the biggest challenges
       confronting Venezuela is both its politics, but it’s also—it
       basically—you know, you don’t have—you don’t have international oil
       service providers in the country. I think the only—the only one now
       that the U.S.—the U.S. has sort of given a sanctions exemption to, is
       that of Chevron. But I think—yeah, I mean, if you were to see, you
       know, kind of shifts in the political regime, and you were to see more
       openness, then I think you could imagine, you know, Venezuela having
       an opportunity, or a pathway forward, to be more integrated into the
       global energy system, and the global oil system. You know, I think one
       of the big problems that Venezuela faces is that most of its
       infrastructure is really old at this point. And it would need a
       significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it
       could sort of meet its potential. So, you know, Venezuela is one of
       these countries that’s not producing as much as it could, right? It
       has the potential to be producing 2 million-plus more barrels per day.
       But you know, we’ve seen that they really have just—they went into
       freefall. So, I think that’s a big issue. And another big issue,
       which—God, it goes back to an earlier question—is that of emissions.
       So, the oil that comes out of Venezuela is a very, very heavy oil. So,
       it’s—it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production
       of that oil. So, that, I think, is—again, as we—you know, think about
       the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of
       seeking to kind of market themselves as low-emission producers, you
       know, Venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping
       its—where its oil sector was. Again, it has the capacity, it has the
       reserves. But getting that—getting that oil out of the ground right
       now, you have a lot of significant above-ground risks. FASKIANOS:
       Thank you. I’m going to go next to Clemente Abrokwaa. Raised hand, so
       please unmute yourself. Q: Can you hear me, please? FASKIANOS: Yes, we
       can. Q: Thank you. Thank you so much for your—for your talk. I was
       also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every
       day. (Laughs.) I didn’t know that. But anyway, I’m from Penn State
       University. And my question is: You just mentioned about the
       above-ground, you know, effects. And—so the movement towards, like,
       electric vehicles and so on, how do you think it is going to affect
       the African continent? KISSANE: Thank you. Q: I am—I’m thinking, you
       know, the economies, and then infrastructure. It will be very
       difficult for them to—(laughs)—move with the rest of the world in
       terms of electric vehicles, and so on. I just wanted your take on
       that. KISSANE: Thank you, Clemente. It’s an excellent question. Yeah,
       I mean, you have countries across the African continent that not only
       have oil reserves, but are already producing, right? Nigeria is a—is
       an oil-producing country, also has more capacity, but again, you have
       some above-ground risks. You also have the need for investment of new
       infrastructure. I think one of the things that has been very
       interesting—and I think it’s getting—it’s getting more attention, as
       it deserves, is how Western governments are—some of—I think a
       challenge across Africa is that a lot of Western governments have sort
       of said, listen, we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels—or also,
       financial institutions, Western financial institutions—we’re not going
       to invest in fossil fuels, or new projects that are fossil-based. And
       that—you know, that’s problematic when you look across the African
       continent, where you still don’t have, you know, 100 percent energy
       access. You know, the idea of the transition to electric vehicles,
       which is taking a very, very long time, even here across the—across
       developed economies—so the need for the infusion of more capital to go
       into, you know, across the continent of Africa for oil and gas, that’s
       for their economies and for their own economic growth, I think, is
       really, really pivotal. And I think this is something that, you know,
       is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions. And
       also, you know, is it hypocrisy, right, for Western banks that have,
       you know, kind of funded the oil and gas industry, or helped to fund
       the oil and gas industry in the United States and many different parts
       of the world, and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to
       flow to Africa. And they have the—again, they have the—they have the
       resources. So you know, is it—you know, the equity of some of these
       decisions that are being made, I think, is one that’s—is one that’s
       really important. And again, I—you know, I said earlier in this talk,
       is that, you know, all—most of the demand for oil is not coming from
       North America and from Europe. All of the demand that we’re seeing and
       new demand that we’re going to see, is coming from Asia, and is going
       to come from Africa. So again, you know, how are we going to make sure
       that that demand is met, again, going back to that idea of energy
       security, so there is—there is accessibility, so there is reliable
       sources of energy at affordable prices, you know, without sort of
       thinking about kind of a whole-of-energy approach. So, I think it’s
       very—it’s a very complex issue. And I think, you know, Western banks
       who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will
       not fund, when it comes to new oil and gas projects, are getting sort
       of challenged as to, you know, what does that mean, then, for, you
       know, countries across Africa that are still very much in need of more
       energy, not less. And again, recognizing that, you know, EVs that,
       again, are still—are—you know, we’re seeing adoption here in the
       United States and across Europe, but it’s a big, big, big adoption in
       China. But it’s very uneven. So how do we ensure greater energy
       security for the continent of Africa, I think, is a really critical
       question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’ll take the next question from Kyle
       Bales, who is a senior at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois:
       How is the war between Russia and Ukraine having an effect on the
       progress of the European Green Deal? Maybe you can tell us what the
       European—define the European Green Deal for us, Carolyn, give us the
       context for that. KISSANE: Yes, so, again, this is another fantastic
       question. Yeah, the European Green Deal, it’s—this is—this is great.
       Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say that the European Green Deal
       now is—that the—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sort of said, hey,
       this is why the Green Deal is so important. This is why we really need
       to more quickly transition to renewable energy, because look what—look
       what happened when we were dependent on Russia for over 30 percent of
       our natural gas. And look, when Russia, you know, illegally invades
       Ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas, we are left very energy-insecure.
       It affects—it affects consumers. It affects industry across the
       continent. So, I think we’re seeing, not just through the Green Deal,
       but we’re also seeing through, sort of European green industrial
       policy—so in some ways, akin to what, you know, we put into effect
       in—this past summer, is the Inflation Reduction Act. And we’re seeing
       almost, kind of, this industrial competition around clean energy
       technologies. And so, Europe is investing—you know, I think it’s about
       $250 billion, the United States, it’s about 370 billion—towards
       the—kind of the energy transition, and helping to support domestic
       industries and companies to—you know, to be able to, you know, develop
       the technologies, and to have the, you know, the opportunity to
       contribute to the energy transition. So, I think one thing,
       though—whenever I talk about Europe, it’s really important, is to sort
       of recognize that, you know, when you look across Europe, you have
       very different policies and kind of approaches, to sort of thinking
       about energy, and how quickly some countries want to transition and
       can transition, whereas others, you know, are probably going to
       experience a slower transition. So, just really interesting example,
       as you talked about the Green Deal, is the EU taxonomy, the green
       taxonomy, that went into effect in the—January of 2022. And there, you
       had, like, really a lot of contention between France and Germany,
       because France wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green
       taxonomy. Germany was opposed, right, but Germany wanted to make sure
       natural gas was part of the green taxonomy. So ultimately, in the end,
       both natural gas and nuclear—and again, this was—this predated
       Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in the EU green taxonomy, you
       have—you know, you have both nuclear and natural gas, in addition to
       other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy, that includes
       specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate
       change. So you know, I think you’re seeing this kind of—some people
       call it a race, a competition. You know, ideally, it’s—you know, we’re
       kind of working together to—because we’re all sort of going in the
       same direction—to, you know, support the transition, and to reduce—to
       reduce carbon emissions, and to bring in more, sort of, cleaner energy
       technologies into our system. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take
       the next question from Dr. Laeed Zaghlami. Q: Yes, good afternoon.
       This is Laeed—good afternoon, Irina. Good afternoon, Carolyn. I’m very
       pleased to be part of your program. Just to—want to be back to Africa
       and particularly to Nigeria, how practical the two projects that
       Nigeria is advocating for pipelines, one from—through Algeria, and the
       other one to Morocco through western African countries? How practical
       are these pipelines to supply gas to Europe and parts of some African
       countries? FASKIANOS: And Dr. Zaghlami, you are at Algiers University,
       correct? Q: Indeed, Irina, yes. I am professor at University of
       Algiers, faculty of information and communication. FASKIANOS: Thank
       you. KISSANE: Dr. Laeed, can I—can I keep you on for just one second?
       Can I ask you, what is the—what is the status right now? Is it—it’s
       planned, under construction? Where is—what is the status of those two
       pipelines? My understanding is that it’s—they’re proposed, but— Q:
       Yes, well, actually in—practically, the pipeline between Algeria and
       Abuja, which means through Niger and so forth, is already in progress,
       whereas the other project, through thirteen western African countries,
       they are supposed to be implemented by 2047. But is it—is there any
       political game or something of strategic—(inaudible)—how practical,
       how logical, how efficiently will be for Nigeria to have two similar
       project(s)? KISSANE: Yeah, no, it’s—again, thank you for the question.
       You know, pipelines, again, that’s why I wanted to show
       the—(laughs)—kind of the map of pipelines, is because, you know, a lot
       of pipelines transverse, you know, multiple countries, right? And this
       is—this requires not just, you know, a lot of cooperation, but it
       requires technically. It also can be very complex to build—to build
       pipelines. And when you’re talking about something like, as you—as you
       point out, these are, you know, crossing many countries. You know, I
       think one of the—again, one of the issues is whether or not—since, you
       know, what already is under construction, I think you can, you know,
       with confidence, that one will be completed. Anything that’s not yet
       under construction—and again, the timeline, 2047, is way out there—a
       lot of—a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects
       will be moving forward, for various reasons, in terms of making sure
       that the investments are there. Someone I know that studies pipelines,
       he says, you know, until the steel is in the ground, you don’t have
       the pipeline, and so until you know that you’ve got that, you know,
       you’ve got all the OKs, and you feel that kind of security of being
       able to build it, and being able to provide the resources to supply it
       and to move it. I think Algeria has been a really interesting case
       that hasn’t gotten enough attention, in terms of Algerian gas, that
       has—that has helped support Europe. Over the last years, we’ve seen an
       increase in Algerian gas going into Europe. Again, a lot of attention
       on U.S. LNG and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into
       Europe, but also Algeria has been, you know, very important for
       helping to support European energy security, and make up for some of
       the losses of the—of the Russian gas. And I think we’ll see more
       attention on Algeria, and Algeria’s role as a—you know, as an
       important source of energy, especially, you know, gas, going
       into—going into Europe, moving forward. FASKIANOS: So, I’ll take the
       next written question from Vincent Brooks, who is at Harvard and
       Diamondback Energy board of directors: How do you view the purchasing
       of discounted Russian oil by India, in particular relative to the
       purchasing by China? How are they using the oil purchased? And are you
       seeing more internal usage or external profit-making sales in places
       like Africa? And what are the implications of all of this? KISSANE:
       Right, great. Great question. So, all of the above—(laughs)—in some
       ways, right? There is definitely sort of profits that are being made.
       You know, I was—I was talking about this last week with someone, and
       you know, if you sort of put your shoe—put yourself in the shoes of
       India, right, so, India is a—is a rapidly growing economy, 1.4
       billion. You know, if you had—if you have very high energy inflation
       and high oil prices, that’s going to have ripples effects across the
       Indian economy. And so, you know, when you have a kind of opportunity
       to buy, you know, pretty steep discounted oil, which, you know, they
       had been able to buy from Russia, you know, for purposes of national
       security, they’ve been buying the oil. And one of the things that’s
       very interesting about India is that, actually, India has been
       building out its refining capacity. So, a lot of that oil is both for
       domestic, and some of it is being sort of re-exported. But I think
       what we’ve seen is that they’re using that oil to also sort of enhance
       their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging, refining power
       in Asia. And we see that in some ways in China, too. So, China, even
       though oil demand was down in 2022, much of the oil that they were
       buying from Russia went into its strategic supplies, which, you know,
       they now have access to. And again, I think, you know, a big question
       is what we’re going to see moving forward around oil demand in China.
       Wood Mackenzie just published a really interesting piece, kind of very
       bullish, on the expectations for oil demand in China, so whether or
       not they’re going to continue to buy, you know, Russian oil—and again,
       sort of taking advantage of these lower prices, you know. And I
       think—I think one of the things that—it’s kind of an inconvenient
       truth, whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in Europe, so
       European trading houses were kind of the main—the main points of
       Russian oil trade. A lot of that has been moved out, so, you know,
       Russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions, and
       have set up—in some cases, they’ve set up trading houses. And some of
       those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that, you
       know, that they can sort of, again, bypass the compliance to the
       sanctions. And you have some—you have some Russian oil traders that
       are making a lot of money—(laughs)—selling discounted oil, and then
       reselling it. A really interesting case, a couple of months ago, was
       out of Malaysia. Malaysia announced—or, in the, you know—that they
       were—that 1.5 million barrels were produced and sold, but
       only—Malaysia doesn’t produce that much. So, those were Russian
       barrels that were sort of being sold under, sort of, the
       Malaysian—under the Malaysian barrel. So, again, I think China and
       India have, you know, have taken advantage. Some of this has, again—as
       I said, has been re-exported. And some of it, you know, has been
       re-exported through petroleum products, because China and India, you
       know, both are building and have refining capacity. FASKIANOS: Thank
       you. I’m going to take the next question from Bhakti Mirchandani at
       Columbia University: What global trajectory do you see for nuclear?
       The Russia-Ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity
       offline, and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of
       energy. And so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy?
       KISSANE: Bhakti, thank you. And I was just at Columbia earlier today
       for the Center for Global Energy Policy’s conference. Yeah, nuclear is
       very interesting, right? So when we’re thinking about, you know,
       decarbonizing our energy systems, you know, nuclear plays a very
       important role, because it’s zero-emitting. So in certain parts of the
       world—China being one, Saudi Arabia—you know, you have a lot of new
       nuclear build. You know, in other parts of the world, you have a lot
       of contention about nuclear. We saw that even in Germany, which have,
       you know, three remaining nuclear power plants. And even in the midst
       of massive energy crisis over the last year, there was still sort of
       pushback about, no, those nuclear power plants need to be shut down,
       whereas you would think, OK, in light of energy insecurity, let’s keep
       them open. So, you know, France is an interesting country. France had
       planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent. But this past
       year, they pivoted and they’ve said, no, we’re actually going to build
       out more nuclear, and we’re sort of—we’re totally scrapping that idea
       of reducing nuclear energy. And nuclear is very important for France’s
       electricity system. Sweden has also announced that they are going to
       build new nuclear, and they’re going to increase by, I think, almost
       50 percent. Again, part of this is their—to meet their targets of net
       zero. We also see Japan. Japan, you know, the Fukushima disaster
       really turned Japanese—the Japanese public off of nuclear. Very, very
       deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants. But this past
       year, even though there’s still safety concerns on the part of the
       public, the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and
       higher prices. So, nuclear being a domestic source of energy. So, I
       think when you look at, you know, net-zero pathways, I have not seen a
       net-zero pathway that does not include nuclear. So, here in the United
       States, the net-zero America project out of Princeton, very important
       place for nuclear. We just have a really hard time—(laughs)—building
       nuclear at cost, so it’s very expensive. Usually, it’s significant
       cost overruns. And of course, there is the—I think they have a really
       significant PR problem. People—there’s still a lot of concern about
       the safety of nuclear. So, I think to your point, it’s very, very
       important for decarbonizing energy systems, but you’re going to see, I
       think, very disjointed approaches. Some countries are going—are
       embracing nuclear, and other countries are sort of doubling down on
       their opposition, and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the
       energy system. FASKIANOS: We have so many questions, and we are just
       not going to get to them all. So, I’m going to take the next question
       from Christian Bonfili, who’s at Torcuato di Tella University in
       Argentina. So, do you think, Carolyn, that the landscape resulting
       from the Ukraine invasion by Russia, vis-à-vis securitization of gas
       and energy between Europe and Russia, could accelerate energy
       transition toward greener energy? KISSANE: Great question. I think in
       Europe, it is. And I think, you know, many analysts would agree
       that—the IEA, for example—you know, you had the, you know—how does
       Europe continue—you know, to enhance and achieve energy security
       without the dependence on Russia gas? And a lot of that is through
       renewable energy. You also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen,
       and the role that hydrogen will play. I think—I think Europe is being
       cautious, and so they are not saying that they are going to completely
       move away from gas, so as earlier questions, are they getting gas from
       Algeria, or are they getting gas from Norway? Are they getting more
       gas from the United States in the form of liquefied natural gas? And
       then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied
       natural gas from Russia. So, we’ve seen an increase in LNG from Russia
       going into Europe. That said, I think all in, you are seeing that, you
       know, countries across Europe are saying, OK, you know, how can we
       enhance our energy security? How do we build more sort of domestic
       energy sources? Solar, wind, we’re seeing, you know, more rapid
       deployment. You’ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and
       things like that, but I think—overall, I think the answer would be
       that it’s quickening the energy transition. FASKIANOS: So, I will take
       the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to
       close on. And just to give us your top three—what are the major
       challenges for the geopolitics of oil, as you look out over the next
       five- to ten-year horizon, that you would leave us with, to be looking
       for? KISSANE: OK. You know, so I think what we saw, right, tensions
       between Saudi Arabia and the United States. We also have a, you know,
       a hot war, cold war, depending on, you know, the term you want to use,
       between the United States and China, and lots of sort of questions as
       to what that’s going to look like. I think there’s—you know, I think
       there’s concern that, you know, we’re not reducing demands, but we’re
       seeing tightening supply. And so that’s going to have, you know, very
       significant impacts for economies, especially economies that are
       already very fragile, economically fragile, politically fragile. So
       that concerns me a lot, in terms of, you know, what happens when, you
       know, economies don’t have adequate access to energy to make sure that
       their industries, that their—that consumers, you know, are able—that
       the lights can stay on, and you can get—you know, if you’re dependent
       on cars, you’re depending on trucks, like, all these kinds of things
       are really, really critical. So, I think we have to be very cautious
       moving forward, that we don’t take more out of the system before we
       have adequately set up the system to be resilient, and to be able to
       sort of meet the energy security demands that are not—are not—they’re
       not decreasing. I think they are increasing and becoming even more
       complex. So, I think there’s a lot of concerns and a lot of
       uncertainty. And you know, this definitely is going to be an area to
       watch in the years ahead. FASKIANOS: Carolyn Kissane—Kissane, excuse
       me—thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion, for
       sharing your terrific insights with us, and to all of you for your

             The Israel-Hamas War: The Humanitarian Crisis in Gaza

   Calls for a cease-fire are rising worldwide as the war between Israel and
   Hamas further exacerbates the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

   On October 7, the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a massive
   surprise assault on southern Israel, the deadliest single attack on
   Israelis in history. Israel’s subsequent declaration of war against Hamas
   has further worsened an already dire situation in the Gaza Strip, where
   more than two million Palestinians live. As the violence escalates, some
   injured civilians and foreign nationals in Gaza have been able to leave
   the territory during short “humanitarian pauses,” but international
   appeals for a full cease-fire are persisting as the war’s death toll
   mounts.

   Gaza, a small territory of about 139 square miles (360 square kilometers),
   or roughly the size of the city of Detroit, was already experiencing a
   severe humanitarian crisis before the current hostilities broke out. As a
   result of a sixteen-year blockade by Israel, about 95 percent of the
   population cannot access clean water, while more than half of all Gazans
   depend on international assistance for basic services. Additionally, some
   80 percent of Gaza’s residents are considered refugees under international
   law, and Palestinians overall compose the largest stateless community in
   the world.

   Since Hamas’s attack, the situation in Gaza has become a “catastrophe,” UN
   Secretary-General António Guterres said. According to the Hamas-controlled
   Gaza health ministry, as of November 10, Israel’s retaliation has killed
   at least 11,070 people, two-thirds of them women and children, while some
   2,650 others have been reported missing. These figures could not be
   independently verified, but outside sources have also put the death
   numbers in the thousands. At least forty journalists and media workers
   have also been killed, as well as more than one hundred UN employees.
   Hamas’s assault killed around 1,200 Israelis, around 70 percent of them
   civilians.

   Israel has imposed a complete siege of the territory, cutting off
   electricity and water, and supplies of food and medicine are dwindling
   fast. Without fuel, meanwhile, Gaza’s only power station has gone dark.
   The lack of electricity has shut down desalination and waste-water
   treatment plants, further compromising access to safe drinking water.
   Israeli air strikes have destroyed neighborhoods, schools, and mosques,
   though the Israeli military has said that it is only targeting weapons
   storage centers and infrastructure used or occupied by Hamas militants.
   However, Israeli air strikes targeting residential buildings and medical
   facilities have resulted in numerous civilian casualties.

   By the second week of November, Gaza’s health system was reported to have
   collapsed, with hospitals running low on rationed fuel reserves and
   medical supplies. Northern Gaza’s two major hospitals have already greatly
   exceeded capacity, and hospitals in the south are also overflowing.
   Beginning in November, Israeli strikes have targeted al-Shifa Hospital,
   the largest and best-equipped hospital in Gaza. Israeli officials claim
   Hamas has a command center beneath the facility. Meanwhile, a dispute
   between Israel and health authorities in Gaza over a potential fuel
   delivery has delayed fuel from reaching the hospital, from which thousands
   of people have fled. Israel’s energy minister said on October 12 that
   electricity, fuel, and water would not be provided to Gaza until all
   hostages—totaling roughly 240 people—held by Hamas are freed.

    What are the refuge options for Palestinians in Gaza?

   On October 13, Israel ordered more than one million people living in
   northern Gaza to evacuate to the south within twenty-four hours, ahead of
   an expected ground invasion targeting Hamas. The United Nations called on
   Israel to rescind the order, saying it would be “impossible” to achieve
   without “devastating humanitarian consequences.” As of November 10, more
   than 1.6 million people, or over half of Gaza’s population, had been
   displaced.

   Gazans’ options for refuge are limited. Israel has closed its two border
   crossings with Gaza as part of its blockade. Egypt, which shares the Rafah
   border crossing with Gaza and already hosts more than 350,000 refugees and
   asylum seekers [PDF], is the only viable outlet left. Though the Egyptian
   government was initially reluctant to open the crossing, it has since done
   so to allow aid trucks carrying water, food, and medical supplies to enter
   Gaza. (However, UN officials say the daily quota for deliveries is only a
   fraction of what is required to meet Gaza’s urgent needs.) Some foreign
   nationals and injured civilians have also been allowed to flee Gaza via
   the border crossing, which has temporarily closed several times due to
   Israeli strikes.

   With food, fuel, and water supplies rapidly dwindling, the United States
   is working with the United Nations and other international aid
   organizations to create “safe zones” [PDF] within Gaza where civilians can
   receive urgent humanitarian aid.

    How are humanitarian aid organizations responding?

   In November, the United Nations launched an updated $481 million flash
   appeal to address the needs of people in Gaza and the West Bank. In Gaza,
   the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and UN Relief and Works Agency for
   Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) are helping to provide
   essential goods and services, such as medical supplies, fuel, and
   emergency assistance. Several other major organizations, including the
   International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement—which comprises the
   Palestine Red Crescent Society—and Doctors Without Borders, are also
   supplying humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict. As the
   fighting continues, international calls for humanitarian pauses have
   grown, including from countries in the European Union and the Group of
   Seven (G7), while members of the Arab League have pushed for a complete
   cease-fire.

   Stella Maris has denied her comments were antisemitic

   The newly-elected rector of St Andrews University is facing calls to
   apologise over an email accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza.

   Stella Maris said Palestinians had suffered "apartheid, siege, illegal
   occupation and collective punishment" during the Israel-Gaza war.

   Hundreds of students have demanded that she retract her remarks or resign
   just a month after taking up the role.

   St Andrews University said it was "dismayed" by the rector's comments.

   The row came as hundreds of people attended demonstrations in Scotland on
   Saturday calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.

   In Glasgow, people gathered at the Buchanan Street steps on Saturday
   holding signs and banners which said "ceasefire now".

   First Minister Humza Yousaf and Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar took
   part in the Scottish Trades Union Congress's (STUC) annual St Andrew's Day
   protest which saw marchers gather at Glasgow Green.

   Asked about the St Andrews rector's comments he said: "There are
   communities - Jewish communities, Muslim communities - who are feeling
   vulnerable and all of us have a responsibility to make sure we are
   simmering down any of those tensions as opposed to inflaming them.

   "We can do that while very passionately arguing that what's happening in
   Gaza is unacceptable."

   ceasefire

   In a message to students sent on Tuesday, Ms Maris described how a vigil
   at the university was held earlier this month "following weeks of
   genocidal attacks by the Israeli government against Gaza".

   She said: "We must continue to recognize and condemn acts that are
   internationally regarded as humanitarian and war crimes.

   "It is also crucial to acknowledge and denounce the actions by Hamas that
   qualify as war crimes, notably the taking of hostages and deliberately
   targeting civilians, which I have and continue to do."

Human rights

   The email also included a link to a website which carried a story
   headlined: "The evidence Israel killed its own citizens on Oct 7."

   The role of rector, elected by students, is to provide pastoral support
   and represent the student community at the university's governing body
   where the rector serves as president.

   Ms Maris has rejected accusations that the message to students was
   antisemitic and argued her use of the terms genocide and apartheid were
   "supported by numerous human rights organizations".

   She told BBC Scotland News she would not be resigning and insisted she had
   done the right thing.

   Ms Maris sad: "I have received a lot of backlash and it's quite
   disappointing.

   "I really tried to write a statement that would make everyone happy, but
   realised I wasn't being true to my beliefs.

   "I'm glad I did it and it was the right thing to do."

   The rector added: "I've had racist comments as a result and have been
   accused of antisemitism, which I reject.

   "I don't intend on retracting my statement or resigning.

   "I denounce antisemitism in the strongest form. Reject the weaponising of
   antisemitism."

   However, a large group of students at the university, which was founded in
   1413 and is one of the oldest in the UK, insisted Ms Maris's comments
   "will only bring division and hatred".

   They are now calling for her to apologise or step down.

   St Andrews UniversityImage source, Getty Images
   Image caption,
   Ms Maris was elected as rector of the 610-year-old university in October

   In a letter to the rector, they say: "We are concerned that your letter
   does not demonstrate equal care for Palestinian and Israeli lives.

   "What is truly unacceptable is that you do not care to mention, let alone
   demonstrate regard for, the two St Andrews students who were recently
   attacked because of their religion.

   "Moreover, your letter does not show any appreciation for how your
   inflammatory and unfounded accusations of 'genocide,' 'apartheid,' and
   'occupation' concerning the Jewish State will further embolden attacks and
   hatred against the Jewish students whom you were elected to care for.

   "It is unacceptable for the rector to be selective in their responsibility
   to represent all students."

Free speech

   Ms Maris is a former English and philosophy graduate at the university and
   has since filled a series of student representation roles.

   She was elected rector on 10 October.

   Responding to Ms Maris's remarks, St Andrews University principal and
   vice-chancellor, Prof Dame Sally Mapstone, said the university was
   committed to free speech but that there was "no place for antisemitism,
   Islamophobia, or racism of any kind".

   She added: "We are utterly dismayed that the rector, on this occasion, put
   her right to freedom of expression ahead of her duty to represent all
   students, and to be concerned for their welfare.

   "We know that while some may have welcomed the message, others have been
   deeply offended and concerned by it.

   "While every one of us shares a desire for peace and an end to hostilities
   in Israel and Gaza, we regret that her message, the language it used, and
   some of the sources it cited have caused alarm, division, and harm in our
   community, and more widely."

Temporary truce

   The temporary truce is still holding and follows weeks of fighting and
   Israeli bombardments of Gaza, with the conflict sparked by Hamas's
   unprecedented cross-border attack in southern Israel that saw 1,200 people
   killed.

   Hamas earlier announced a delay in the release of further Israeli
   hostages, claiming Israel had broken the terms of the truce deal over aid
   deliveries to northern Gaza. Israel denied this, and the releases were due
   to resume following mediation.

   On the first day of the four-day ceasefire on Friday, Hamas released 24 of
   the about 240 hostages taken during its attack on Israel and Israel freed
   39 Palestinians from prison.

   The Israeli offensive has killed more than 14,500 Palestinians, according
   to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza government.

   Intellectuals clash over country’s traditional commitment to defence of
   Israel amid bloodshed in Gaza

     * Israel-Hamas war – live updates

    Philip Oltermann European culture editor
    @philipoltermann

   Wed 22 Nov 2023 17.02 CETLast modified on Thu 23 Nov 2023 16.08 CET
     * * * The phrase “Never again” has been the central tenet of Germany’s
   political identity since the horrors of the Nazi-led Holocaust of Europe’s
   Jewish population. But the war between Israel and Hamas has opened up a
   fiercely fought debate about the phrase’s true meaning, dividing opinion
   among followers of the dominant German intellectual tradition.

   A letter published in the Guardian pits several prominent German and
   international figures influenced by the Frankfurt School of neo-Marxist
   “critical theory” against its most prominent living member, Jürgen
   Habermas. They argue that “Never again” must also mean staying alert to
   the possibility that what is unfolding in Gaza could amount to genocide.

   In a statement published on 13 November, Habermas made the case that the
   “Never again” principle must above all lead to a German commitment to
   protecting Jewish life and Israel’s right to exist.

   Habermas, 94, sometimes described as a contemporary successor to the
   Enlightenment philosophers for his writing on themes of power and justice,
   argued that Israel’s military retaliation following the 7 October Hamas
   attacks was “justified in principle”. Likening the resulting bloodshed in
   Gaza to a genocide was beyond the boundaries of acceptable debate, he
   said.

   “Despite all the concern for the fate of the Palestinian population […],
   the standards of judgment slip completely when genocidal intentions are
   attributed to Israel’s actions,” said the statement, which was also signed
   by the political scientist Rainer Forst, the lawyer Klaus Günther and the
   peace researcher Nicole Deitelhoff.

   In response, the letter published on Wednesday echoes Habermas’s
   condemnation of the Hamas attack and hostage-taking, but expresses concern
   over the “apparent limits of the solidarity expressed” by the philosopher
   and his co-authors.

   “The statement’s concern for human dignity is not adequately extended to
   Palestinian civilians in Gaza who are facing death and destruction,” it
   adds. “Nor is it applied or extended to Muslims in Germany experiencing
   rising Islamophobia. Solidarity means that the principle of human dignity
   must apply to all people. This requires us to recognise and address the
   suffering of all those affected by an armed conflict.”

   The letter continues: “We are concerned that there is no mention of
   upholding international law, which also prohibits war crimes and crimes
   against humanity such as collective punishment, persecution, and the
   destruction of civilian infrastructure including schools, hospitals and
   places of worship.”

   While “not all signatories believe that the legal standards for genocide
   have been met” by the situation in Gaza, the letter says, all of them
   “agree this is a matter of legitimate debate”.

   On Sunday, a group of UN experts said there was “evidence of increasing
   genocidal incitement” against the Palestinian people. Israeli officials
   reject this.

   The letter’s full list of more than 100 supporters includes several
   academics who have either directly emerged from the Frankfurt School or
   are employed at New York’s New School for Social Research, which sees
   itself working within the same critical theory tradition.

   Other signatories include the economist Adam Tooze, the legal historian
   Samuel Moyn, and the philosophers Amia Srinivasan and Nancy Fraser.

   More than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed by Hamas militants
   on 7 October. Since Israel’s counter-offensive was launched , more than
   14,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to Hamas-run health
   authorities.

   On Wednesday, Israel and Hamas agreed a deal for the release of 50 women
   and children hostages held in Gaza in return for 150 Palestinian women and
   children to be freed from Israeli jails during a four-day ceasefire.

   Founded in 1923, the Frankfurt School applied Marxist theory to philosophy
   and social theory to make sense of the rise of fascism out of apparently
   liberal European societies. Habermas, a former assistant to Theodor
   Adorno, took a more optimistic stance than the institution’s founding
   members, seeking to build an intellectual framework for democratic
   societies operating within market capitalism.

   Habermas’s letter reflects a strong, cross-party pro-Israel consensus in
   German politics. The to-and-fro of statements comes on the back of a
   motion for a resolution put forward on 7 November by the three centre-left
   and liberal parties of Olaf Scholz’s coalition government, which proposes
   allowing the extradition of non-German citizenship holders who spread
   hatred against Jews, as well as withdrawing funding from cultural
   institutions that support the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS)
   movement.

   Critics fear such a resolution would also result in the silencing of
   legitimate criticism of Israeli policies. In Berlin, the city senate is
   considering pulling funding for the Oyoun cultural centre in the German
   capital’s Neukölln district, after the centre’s directors reportedly
   refused to cancel a peace vigil by a leftwing Jewish group.

   WASHINGTON (AP) — The negotiations hardly ran smoothly. But in the end,
   persistence paid off.

   Six weeks ago, not long after Hamas killed more than 1,200 people in
   Israel and took scores of others hostage in a surprise assault, the
   government of Qatar quietly reached out to the United States to discuss
   how to secure the release of those who were taken captive by the militant
   group.

   But the mission demanded extreme sensitivity. It was so secret that U.S.
   officials established a communications cell to reach Hamas directly and
   kept those negotiations tightly guarded throughout the U.S. government.
   Only a handful of people were aware of the talks, according to a senior
   White House official.

   The cell allowed the small circle of negotiators to speak regularly
   without additional bureaucracy. U.S. and Israeli officials spent weeks
   scrambling to put together a deal that would free dozens of hostages held
   by Hamas. The White House saw that as the only realistic way to halt the
   bloody combat that has devastated the region for more than six weeks.

   What does the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas look like?

   The U.S. continuously pushed Hamas, with Qatar and Egypt acting as
   critical intermediaries. All the while, President Joe Biden and other
   senior U.S. officials assured distraught family members of hostages
   through emotional Zooms and in-person meetings that they were doing
   everything they could to secure their loved ones’ release.

   The U.S. president was still working on the hostage deal as late as
   Wednesday in phone calls with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
   and other world leaders, stressing the importance of moving from agreement
   to actual releases. Biden vowed that he would not relent until all
   American hostages in Gaza were released.

   And there was a final hiccup in the agreement both sides apparently had
   reached. Talks continued, and no hostages were to be released before
   Friday.

   Biden said the White House had been working tirelessly to secure the
   release of hostages since the “earliest moments of Hamas’s brutal
   assault.”

   This account of how the hostage deal came together was described by the
   senior White House official and two Egyptian officials who were granted
   anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations, as well as accounts in
   Israeli media.

   The cell to communicate with Hamas was established by Brett McGurk, the
   National Security Council’s coordinator for the Middle East, and Joshua
   Geltzer, legal adviser to the National Security Council. McGurk would
   speak every morning with Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, the
   Qatari prime minister, while Jake Sullivan, the White House national
   security adviser, communicated daily with his Israeli counterparts, with
   Biden being briefed throughout. Also critical was CIA Director Bill Burns,
   who had been talking with David Barnea, the director of Mossad, the
   Israeli intelligence agency.

   The final deal that emerged this week — during a four-day cease-fire,
   Hamas would release 50 hostages in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners
   held by Israel — was an agreement that evolved through the weeks of
   negotiations.

   One of the earliest proposals was put forward on Oct. 12, five days after
   the initial Hamas attack, and it called for releasing all women and
   children held by Hamas and other Palestinian militants in Gaza, in return
   for freeing all Palestinian women in Israeli prisons, according to the
   Egyptian officials.

   The Israelis rejected that initial proposal, but it “opened the door for
   more talks,” one of the Egyptian officials said.

   In repeated conversations in late October between Biden and Netanyahu, the
   Israeli prime minister underscored his red line: The attacks on Gaza would
   cease only if there was a hostage release. Biden had his own demand
   throughout the talks: Humanitarian assistance had to reach Gaza,
   regardless of a deal.

   Eventually, the first two U.S. hostages held by Hamas – Natalie and Judith
   Raanan – were released. As senior national security officials tracked
   their release out of Gaza and Biden personally phoned Natalie’s father to
   tell him of the news, the White House became more confident that the
   secret cell set up to talk with Hamas would work, and intensified efforts
   to rescue more hostages.

   Shortly after the Raanans’ release — and just before a long-anticipated
   Israeli ground invasion into Gaza — the U.S. was informed that Hamas had
   signed off on the contours of a deal that would halt the offensive
   temporarily while the women and children were released.

   But there were multiple issues, from Israel’s view: Hamas had offered no
   proof of life of any of the hostages, nor would it say who precisely was
   being held until the fighting ceased. That, for Israel, wouldn’t be enough
   to stop the ground invasion. The U.S., too, was skeptical.

   Meanwhile, Hamas’ political leaders in Beirut, Doha and Cairo accused
   Israel of stalling the talks.

   Hamas political bureau member Basem Naim told journalists in Beirut on
   Nov. 10 that the group was prepared to release the civilian hostages if
   there were guarantees of “safe movement so that we can collect information
   and data to implement this step.” He complained that Israel was not
   responsive.

   Still, the negotiations continued.

   Israel’s ground invasion plans were revised so fighting could be paused if
   a hostage deal came together. The talks — with messages being routed
   through Doha or Cairo into Gaza — veered into highly technical details,
   and proposals flew back and forth. The U.S. repeatedly pushed Hamas, with
   Doha as the intermediary, to provide identifying information for the women
   and children being held. The militant group continued to refuse.

   By Nov. 12, Biden had had enough.

   He called Qatar’s ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and
   demanded specifics from Hamas. For any agreement to go through, Biden
   insisted, the U.S. needed clear identifications for the estimated 50
   hostages who would be freed — ages, gender, where they were from.
   Otherwise, the deal would not go through.

   Shortly after that call, Hamas produced the information the U.S. had
   sought. Biden called Netanyahu on Nov. 14 and urged the prime minister to
   take the deal. Netanyahu agreed to move forward. In meetings with McGurk,
   Netanyahu urged the U.S. to press the Qataris to nail down the final
   terms.

   During this time, the mediators had been swapping more workable drafts of
   a hostage agreement. One version outlined a five-day cease-fire and the
   release of somewhere between 200 to 300 Palestinian women and children.
   Israel had insisted on a two-day cease-fire and the release of about 100
   non-Hamas Palestinians.

   But Hamas then went dark. The militant group stopped talking with the
   Qataris and Egyptians, threatening to walk from the talks after the
   Israeli Defense Forces entered Shifa Hospital, the largest and
   best-equipped medical center in Gaza that Israel insists is being used by
   Hamas for military purposes.

   “Everything was to fall apart at this stage,” one of the Egyptian
   officials said. “Hamas was angry. We all were angry.”

   For three days, Egypt, Qatar and the U.S. pressured the warring sides to
   reach a compromise: Four-day cease-fire, and three Palestinian prisoners
   for each hostage. Egypt also insisted on easing Israeli restrictions on
   the flow of humanitarian aid. Talks resumed last Friday, and in another
   conversation with the Qatari emir, Biden told him it was the last shot at
   a hostage deal and he had to close it now.

   McGurk spent the next several days after that call between Biden and Al
   Thani hammering out the finer points of the hostage agreement. Officials
   also crafted a way to try to entice Hamas to release more hostages than
   the 50 already agreed to. The universe of unresolved issues continued to
   narrow until Tuesday morning, Nov. 21, when Hamas told Qatari officials
   they were on board.

   On Wednesday, Israel’s war cabinet signed off.

   “In recent days, I have spoken with our friend, US President Joe Biden and
   I requested his intervention in order to improve the outline that will be
   presented to you,” Netanyahu said as his war cabinet convened. “Indeed, it
   has been improved to include more hostages and at a lower cost. These
   talks have been productive. President Biden joined in the effort and I
   thank him for it.”

    * Protesters from across Ontario travel to Ottawa for largest pro-Palestine
                                   rally yet

   Thousands of people gathered on Parliament Hill in Ottawa Saturday for a
   rally calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza on the second-day of a
   four-day pause in the fighting.

   There have been protests in Ottawa every week since the Oct. 7 Hamas
   attack, which have grown in size and scope.

     * Complete coverage of the Israel-Hamas war

   Several groups, including the Palestinian Youth Movement and Jews Say No
   to Genocide, and their supporters gathered in Ottawa Saturday afternoon.

   The Palestinian Youth Movement said on social media it is demanding "an
   end to Canadian complicity in the ongoing genocide in Gaza and
   colonization of Palestine" and to demand that the government call for a
   permanent ceasefire in the region. It is also demanding Canada cease
   selling weapons to Israel.

   "We call on Palestinians, Arabs, and people of conscience from all across
   Canada to make plans to travel to Ottawa on this day for what is sure to
   be a historic march: together, a people's chorus becomes impossible for
   the Canadian government to ignore," the group said.

   "We are here to call for a genuine ceasefire. Not a pause but a genuine
   ceasefire," said the Palestinian Youth Movement's Yara Shoufani. "We are
   here today in a historic march in support of the Palestinian people."

   The Jews Say No to Genocide group said in a news release on Friday that it
   is also calling for a permanent ceasefire, a halt to all military aid and
   arms sales to Israel and for the government to demand an end to the
   occupation of Gaza and the West Bank.

   "The continued escalation we are witnessing of the Israeli
   state-sanctioned brutality, human rights violations and crimes against
   humanity across Gaza and the West Bank must end now," the group said.

   "Canadian Jews add their voices to this global chorus calling for justice
   for the Palestinian people. As Jews, we cannot and will not stand idly by
   as the State of Israel - with the full support of the Canadian government
   - continues to commit atrocities day-in, day-out that go against the very
   core of our faith."

   According to federal government figures, Canada exported more than $21
   million worth of military goods and technology to Israel in 2022.

   Organizers say people were bussed in to Ottawa from across Ontario,
   including Toronto, Mississauga, and Kitchener-Waterloo.

   Among the crowd was Ontario MPP Sara Jama, who was ejected from the
   provincial NDP caucus over a social media post two days after the Oct. 7
   attack in which she expressed support for the Palestinian people and
   called for an end to the "occupation of Palestinian land." She was
   criticized for not mentioning Hamas or the attack. She later apologized
   and condemned Hamas, but the Progressive Conservative government censured
   her in the legislature.

   "I'm here today in support of the many Palestinians that are organizing to
   continue to put pressure on this government for a ceasefire," Jama said
   Saturday. "We know that a four-day pause is not enough."

   Ottawa Centre NDP MPP Joel Harden was also at the rally. 

   "Release all hostages. End the seige, end the occupation. It’s time for
   peace with justice," he wrote on X.

   Also in attendance was Dr. Tarek Loubani, from London, Ont., who is facing
   a mischief charge after an MP's office was vandalized with ketchup
   following a demonstration in October. Loubani expressed concern about the
   lack of medical supplies in Gaza.

   "They don't have the basic composites of medical care, like water, soap,
   anesthetic," he said. "With these things absent, they aren't able to do
   their job appropriately."

   Loubani made international headlines when he was detained in Egypt while
   on his way to Gaza for a medical mission in 2013.

   In 2018, he was shot in the legs while helping wounded protesters in Gaza.

   After leaving Parliament Hill, demonstrators marched through downtown
   Ottawa streets.

   A four-day ceasefire in Gaza began Friday as part of an agreement brokered
   by Qatar, to free hostages and prisoners. Twenty-four Hamas hostages were
   freed Friday, including 13 Israeli citizens, 10 Thai nationals and one
   Filipino person. Israel released 39 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli Prime
   Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the war effort will continue after
   the ceasefire expires.

   Over the four days, Hamas is supposed to release at least 50 Israeli
   hostages, and Israel will free 150 Palestinian prisoners, all of them
   women and children.

   The continued release of hostages from Gaza was delayed Saturday when
   Hamas alleged Israel violated the terms of the truce; however, it was
   later agreed that Hamas would release 13 Israelis and seven other foreign
   nationals in exchange for 39 Palestinians. 

   Since the war began, around 1,200 people in Israel have been killed,
   largely from Hamas's incursion on Oct. 7, while more than 13,000
   Palestinians have been killed, according the Ministry of Health in
   Hamas-controlled Gaza, most often because of Israeli airstrikes in
   retaliation for the Hamas attack.

       International Red Cross concludes release of 17 Gaza-held hostages

   The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Saturday it
   had concluded the release of 17 hostages held in Gaza.

   "Our teams have transported these 17 people from within Gaza to the Rafah
   border, where they were handed over to Israeli authorities," an ICRC
   spokesperson said in an email to Reuters. The ICRC team consisted of eight
   staff members, including a doctor, traveling in four vehicles, he said.

   The neutral, Swiss-based organization already facilitated the release and
   transfer of Gaza-held hostages and Palestinian detainees on Friday under
   the terms of a four-day truce.

   The Gaza hostage deal was back on track after a temporary delay over a
   dispute about aid supplies to the north of the besieged enclave.

   "13 Israelis and 4 foreigners were received by ICRC and on their way to
   Rafah," Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman, Majed Al Ansari, said on
   social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.

   TV images showed Red Cross vehicles at Rafah crossing between Gaza and
   Egypt.

   A Palestinian official familiar with the diplomacy said Hamas would
   continue with the four-day truce agreed with Israel, the first break in
   fighting in seven weeks of war.

   Al Ansari earlier said a brief delay and obstacle to the hostage release
   were overcome through Qatari-Egyptian contacts with both sides, adding
   that 39 Palestinian civilians were going to be released in exchange.

   Among the Israeli hostages, eight were expected to be children and five
   others women, Al Ansari said, while the Palestinians to be released from
   Israeli prisons would consist of 33 children and six women.

   U.S. President Joe Biden spoke to Qatar Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al
   Thani on the hold-up over the hostage deal, Adrienne Watson, spokesperson
   for the White House National Security Council, said. About 3-1/2 hours
   after their call, the White House learned from the Qataris that the
   agreement was back on and the International Committee of the Red Cross
   (ICRC) was moving to collect the hostages, Watson added.

   The armed wing of Hamas had earlier said it was delaying Saturday's
   scheduled second round of hostage releases until Israel met all truce
   conditions, including committing to let aid trucks into northern Gaza.

   Hamas spokesperson Osama Hamdan said only 65 of 340 aid trucks that had
   entered Gaza since Friday had reached northern Gaza, which was "less than
   half of what Israel agreed on."

   Al-Qassam Brigades also said Israel had failed to respect the terms of the
   Palestinian prisoner releases. Qadura Fares, the Palestinian commissioner
   for prisoners, said Israel had not released detainees by seniority, as was
   expected.

   Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter, a member of Israel's security cabinet,
   told Channel 13 News that Israel was "abiding by the deal" with Hamas that
   Qatar had mediated.

   Center in Petah Tikva, Israel, November 24, 2023.

   Israel has said 50 trucks with food, water, shelter equipment and medical
   supplies had deployed to northern Gaza under UN supervision, the first
   significant aid delivery there since the start of the war.

   The brief dispute over the truce raised concerns over the smooth
   implementation of the hostage deal after 13 Israeli women and children
   were freed by Hamas on Friday. Some 39 Palestinian women and teenagers
   were released from Israeli jails.

   Israeli army spokesperson Olivier Rafowicz told French television Israel
   was strictly honoring the terms of the truce, and said the military had
   carried out no attacks or offensive operations in Gaza on Saturday.

Truce extended?

   A total of 50 hostages are to be exchanged for 150 Palestinian prisoners
   over four days under the truce, the first halt in fighting since Hamas
   fighters rampaged through southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people
   and taking about 240 hostages.

   In response to that attack, Israel has vowed to destroy the Hamas
   militants who run Gaza, raining bombs and shells on the enclave and
   launching a ground offensive in the north. To date, some 14,800 people,
   roughly 40% of them children, have been killed, Palestinian health
   authorities said on Saturday.

   Before the delay to the latest hostage and prisoner exchange, Egypt, which
   controls the Rafah border crossing through which aid supplies have resumed
   into southern Gaza, said it had received "positive signals" from all
   parties over a possible truce extension.

   Israel has said the ceasefire could be extended if Hamas continues to
   release hostages at a rate of at least 10 per day. A Palestinian source
   has said up to 100 hostages could go free.

Dancing for joy

   The short-lived row over the truce accord's implementation contrasted with
   scenes of joy earlier in the day as hostages were reunited with their
   families.

   After almost 50 days in captivity in Gaza, nine-year-old Ohad Munder ran
   down a hospital corridor in Israel into his father's arms, footage
   released by the hospital showed.

   He and three other children released at the same time were in relatively
   good condition, Gilat Livni, the center's Director of Paediatrics told
   reporters.

   "They shared experiences, we were up with them until late at night and it
   was interesting, upsetting and moving," said Livni.

   "I dreamt we came home," said another hostage, four-year-old Raz Asher, as
   she sat in her father's arms on a hospital bed after she and her mother
   and younger sister were freed. "Now the dream came true," her father,
   Yoni, replied.

   For Palestinians, however, joy at the release of prisoners from Israeli
   jails had a bitter tinge to it. Israeli police were seen raiding the home
   of Sawsan Bkeer on Friday shortly before her daughter Marah, 24, was
   released. Israeli police declined to comment.

   "There is no real joy, even this little joy we feel as we wait," said
   Sawsan Bkeer. "We are still afraid to feel happy," she said.

   In a barbaric surprise attack launched by Hamas on October 7, more Jews
   were slaughtered than on any day since the Holocaust. Thousands of elite
   Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip infiltrated small communities and
   cities in southern Israel, where they proceeded to commit sadistic,
   repulsive crimes against humanity, filming their vile deeds and boasting
   about them to friends and family back home.

   The assault was devastating for the Israeli people. Around 1,200 people
   were killed that day (the equivalent of around 42,500 Americans, adjusting
   for population) and some 240 were kidnapped—including young children and
   elderly people—and taken into Hamas’s vast tunnel network beneath Gaza.

   It was also devastating for the Israeli state. On that fateful day, the
   country’s long-standing security doctrine crumbled in the face of a
   perfect storm; as a consequence, its intelligence and military
   institutions were unable to keep citizens safe. For years, the country’s
   political and military establishment had allowed intolerable threats to
   gather by seeking to maintain the status quo in the conflict with the
   Palestinians and to establish a modus vivendi with the de facto Hamas
   state in Gaza based on deterrence, aiming to extend periods of
   tranquility.

   Israel cannot return to the status quo that existed before October 7. The
   state’s task now is to bring all the hostages back home and to make it
   impossible for Hamas and other adversaries, notably the Iranian-backed
   Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, to carry out further terrorist attacks
   against Israeli citizens or pose direct threats to their security.
   Simultaneously, the government and the political establishment must accept
   responsibility for their strategic errors. They should prioritize national
   security interests above political survival and work to foster unity among
   Israelis, preparing them for the demanding times and challenges that lie
   ahead. And once the danger posed by Hamas has been eliminated, Israel must
   renew the process of promoting stable security and political arrangements
   with the Palestinians.

   A necessary paradigm shift is now underway. But a paradigm can shift in
   many different directions. For the sake of Israel’s future, this one must
   push the country’s defense institutions and security strategy back toward
   certain basic principles from which they have strayed in recent years.

  KNOW YOUR ENEMY

   Israel’s national security doctrine was initially crafted in the
   mid-twentieth century under the country’s first prime minister, David
   Ben-Gurion. Over the decades, it has been updated to include four main
   pillars: deterrence, early warning, defense, and decisive victory.

   Deterrence is an intricate art. Its waning can be discerned in real time,
   yet its definitive breakdown becomes evident only in retrospect. In this
   case, there were plenty of reasons why Hamas ceased to be deterred and
   concluded the time was right to attack. Because of Israel’s overreliance
   on deterrence, and its tacit acceptance of a prolonged buildup of Hamas
   forces in Gaza (facilitated by Iranian funding and expertise), the group
   had achieved an unusually high level of operational readiness to carry out
   a major attack. It had also identified significant vulnerabilities in
   Israel’s defenses around Gaza. Hamas may have calculated there was a good
   chance that a major assault and the likely Israeli response might spark
   violence on other fronts, including inside Israel—as was the case with an
   escalation of the fighting in Gaza in May 2021 that provoked clashes among
   Arabs and Jews in cities across Israel.

   Meanwhile, the progress of talks intended to produce the normalization of
   relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia heightened the concerns of both
   Hamas and Iran, which fear the further consolidation of a bloc opposed to
   the Islamic Republic and its allies and proxies—the so-called axis of
   resistance—and worry about Israel’s deeper integration into the region.
   Hamas presumably believed a major attack would thwart this process.

     Deterrence’s waning can be discerned in real time, yet its breakdown
     becomes evident only in retrospect.

   Hamas was likely encouraged by the impression that Israel’s internal
   political crisis—sparked by extensive protests against Prime Minister
   Benjamin Netanyahu’s proposal to curtail the power of the Israeli Supreme
   Court—had diverted attention from Gaza and significantly undermined
   Israel’s social cohesion and steadfastness. It is worth noting that
   officials with Israel’s Military Intelligence Directorate, the chief of
   staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), and the minister of defense had
   all cautioned Netanyahu about Israel appearing historically weak in the
   eyes of its adversaries. Despite these warnings conveyed in recent months
   through a series of letters, Netanyahu chose to disregard them.

   According to Israel’s security doctrine, when deterrence fails, the
   intelligence community assumes the vital role of providing early warning,
   enabling the IDF to prepare and respond effectively to the threat. But a
   catastrophic misconception had taken hold within the Israeli intelligence
   community in recent years, just as happened in the run-up to the Yom
   Kippur War in 1973. During that time, the intelligence community wrongly
   assessed that Egypt and Syria would not dare to engage in a war they could
   not win, failing to comprehend Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat’s goal of
   breaking the status quo.

   As a jihadi terror organization aligned with Iran and its axis of
   resistance, Hamas’s fundamental aspiration is to inflict harm on Israel
   and undermine the state, with the ultimate aim of obliterating it. But
   Israeli intelligence and decision-makers had come to believe that Hamas’s
   responsibilities in Gaza—where it essentially governed a de facto state of
   over two million Palestinians—had tempered its extremism. Hamas
   deceitfully encouraged this misperception in recent years, posing as a
   reliable actor and warning of escalation if Israel did not allow funding
   from Qatar to arrive in Gaza and did not permit more Gazan workers in
   Israel. When Israel agreed to those concessions, Hamas used the resulting
   money and the information gathered from Gazans allowed to work in Israel
   to clandestinely plot its murderous offensive.

   This failure to properly comprehend Hamas’s nature and its intentions
   dates back to the 2005 Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the subsequent
   Hamas coup against the Palestinian Authority there. Since then, Israel had
   operated on the premise that a deterred and weakened Hamas was preferable
   to a governance vacuum in Gaza and would allow Israel to focus on what it
   perceived as more critical strategic challenges, such as Iran’s nuclear
   aspirations and Hezbollah’s military buildup. Accordingly, each time a
   flare-up occurred in Gaza, Israel’s aim was to reestablish deterrence
   through a limited use of force. This allowed Hamas to carry out a
   long-term buildup of arms and military infrastructure and to improve its
   operational capabilities.

   When deterrence falters and early warnings fail to materialize, Israel’s
   traditional security doctrine falls back on its third pillar: the IDF’s
   defensive capabilities. In the past decade, the IDF has succeeded in
   mitigating two central threats from Gaza: rocket attacks (which Israel’s
   Iron Dome defense system intercepts) and tunnels infiltrating Israeli
   territory (which were neutralized by an underground antitunnel barrier
   that Israel completed along the border with Gaza in 2021). But Israel
   failed to imagine an aboveground invasion and did not reinforce defenses
   around Gaza in proportion to Hamas’s growing military capabilities,
   deviating from a key lesson learned during the Yom Kippur War: organize
   defense according to an adversary’s capabilities and not only to its
   assessed intentions. Consequently, Israeli forces in the area were
   outnumbered and caught off guard after the IDF reduced its troop presence
   around Gaza and granted leave to many soldiers during the Sukkot holiday.

   The IDF had also become overly reliant on technological means of defending
   the border, such as cameras, advanced sensors, and remotely operated
   machine guns. Hamas used drones to neutralize those tools and breached the
   barrier with bulldozers: a combination of high-tech and low-tech means
   unlike anything Israel had anticipated.

   The fourth pillar of Israel’s security doctrine is the concept of
   achieving a decisive military outcome—that is, securing an uncontested
   victory over the enemy by neutralizing both its military capabilities and
   its resolve to continue fighting. This idea has sparked extensive debate
   among experts and senior IDF leaders for many years about how to define
   “decisive outcome” and “victory” and how to apply them to conflicts with
   nonstate actors and terrorist groups. Israel now understands that although
   the jihadi ideology of Hamas may persist (as have those of the Islamic
   State, or ISIS, and al Qaeda), the IDF must dismantle the organization’s
   military capabilities.

  THE GOAL IN GAZA

   In the wake of Hamas’s brutal attack, Israel has come to see that it
   cannot coexist with a jihadi Islamist state akin to ISIS at its doorstep
   in Gaza. The era of intermittent cycles of fighting and cease-fires in
   Gaza is over. What will replace it is a continuous, protracted military
   campaign, one driven not by a desire for revenge but grounded in Israel’s
   paramount security interests and an unwavering commitment to the safe
   return of the hostages being held by Hamas.

   Israel’s ground operation was only the first step, and the military effort
   will persist after the withdrawal of IDF forces from Gaza. An effective
   Israeli strategy demands the integration of several interrelated, parallel
   endeavors—military, civilian, and political—executed methodically within a
   structured framework, which must be continually realigned with the
   expectations of the Israeli public and combined with a diplomatic campaign
   that will secure the assistance and support that the country will need
   from allies and partners.

   This war marks a return to the conditions outlined in the Oslo accords,
   which underscored Israel’s unwillingness to tolerate an armed Palestinian
   entity on its borders. The Israeli government is also seeking to restore
   the public’s trust in the IDF and other state institutions and send a
   signal that harming Israeli citizens will yield an unbearable cost for the
   country’s adversaries and lead to their eventual destruction. The extent
   of the damage inflicted by Hamas on Israel demands a decisive response,
   even if it entails significant sacrifices. The people of Israel, rallying
   for reserve duty in unprecedented numbers and orchestrating volunteer
   organizations to aid survivors and displaced people, are acutely aware of
   the formidable challenge ahead and are willing to bear the necessary
   burdens and costs.

     Israel believed that Hamas’s responsibilities in Gaza had tempered its
     extremism.

   The realistic objectives of the current ground phase of the war are not to
   eliminate every Hamas operative or completely demilitarize Gaza but to
   degrade Hamas (and its sometime ally, Palestinian Islamic Jihad) as a
   fighting force, destroy its infrastructure, and eliminate the direct
   threat it poses to Israeli communities near Gaza. This will require the
   destruction of Hamas’s nerve center in Gaza City, its underground
   facilities, and all its aboveground assets, such as military
   installations, headquarters, command-and-control centers, communications
   infrastructure, weapons manufacturing facilities, and arms depots.

   In selecting targets to bomb or raid, the IDF painstakingly attempts to
   distinguish Hamas operatives and infrastructure from the noncombatant
   civilian population in accordance with the laws of war. This task is
   complicated by the intense density of Gaza’s population within which Hamas
   deliberately operates and entrenches its military infrastructure and by
   the network of approximately 300 miles of tunnels that Hamas has built
   during the past 15 years, subterranean fortifications that stretch beneath
   every city in Gaza, often under critical civilian structures such as
   hospitals and schools.

   To contend with the dilemma this poses, the IDF has consistently urged
   Gazans to evacuate the main operational zone in the northern part of Gaza
   and move south through secure corridors the IDF has established.
   Furthermore, the IDF refrains from striking Hamas military targets in
   which many civilians reside, allowing them to evacuate. Despite these
   precautions, the war has nevertheless produced a significant number of
   civilian casualties, frequently as a result of Hamas’s tactic of using
   civilians as human shields. Hamas obstructs the evacuation of civilians
   from operational areas and sites, and it has even targeted the secure
   crossings established by the IDF with mortars, intentionally impeding
   civilians from relocating to the southern Gaza Strip. In the face of such
   tactics, the IDF has gone to extraordinary lengths to prevent civilian
   causalities, exceeding the precautions taken by the militaries of most
   other democratic countries. As the war progresses, the IDF must maintain
   those standards, consistently communicate and demonstrate its commitment
   to adhere to the laws of war, and acknowledge any lapses on its own part.

   To alleviate human suffering and to maintain the legitimacy of its
   military effort, Israel has permitted the entry of humanitarian aid into
   Gaza through Egypt. This excludes supplies that would directly aid Hamas’s
   war effort, however, such as fuel beyond the amount required for
   operations that meet humanitarian needs such as hospitals, bakeries, water
   desalination, and sewage pumping. It was, after all, the influx of goods
   and energy that Israel allowed into Gaza in recent years that enabled
   Hamas to build the terrorist army that attacked Israeli territory on
   October 7.

   The ground operation will end only when Hamas ceases to function as a
   governing authority in Gaza and its military capabilities are
   significantly degraded. At that point, the campaign will transition to a
   new phase, likely spanning several years, at least until all the hostages
   have been released and have returned home safely. Targeted incursions into
   Gaza and airstrikes against Hamas will persist, and Israel will need to
   fortify a number of strategically significant areas near the border with
   Gaza to create a buffer zone to enhance border defense.

   Meanwhile, the IDF will need to keep an eye on the Lebanese border. Israel
   wants to keep Hezbollah out of the conflict but is prepared for a
   potential escalation on its northern border, whether due to a
   miscalculation or to an Iranian decision to order its proxy to open a new
   front in the war.

   Following the conclusion of the main ground operation in Gaza, Israel will
   need to confront the substantial threat posed by Hezbollah’s elite Radwan
   forces stationed along the Israeli-Lebanese border. These forces are a
   significant menace to Israel’s northern villages and cities, which had
   already been evacuated at the onset of the war in Gaza. Israel must
   mobilize international pressure on Lebanon and Hezbollah to enforce and
   abide by the provisions of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which
   prohibits Hezbollah (and any armed forces other than UN peacekeepers and
   the Lebanese military) from maintaining a military presence south of the
   Litani River, which runs about 18 miles north of the Israeli border, with
   the nearest point only 2.5 miles from the border. If diplomatic efforts
   prove unsuccessful, Israel will stand ready to take military action, even
   at the risk of escalating the hostilities into a broader conflict with
   Hezbollah.

  GAZA AND GEOPOLITICS

   To win this war, Israel will require the support of partners who share its
   strategic interests. A number of Arab states, the United States, and
   European countries will play pivotal roles. Their contributions will
   encompass military funding and support, a global campaign to curtail
   Hamas’s funding, humanitarian assistance for civilians and displaced
   persons within Gaza (and possibly beyond), reconstruction efforts,
   information campaigns to counter anti-Israeli and anti-Jewish propaganda
   worldwide, and, most crucially, the establishment of a legitimate
   governing authority in Gaza.

   Under the leadership of President Joe Biden, the United States has played
   an important role in Israel’s wartime decision-making, counseling
   restraint to prevent escalation in the north, demanding adherence to the
   laws of armed conflict, and pushing Israel to address the humanitarian
   crisis in Gaza. In the weeks since October 7, the Biden administration has
   deployed an unprecedented level of military aid and support. Aircraft
   carriers and U.S. forces have been rushed to the region on an unparalleled
   scale, intended to deter Iran and Hezbollah from intervening in the war,
   to protect American forces in the area from numerous attacks by other
   Iranian-backed Shiite militias, and to offer a robust response to such
   attacks. It is noteworthy, however, that Israel maintains its fundamental
   principle of defending itself by itself, refraining from requesting U.S.
   involvement at the cost of U.S. casualties.

   Many European countries have also demonstrated unwavering support for
   Israel, extending beyond their immediate concerns regarding the safety of
   the European citizens held hostage by Hamas. High-ranking European leaders
   such as French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz,
   and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have visited Israel to express
   solidarity. During his visit in late October, Macron even called for the
   establishment of an international coalition to combat Hamas, modeled on
   the one that has taken on ISIS since 2014.

   To secure the ongoing assistance of American and European leaders, many of
   whom are contending with domestic criticism of their support, Israel needs
   to enhance its geopolitical alignment with the bloc best represented by
   the United States and its NATO allies. This may involve a reevaluation of
   Israel’s Ukraine policy, potentially leading to increased support for
   Kyiv’s defense against Russian aggression. Additionally, Israel should
   strive to further increase humanitarian aid to Gaza, make clear that it
   does not intend to permanently occupy the territory, consistently reaffirm
   its adherence to the laws of war (and acknowledge any errors in that
   regard), and place its mission in Gaza within the context of a broader
   Israeli-Palestinian political process that can advance robust security
   arrangements and sustain the viability of the two-state solution.

     The era of intermittent cycles of fighting and cease-fires in Gaza is
     over.

   In public, the leaders of many Arab states, including those with whom
   Israel maintains relations, have roundly condemned its war in Gaza, driven
   by the fear of unrest and domestic instability. Behind closed doors,
   however, they worry about the threat of a resurgent Hamas, an extremist
   Muslim Brotherhood organization that has always posed a grave threat to
   Arab regimes—and serves the interests of their primary regional rival,
   Iran. Governments in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab
   Emirates fear that any success Hamas achieves in the current struggle will
   embolden Sunni jihadi forces in their own countries and Shiite militias
   that Iran backs in nearby states such as Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen.

   In terms of securing global support for the war against Hamas outside of
   Europe, the United States, and the Gulf, the picture darkens. China and
   Russia have abstained from publicly condemning the Hamas attack, have
   sought to curtail Israel’s efforts to dismantle the organization by
   calling for an immediate cease-fire, and have unleashed anti-Semitic
   propaganda on social media and state-controlled media outlets. For its
   part, Russia is driven by a desire to divert the West’s attention and
   resources away from the war in Ukraine and believes it will benefit from a
   heightened Middle East conflict. There is little reason to think Israel
   can do anything to change Moscow’s orientation.

   China’s position, however, is more nuanced. More than anything, the
   country fears a regional conflict that could trigger a surge in oil prices
   that might damage its flagging post-COVID economic recovery. Given
   Israel’s alignment with the West and the United States, it might be
   difficult for Israel to influence China’s policy toward its war efforts in
   Gaza. But Israel could leverage Beijing’s concerns about regional
   escalation to encourage it to pressure Iran to restrain Hezbollah and its
   proxies in Iraq and Yemen. Simultaneously, Israel must strengthen its
   strategic ties with India, which has notably supported Israel and
   condemned the Hamas attack; strong relations with New Delhi could help
   counter the criticism Israel faces from other countries in the global
   South.

  THE STRUGGLE BACK HOME

   Alongside the complex military and diplomatic operations, Israeli leaders
   must launch a number of initiatives at home that will be no less
   challenging. First, they must begin to restore a sense of normality in a
   traumatized society, beginning with the rebuilding of the communities near
   Gaza’s border devastated by the Hamas attack and the repatriation of
   residents who fled their homes in Israel’s north as a precaution against
   an attack by Hezbollah. Economic activities throughout Israel should
   recommence immediately and should gradually return to their customary
   levels.

   More fundamentally, the government must work to restore trust in the
   state’s institutions among Israeli citizens. This will require new and
   unified leadership, the coordinated mobilization of all government
   ministries, and an official investigation into the origins of the Hamas
   attack. The current government—and especially Netanyahu—is unfit for this
   task. He and his close allies, after all, are responsible for the failure
   to address the problem of Gaza and Hamas over the past 15 years and for
   the unprecedented rift in Israeli society that reduced its preparedness in
   the months leading up to the attack. Israel will have to hold elections as
   soon as possible after the ground operation in Gaza ends, as long as
   security conditions, including in the north, allow for it.

   Even before the main ground operation concludes and Israeli troops
   withdraw, Israel should initiate a dialogue with Arab countries and
   international partners to formulate a plan for the future governance of
   Gaza. The most promising approach would be the establishment of an interim
   administration to oversee the territory until the Palestinian Authority is
   capable of assuming that role. This administration would be led by the
   United States and the five Arab states that have established peace
   agreements with Israel. To pave the way for the PA’s eventual return to
   Gaza, the international community, with Israeli assistance and
   coordination, must work with the PA to build its governing capacities and
   address the corruption in its ranks.

   Significant backing from the affluent Gulf Arab states will be
   indispensable to tackle the diverse economic, political, and security
   aspects of governance in Gaza. In this regard, the renewal of
   normalization talks between Israel and Saudi Arabia is crucial, as will be
   the integration of the kingdom into the project of governing Gaza.
   Tehran’s role in helping Hamas develop in recent years may have heightened
   the level of interest in normalization within the anti-Iranian bloc of
   Arab countries. A new Israeli government committed to strengthening the PA
   and maintaining an open perspective on a two-state solution could further
   propel the normalization process forward.

   A war against Hamas and the possibility of discussing a two-state solution
   may appear to sit uneasily. But since its inception, Hamas has opposed and
   undermined the prospect of two states; whenever talks between Israel and
   the Palestine Liberation Organization seemed to gain momentum, Hamas
   reliably launched terror attacks. The organization adamantly rejects the
   Oslo accords, refuses to acknowledge Israel’s right to exist, and openly
   pursues its destruction. Consequently, the removal of Hamas from power in
   Gaza is not an impediment to the two-state idea: it is a necessary
   (although not sufficient) condition for any positive advancements in the
   Israeli-Palestinian relationship and in the Middle East in general.

  BACK TO BASICS

   In the wake of the trauma of October 7, Israel finds itself in a new
   reality. Going forward, it will have to set aside perceptions, beliefs,
   and assumptions that have become customary in recent years and return to
   some foundational principles that it has neglected.

   To deal with the presence of threatening military forces along its
   borders, Israel may find it necessary to shift from a reactive strategy of
   retaliation to a more proactive approach involving preventive strikes.
   Dismantling the Hamas regime in Gaza will help restore deterrence. The
   country will also need to reassess, enhance, and potentially overhaul its
   early-warning system, especially by increasing the use of human
   intelligence sources. The IDF will also need to shift its focus to
   anticipating breaches and building secondary lines of defense. The onus of
   achieving decisive outcomes will always rest on Israel’s shoulders.
   Despite Israel’s enduring commitment to self-reliance, however, it may
   prove necessary to formulate a more closely coordinated joint strategy
   with the United States, the country’s most steadfast ally, and even some
   additional partners.

   The last time Israel faced a challenge even remotely like this was in
   1973. And at first, the Yom Kippur War seemed like a defeat for Israel;
   the Arab states certainly saw it that way. In the end, however, Israel
   came out on top, and its victory led to a groundbreaking peace agreement
   with Egypt—an outcome that set in motion virtually every positive
   development that has taken place in the region since then. It is too early
   to tell whether Israel will be able to once again turn suffering and loss
   into peace and progress. But even in this grim new reality, there is some
   cause for hope.

     Hamas frees 10 Thai citizens, one Filipino under separate deal: Qatar

   Their release was outside of truce between Israel and Hamas, in which 13
   Israelis were freed for 39 Palestinians.

   Published On 24 Nov 202324 Nov 2023

   Hamas has released a group of 10 Thai nationals and one citizen from the
   Philippines who were being held in Gaza, as part of a separate agreement
   to the one between Israel and the Palestinian group that saw Israeli
   hostages and Palestinian prisoners being freed.

   Majed al-Ansari, a spokesperson of the foreign ministry in Qatar – which
   has played a key mediating role – said on Friday that the Thai nationals
   and Filipino were among a total of 24 captives who were released.

   The Thai nationals, he said, were “currently on their way out of the
   strip” with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).

   They were not covered by the truce deal between Hamas and Israel, and
   Qatar and Egypt mediated a separate deal with Hamas, Thai officials said.

   That negotiation track was opened when Thailand’s foreign minister visited
   Qatar on October 31, which led to a specific agreement with Hamas to
   release the Thais, the officials added. Thai nationals were the single
   biggest group of foreigners taken captive.

   But Thailand’s Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin posted earlier on X that he
   had received confirmation of the release of 12 nationals and that Thai
   embassy officials were to pick them up.

   The group was brought to Rafah and then to the Karem Abu Salem crossing,
   called Kerem Shalom by Israel, east of the Rafah crossing between Egypt
   and the Gaza Strip, Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. They were
   transported to a processing point at the Hatzerim Air Force base and were
   to be taken to the Shamir Medical Centre, southeast of Tel Aviv.

   “At this time, the gender and names of these Thais are not known,” the
   ministry statement said.

   Apart from Qatar and Egypt, the ministry also thanked Israel, Iran,
   Malaysia and the ICRC.

   Iran and Thailand maintain friendly relations and prominent members of
   Thailand’s Muslim minority made unofficial trips to Tehran to seek the
   captives’ freedom, The Associated Press news agency reported.

   Thai Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara had said that his Iranian
   counterpart, who was serving as Thailand’s intermediary with Hamas, had
   told him there would be “good news soon”, the report said.

   At least 23 Thai workers are believed to be among the estimated 240 people
   who were taken captive by Hamas during the October 7 attack.

   An additional 32 Thai workers were killed in the attack in southern
   Israel.

   According to the Thai ministry, some 30,000 Thais were employed mainly in
   Israel’s agricultural sector at the time of the attack. More than 8,600
   Thai workers have been voluntarily repatriated since then.

   Under an agreement with Israel, Thai workers are paid a minimum wage of
   5,300 shekels a month ($2,000), six or seven times more than they earn at
   home.

   Qatar has led weeks of intense negotiations, coordinating with the United
   States and Egypt, to reach an agreement for the freeing of 50 civilian
   hostages from Gaza in return for the release of Palestinian prisoners, a
   brief truce and access to humanitarian aid.

   Thirteen Israelis, including dual nationals, were released by Hamas on
   Friday.

   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged that the captive
   release deal would not spell the end of the war, saying Israel would
   continue its push to “eliminate” Hamas.

   Benny Gantz, a part of Israel’s war cabinet, reiterated at a solidarity
   rally for the families of captives in Tel Aviv that the army will resume
   fighting after the humanitarian pause.

   “I want to assure the families of all the hostages: We will not stop. We
   will resume the efforts and the military action in Gaza to retrieve the
   hostages and restore deterrence,” Gantz said.

   In his first statement since the Israeli captives were released, Netanyahu
   said that their return was “one of the aims of the war and we are
   committed to achieving all the aims of the war”.

IDF confirms released hostages are inside Israel

   The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have confirmed that the Israeli hostages
   freed from Gaza are now in Israel and have undergone medical checks.

   A statement from the IDF reads:

     The released hostages underwent an initial medical assessment inside
     Israeli territory. They will continue to be accompanied by IDF soldiers
     as they make their way to Israeli hospitals, where they will be reunited
     with their families.

   Axios’ Barak Ravid has shared the full IDF statement in English:

Closing summary

   It’s turned 7.15am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv and we’ll close this blog in
   a moment. Our live coverage of the Israel-Hamas war will resume soon, and
   in the meantime you can see all our coverage here. Here’s where things
   stand.

     * The first group of hostages were released by Hamas – 13 Israelis, 10
       Thais and a Philippine national – on Friday. The 13 Israelis, who
       included very young children and older women, had reached their home
       country by early evening. The Thai ministry said it “will do all
       possible to expedite” the return of their nationals to Thailand.
       Israel has received a list of hostages who are expected to be released
       by Hamas on Saturday, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s
       office says.

     * Thirty-nine Palestinian prisoners were released by Israel on Friday
       evening. They consisted of 24 women, including some convicted of
       attempted murder for attacks on Israeli forces, and 15 teenagers
       jailed for offences such as throwing stones. Celebrations have been
       taking place in the occupied West Bank following their release.

     * The hostage release came as part of a deal that has brought about a
       temporary pause in hostilities, with the four-day ceasefire marking
       the first break in seven weeks of war in Gaza. Under the agreement,
       Hamas is due to free at least 50 of the about 240 mostly Israeli
       hostages it has held since launching attacks into southern Israel on 7
       October in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed. In
       return, Israel will release at least 150 Palestinian prisoners and
       allow up to 300 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza.

     * The families of the 10 Thai hostages released on Friday had been
       notified, Thailand’s ministry of foreign affairs said, and the group
       was now with officials from the Thai embassy. The ministry also said
       there were now an estimated 20 Thai nationals who were still being
       held in Gaza.

     * US president Joe Biden said the chances were “real” that a temporary
       ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be extended. Biden said
       Friday’s hostage release was the “start of a process” and that he
       “will not stop” until all remaining hostages in Gaza were brought
       home. The deal reached by Israel and Hamas involved “extensive US
       diplomacy”, he said, adding: “It’s only a start, but so far it’s gone
       well.” Biden also said he expected American citizens to be among the
       hostages who would be released.

     * Most of the Israeli hostages released by Hamas were said to be in good
       health after returning to Israel, the hospital receiving them
       announced. Schneider Children’s hospital, where four women and four
       child hostages were released, said doctors had conducted a preliminary
       examination and said they were all in in good physical condition.

     * Some 137 trucks of goods were offloaded by the UN agency for
       Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reception point in the Gaza Strip on
       Friday. The UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs
       said it was “the biggest humanitarian convoy received” in Gaza since 7
       October. In addition, 129,000 litres of fuel and four trucks of gas
       also crossed into Gaza, it said.

     * Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos said on X that he was
       “overjoyed” to confirm that a Filipino, Gelienor “Jimmy” Pacheco, was
       among the first group of hostages released on Friday. Pacheco was
       working as a carer when he was captured by Hamas during the 7 October
       attacks.

     * The World Health Organisation has voiced concern about the fate of the
       head of Gaza City’s al-Shifa hospital, whom Israeli forces detained
       over the facility’s alleged use by Hamas.

     * Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters are expected to gather
       in London for the latest demonstration calling for a permanent
       ceasefire in Gaza. The Metropolitan police will be on high alert and
       about 1,500 officers will be deployed for the protests on Saturday.

     * The Israeli offensive on Gaza has killed more than 14,000 people,
       thousands of them children, according to Palestinian officials. More
       are thought to be buried under rubble. At least 1,200 people, mostly
       civilians, were killed in the Hamas attacks on 7 October, and more
       than 240 people taken hostage.

   The war is paused, but it is not over.

   There will be relief at the promised four days of quiet between Israel and
   Hamas, and there will be joy for the families waiting to be reunited with
   loved ones, thanks to Friday’s exchange of hostages held in Gaza for
   prisoners held in Israel.

   But even if the ceasefire is extended, perhaps in return for the release
   of more Hamas-held captives, this war will not be over anytime soon. If
   anything, it is likely to intensify.

   It is too big to stop now, it runs too deep. And it has already turned
   Israel upside down.

   You only have to spend a few days in the country to see that. The war is
   everywhere.

   In case you missed this earlier, Jonathan Freedland has spoken to
   survivors, displaced people and senior political and military figures
   about life in Israel before and after 7 October, and considers the
   longer-term ramifications:

WHO concerned for arrested al-Shifa hospital chief

   The World Health Organisation has voiced concern about the fate of the
   head of Gaza City’s al-Shifa hospital, whom Israeli forces detained over
   the facility’s alleged use by Hamas.

   The WHO said in a statement that the chief of the Gaza Strip’s biggest
   hospital, Mohammad Abu Salmiya, had been arrested on Wednesday along with
   five other health workers while they were taking part in a UN mission to
   evacuate patients, Agence France-Presse reports.

   “Three medical personnel from the Palestine Red Crescent Society and three
   from the ministry of health were detained,” the WHO said.

   Since then two of the six have reportedly been released, but “we do not
   have information about the well-being of the four remaining health staff,
   including the director of al-Shifa hospital”, the statement added.

   The UN agency called for “their legal and human rights to be fully
   observed during their detention”.

   A spokesperson for the Israeli army said on Saturday that Abu Salmiya was
   being questioned. Doron Spielman said:

     We are currently moving forward with... questioning him over the fact
     that he was the head of a hospital that was really sitting on top of an
     entire terror network.

     How could he not know what’s happening? We have hostages that were on,
     you know, CCTV in his hospital.

   The Israeli army, which raided the hospital last week, has alleged Hamas
   fighters used a tunnel complex beneath the facility. Hamas and hospital
   officials have repeatedly denied the claims.

   During the WHO’s latest mission to the hospital on Wednesday – carried out
   in cooperation with the Palestine Red Crescent – 151 people were
   evacuated, including patients, their relatives and healthcare workers,
   according to the WHO.

Israel reviews list of Hamas hostages to be freed on Saturday

   Israel has received a list of hostages set to be freed by Hamas from Gaza
   on Saturday, Israeli officials said, following the release of 24 hostages
   on Friday – the first of a planned four-day ceasefire.

   Reuters reports that Israeli security officials were reviewing the list,
   prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement, after his
   government’s vow to work for the release of all hostages taken by Hamas in
   the militant group’s attack on southern Israel on 7 October.

   The pause in the fighting was the first such break, with both sides saying
   hostilities would resume as soon as the truce ends. US president Joe
   Biden, however, expressed hope the pause could be extended.

   The released hostages, including Israeli women and children and Thai farm
   workers, were transferred from Gaza and handed to Egyptian authorities at

   Committee of the Red Cross in a four-car convoy, the organisation said.

   They were then taken to Israel for medical checks and reunions with
   relatives.

Twenty Thais still captive in Gaza, says Thailand, after 10 freed

   Thailand’s ministry of foreign affairs said the families of the 10 Thai
   hostages released by Hamas on Friday had been notified, and the group was
   now with officials from the Thai embassy.

   The ministry said in a statement.

     This group will stay in the hospital for at least 48 hours, while RTE
     [the royal Thai embassy] will make all the necessary arrangements for
     their travel back to Thailand and their families as soon as possible.

   The ministry has confirmed that 10 Thai hostages were released on Friday,
   not 12 as was initially suggested by Thai authorities.

   The ministry also said there were now an estimated 20 Thai nationals who
   were still being held in Gaza. It was previously thought that at least 26
   Thai nationals had been abducted, including the 10 people recently
   released. However, of the group of 10 released on Friday, four had not
   previously been confirmed as hostages.

   The ministry thanked all governments and organisations who helped to
   secure Friday’s release, saying:

     The Thai government would like to express, once again, its deepest
     appreciation to all of the parties from whom the Thai authorities had
     sought assistance and support, such as the governments of Qatar, Israel,
     Egypt, Iran, Malaysia and the ICRC [International Committee of the Red
     Cross], as well as others involved in the immense efforts that led to
     this recent release.

     We sincerely hope that the remaining hostages will be treated humanely
     and released safely as soon as possible.

   Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos has said on X that he is “overjoyed”
   to confirm that a Filipino, Gelienor “Jimmy” Pacheco, was among the first
   group of hostages released on Friday.

   Pacheco was working as a carer when he was captured by Hamas during the 7
   October attacks.

   Marcos added:

     He is now safely in the custody of officials in our Israel Embassy. I
     salute the work of the Philippine Foreign Service in securing his
     release, and once again thank the State of Qatar for their invaluable
     assistance in making Jimmy’s release possible.

   Marcos said the search for a second missing person continued.

     We remain concerned over the whereabouts of our other national, Ms
     Noralyn Babadilla, and are sparing no effort to locate and secure her if
     she is indeed found to be one of the hostages. We pray for the continued
     success of the truce and for all hostages to be released.

     I am overjoyed to confirm that a Filipino, Mr. Gelienor “Jimmy” Pacheco,
     was among the first group of 24 hostages released by the Hamas
     yesterday.

   The Metropolitan police said officers would hand out leaflets to provide
   “absolute clarity” on what would be deemed at Saturday’s pro-Palestinian
   rally in London, where tens of thousands are expected to call for a
   permanent ceasefire in Gaza.

   Deputy assistant commissioner Ade Adelekan said:

     This sets out that anyone who is racist or incites hatred against any
     group should expect to be arrested. As should anyone who supports Hamas
     or any other banned organisation.

   Organisers Stop the War coalition said such a measure was “intrusive” but
   asked anyone attending to avoid “any actions that might leave you or
   others around you open to arrest”.

   The afternoon will also see a protest by Hizb-ut-Tahrir outside the
   Egyptian embassy. It is the first by the group since 21 October, after a
   video emerged showing a man chanting “jihad”, prompting an outcry from
   politicians.

   A march organised by the charity Campaign Against Antisemitism is also due
   to take place on Sunday, with about 40,000 to 50,000 people expected to
   attend.

London police on high alert over major pro-Palestinian protest

   Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters are expected to gather in
   London for the latest demonstration calling for a permanent ceasefire in
   Gaza.

   PA Media reports that about 1,500 officers will be deployed for the
   protests, which come amid the temporary truce in the war and Hamas’
   release of 24 hostages, along with Israel’s release of 39 Palestinian
   prisoners.

   The Metropolitan police will be on high alert in the capital, after a
   previous rally on Armistice Day saw scenes of violent disorder after
   counter-protesters clashed with officers.

   The Met had come under severe pressure from politicians over the decision
   to allow that march to go ahead, with former home secretary Suella
   Braverman accusing the force of showing bias in favour of leftwing
   protesters.

   About 100,000 people are expected to march on Saturday from Park Lane to
   Whitehall, as organisers rejected the label of “hate march” deployed by
   Braverman before she was sacked by prime minister Rishi Sunak.

   Most of the Israeli hostages released by Hamas were said to be in good
   health after returning to Israel, the hospital receiving them announced.

   A statement from Schneider Children’s hospital, where four women and four
   child hostages were released, said doctors had conducted a preliminary
   examination and said they were all in in good physical condition,
   Associated Press reports.

   A total of 13 Israeli hostages were freed on Friday and transferred to

   Reuters has posted a video report on displaced Palestinians in Gaza saying
   they’re not being allowed to return north as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire
   continues.

   A man beside a road in Khan Younis, in the territory’s south, says in the

     They didn’t let us go back to Gaza City to see our children. They’re
     young and don’t know their way ... No one knows what to do or how we

   As we posted earlier, Israeli troops fatally shot two Palestinians and
   wounded 11 others on Friday as they headed toward northern Gaza,
   Associated Press reported.

   The shooting took place as hundreds of Palestinians who sought refuge in
   southern Gaza were seen trying to head back to the north, despite warnings
   by the Israeli army not to attempt to return to their homes.

   Witnesses said Israeli troops were opening fire on people trying to head
   north.

   An AP journalist saw the two bodies and the wounded as they arrived at a
   hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah in the southern half of Gaza. The
   injured people had been shot in the legs.

   For the families of the Israelis hostages freed by Hamas, there was
   happiness mingled with concern for those who remained in Gaza, Reuters
   reports.

   “I am happy I received my family back, it’s allowed to feel joy and it’s
   allowed to shed a tear. That’s a human thing,” said Yoni Katz Asher, whose
   wife Doron and children Raz and Aviv were freed on Friday.

     But I am not celebrating, I will not celebrate until the last of the
     hostages returns home.

   Israeli leaders have sworn to free the rest of the hostages as the
   military pursues its invasion of Gaza in the wake of Hamas’ attack on 7
   October.

   For the moment, the hostages are being kept away from the media while
   their condition is assessed. And for those whose relatives have not come
   home, the wait continues in a conflicting swirl of feelings.

   “The emotions are mixed emotions,” said Shelly Shem Tov, the mother Omer
   Shem Tov, 21, who had attended the outdoor Supernova dance festival that
   was targeted in the attack and was among those taken hostage. He was not
   among those released on Friday.

   “I’m excited for the families who today are going to hug their loved
   ones,” she said in an interview with Israel’s Channel 12.

     I am jealous. And I am sad. Mostly sad that Omer is still not coming
     home.

   Hamas released the first group of hostages – 13 Israelis, 10 Thais and a
   Philippine national – on Friday, while Israel released 39 Palestinian
   prisoners.

   Organisers of a march against antisemitism billed as Britain’s biggest
   since the second world war have demanded that the far-right leader Stephen
   Yaxley-Lennon stay away.

   Yaxley-Lennon, who uses the name Tommy Robinson, has claimed to support
   the aims of the march through central London due to be held this Sunday.

   Organisers say it will be the biggest protest against anti-Jewish hatred
   since the 1936 Cable Street protests against Oswald Mosley’s blackshirts.

   Britain’s Jewish communities have suffered a large rise in antisemitism
   since the Middle East exploded into crisis after the Hamas attacks against
   Israel on 7 October. Police said up to 50,000 people were expected at
   Sunday’s march.

   A spokesperson for Campaign Against Antisemitism said:

     Contrary to what Tommy Robinson appears to believe, the drunken
     far-right thugs who came to ‘protect the Cenotaph’ on Armistice Day,
     some of whom shouted ‘sieg heil’ or hospitalised police officers, are
     not allies of the Jewish community and are not welcome at our solidarity
     march on Sunday 26 November.

     We look forward to seeing those who genuinely support our community and
     invite all of our allies to join us and march shoulder to shoulder in
     solidarity with British Jews.

   On 11 November, Armistice Day, Robinson supporters were among those who
   attacked police after claiming to be protecting war monuments from
   pro-Palestine marchers.

   The Met deputy assistant commissioner Ade Adelekan said:

     Having spoken to the Campaign Against Antisemitism, Tommy Robinson is
     not welcome at the march on Sunday.

   Police said they were aware that Robinson might try to attend posing as a
   reporter.

WHO 'extremely concerned' about safety of patients at al-Shifa after hospital
director arrested

   The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is “extremely concerned”
   about the safety of the estimated 100 patients and health worker remaining
   at Gaza’s al-Shifa hospital.

   In a statement published today, the WHO said it did not “have information
   about the well-being” of four health workers who have been arrested,
   including the director of al-Shifa hospital.

   On Thursday, Mohammad abu Salmiya and other medics were reportedly
   arrested by members of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) as they were
   travelling with a WHO evacuation convoy.

   The WHO said it participated in a “high-risk mission” on Wednesday, in
   cooperation with the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), to transfer
   151 patients, relatives and health workers from al-Shifa.

   During the screening process by members of the IDF, three medical
   personnel from the PRCS and three from the health ministry were detained,
   it said. The statement continued:

     Two of the six detained health workers have reportedly been released. We
     do not have information about the well-being of the four remaining
     health staff, including the director of Al-Shifa hospital. WHO calls for
     their legal and human rights to be fully observed during their
     detention.

   The IDF has confirmed Abu Salmiya had been arrested and transferred to the
   Shin Bet domestic security service for further questioning. It said that
   al-Shifa “under his direct management, served as a Hamas command and
   control centre” and that Hamas fighters had sought refuge in the hospital.

'Real' chance of ceasefire extension, says Biden; putting conditions on Israel
aid 'worthwhile thought'

   Joe Biden has said the chances were “real” that a temporary ceasefire
   between Israel and Hamas could be extended.

   The pause in hostilities, which began this morning and will initially last
   four or five days, was announced early on Wednesday and has raised hopes
   for a more durable pause in the violence.

   The US president, speaking to reporters from Nantucket, Massachusetts
   earlier today, was asked whether the truce could be extended, Reuters
   reported. He replied:

     I think the chances are real.

   Asked what his expectations were, Biden said “I don’t know how long it
   will take,” adding:

     My expectation and hope is that as we move forward, the rest of the Arab
     world and the region is also putting pressure on all sides to slow this
     down, to bring this to an end as quickly as we can.

   He also said that conditioning military aid to Israel was a “worthwhile
   thought, but I don’t think if I started off with that we would have ever
   gotten where we are today”, AP reported.

   “It is absolutely necessary to establish a lasting humanitarian ceasefire
   to reverse the catastrophic situation that the people of the [Gaza] Strip

   Alexander De Croo, Belgium’s prime minister, echoed Sánchez, saying: “The
   destruction of Gaza is unacceptable. We cannot accept that a society is
   being destroyed the way it is being destroyed.”

                     A roadmap for the future of Palestine

   At this critical juncture, Palestine’s leaders should come together to
   craft a clear strategy for reunifying the Palestinian people

   As Israel continues its war on Gaza, which is causing loss of life and
   displacement at a scale that has led to it being labeled a “genocide” by
   various experts, the Palestinian liberation struggle is at a critical
   juncture.

   Despite undoubtedly recognising the importance of the current moment,
   however, Palestinian political factions, including Hamas and Fatah among
   others, appear unable to come together and lay out a coherent and
   realistic vision for the future of Palestine. It’s imperative for them to
   set aside their differences, acknowledge their moral responsibilities to
   the nation, and come together to craft a clear strategy for reunifying the
   Palestinian people. Such a strategy must not only thwart Israel’s
   well-defined and openly discussed plan to ethnically cleanse Gaza and
   detach it from the Palestinian homeland, but also respond to Israeli
   efforts to displace Palestinians in the West Bank and Israel itself.

   end of list

   As a Palestinian from Gaza, I believe at this point in the conflict,
   opportunities are ripe for putting an end to the ongoing war in Gaza,
   uniting the Palestinian factions, and launching a new political path to
   end the occupation. There are 10 clear steps that could and should be
   taken, starting with Palestinian leaders, to achieve this and put our
   nation on a direct path towards justice, peace and statehood:

    1. First and foremost, all Palestinian factions should commit to the
       fulfilment and eventual expansion of the Qatar-brokered agreement to
       exchange Israeli captives in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli
       jails.
    2. Hamas should declare its acceptance of and commitment to the Fatah
       reconciliation agreement it signed in Cairo in 2017. It should call on
       the Palestinian Authority to assume its responsibilities in Gaza and
       also reassert the commitment of resistance factions in Gaza to all
       agreements signed by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). To
       counter Israel’s destructive post-war plans for Gaza, Palestinian
       leaders should establish an interim governing council for the Strip
       comprising technocrats from the region. All past Palestinian Authority
       personnel from Gaza, including the police, should be called upon to
       return to their duties. This plan should also include retaining
       civilian Hamas employees, including the police. The reintegration of
       Hamas fighters and weaponry into the Palestinian Authority forces
       after the end of the war should also remain under consideration.
    3. Hamas should publicly acknowledge the Peace Accords signed between
       Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the
       foundation for a peace process, and agree to the scheduling of
       elections for the entire Palestinian territory within one year. In
       return, Israel should be pressured to recognise a reformed Hamas as a
       mainstream Palestinian political faction and a party to future
       negotiations.
    4. The PLO should be reactivated and reformed in a way that would ensure
       the representation of all Palestinian parties and components within
       its structures. Particular emphasis should be placed on empowering
       young Palestinians, both men and women, taking on consequential roles
       within the organisation and have a say in the future of Palestine. The
       reformed PLO should include not only Fatah, Hamas and other PLO
       factions, but also representatives from the Palestinian diaspora, as
       well as independent representatives from across the nation. Members of
       the organisation should be reelected every four years in free and fair
       elections, and it should be agreed that the organisation will have the
       final say in all critical issues concerning the Palestinian people
       until an independent Palestinian state is established.
    5. The reconstruction of Gaza should start immediately under
       international and Arab supervision. While the international community
       should contribute to funding the project, the brunt of the financial
       burden should be put on Israel as the occupying power responsible for
       causing the destruction. The reconstruction effort should be used to
       put Gaza on the path to achieving sustainable economic growth. It
       should also aim to address the rapid depletion of the Strip’s
       environmental resources as a result of the occupation, including
       issues relating to water and electricity shortages, shrinking fishing
       areas, and destruction of agricultural land among others.
    6. Israel should be made to set up a compensation fund for the families –
       both Israeli and Palestinian – victimised by its wars, aggressions and
       occupation. Western countries adopted the idea that Russia would be
       compelled to pay for its war in Ukraine, and Ukraine would be rebuilt
       using frozen Russian assets. The Palestinian leadership should insist
       that the same responsibility is imposed on Israel.
    7. International observers should be deployed along Israel’s borders to
       prevent confrontations. Turkiye [Turkey], which is accepted as an
       honest broker by the Palestinians and has strong relations with the
       West and Israel as a NATO member, could be asked to take on this
       important responsibility.
    8. The siege on Gaza should be lifted, fully and unconditionally, with
       its border crossings, airports and ports reopened and its residents
       given full freedom of movement. A permanent and secure passage between
       Gaza and the West Bank should also be established. Turkiye can also
       play a crucial role in opening Gaza up to the world, by establishing
       maritime and aerial bridges for reconstruction and development.
    9. Israel should be pressured to immediately and unconditionally halt all
       its settlement activities and initiate comprehensive negotiations for
       bringing an end to its occupation under UN auspices, based on the 1967
       borders, and within a pre-set timeframe of no more than three years.
       The Arab League should continue to push for its 2002 Arab Peace
       Initiative which called for all Arab states to recognise and normalise
       relations with Israel in exchange for the establishment of a
       Palestinian state on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its
       capital. Any further attempts at normalisation should be frozen until
       this is achieved.
   10. Finally, if this political track towards sustainable peace and
       dignified co-existence fails or faces a significant roadblock, a
       reformed PLO that is kept in check by the Palestinian people through
       regular elections should be accepted as the sole entity that could
       decide on the future direction and nature of the Palestinian struggle
       for liberation.

Israel-Hamas war: North Korea's bloody fingerprints are over October 7 - opinion

North Korea has shown itself to be nothing less than an enemy of Israel. It has
close ties with Iran and Syria and has backed Hamas and Hezbollah.

   In the seven weeks since Hamas invaded Israel and massacred over 1,200
   people, growing international attention has been directed toward the
   terrorist organization’s primary backers and paymasters, chief among them
   Iran and Qatar.

   The two autocratic regimes, which have provided Hamas with various forms
   of support over the course of many years, both bear responsibility for the
   savagery that was inflicted by their Gaza-based client. Largely
   overlooked, however, has been the role of yet another nefarious
   dictatorship, one that also deserves to be held to account for the part
   that it played in the largest mass murder of Jews since the Holocaust. 

   While its capital city of Pyongyang may be 8,000 kilometers away, the
   North Korean regime’s bloody fingerprints are in fact all over the October
   7 Hamas atrocities. And Kim Jong Un’s evil Stalinist state must not go
   unpunished for the chaos that it helped to unleash. Although North Korea’s
   state-run news agency has vehemently denied any involvement, the facts on
   the ground indicate otherwise.

  How did North Korea help Hamas carry out the October 7 massacre against
  Israel?

   To begin with, Hamas used weapons that were made in the Hermit Kingdom. 

   On October 19, the Associated Press (AP) reported, based on information
   provided by South Korean officials, two experts on North Korean arms, as
   well as the AP’s own analysis of weapons captured by Israel on the
   battlefield, that Hamas was using Pyongyang’s F-7 rocket-propelled
   grenade, or RPGs. North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un and Russia's Defence

   “North Korea has long supported Palestinian militant [terrorist] groups,
   and North Korean arms have previously been documented amongst interdicted
   supplies,” arms expert N.R. Jenzen-Jones told AP.

   He further added, based on video imagery of the October 7 assault, that
   the terrorist group was employing North Korea’s Type 58 self-loading
   rifle, a variant of the Kalashnikov assault rifle. In other words, it is
   highly likely that at least some of the Israelis who were murdered by
   Hamas died at the hands of weapons provided by North Korea. Indeed, on
   October 26, Agence France-Presse quoted an Israeli military official as
   saying that 10% of the weapons used by Hamas in the attacks had originated
   in North Korea. South Korean military and intelligence sources concur.

   On October 17, a senior official from South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff
   was quoted by UPI as saying, “Hamas is believed to be directly or
   indirectly linked to North Korea in various areas, such as the weapons
   trade, tactical guidance, and training.”

   “The official also noted,” the report said, “that North Korean-made
   122-mm. multiple rocket launchers were provided to an armed group related
   to Hamas, and artillery shells marked ‘Bang-122’ – the same as ammunition
   used by North Korea – were found on the Israel-Gaza border.”

   In addition to providing Hamas with the means to murder, Pyongyang may
   also have assisted with the know-how.

   Back in December 2016, Kim Jong Un publicly presided over a military
   training exercise of North Korean paragliders simulating an assault on the
   South Korean presidential residence in Seoul. And that tactic is precisely
   what Hamas utilized as part of its coordinated attack on Israel on October
   7.

   “There is a possibility that this know-how was passed on to Hamas,” the
   South Korean official told UPI. His remarks were later confirmed by the
   South Korean Defense Ministry.

   THE RELATIONSHIP between Hamas and North Korea is actually not new and
   stretches back for years.

   Nearly a decade ago, on July 26, 2014, the UK Daily Telegraph reported
   that Hamas had made a down payment to Pyongyang to acquire missiles and
   communications equipment as part of a larger arms deal. The paper noted
   that “Hamas has forged close links with North Korea, which is keen to
   support groups that are opposed to Western interests in the region.” It
   also cited unnamed Israeli military commanders as saying that North Korean
   experts had been advising Hamas on how to build its network of underground
   terror tunnels based on those that Pyongyang constructed decades ago
   beneath the demilitarized zone with South Korea.

   Prior to that, in 2009, a shipment from North Korea of 35 tons of military
   materiel, which included rockets, was seized in Thailand. It was later
   revealed that it had been intended for delivery to Iran, which was
   planning to smuggle the weapons to Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

   And last month, in an article on the 38 North website, a publication of
   the Stimson Center, Dr. Samuel Ramani highlighted the history of “North
   Korea’s covert alliance with Iran-aligned militias in the Middle East.”

   These ties stretch back to the 1970s when Pyongyang provided weapons to
   Yasser Arafat and training to other Palestinian terrorist groups.

   By any measure, North Korea has shown itself to be nothing less than an
   enemy of Israel. It has close ties with Iran and Syria, has backed Hamas
   and Hezbollah, and provided arms and know-how to those who seek to destroy
   the Jewish state.

   Kim Jong Un may be pudgy and puerile, but he is perilous too. It is
   therefore essential that Israel take a more forceful public stand against
   North Korea and continue to strengthen relations with South Korea, which
   can serve as an important partner in trying to contain Pyongyang’s Middle
   Eastern mischief.

   And we must raise greater awareness about North Korea’s support for groups
   such as Hamas, which underlines how Kim’s regime is a force for
   instability not only in the Far East but around the globe.

   Simply put, North Korea has Jewish blood on its hands. It cannot be
   allowed to act with impunity. 

         Israel-Hamas truce comes into effect: How it could now unfold

   With the truce the first break in fighting after seven weeks, several
   scenarios in the war are now possible.

   The mother of the longest-serving female Palestinian prisoner in Israeli
   jails is gripped with anxiety, but for once, optimism too.

   The mother of another prisoner arrested just months after he turned 18, is
   baking chocolate cake and other pastries in anticipation of his release.

  Israel-Hamas deal: What makes a truce lead to lasting peace?

   end of list

   In Israel, a grandfather wonders whether his three-year-old granddaughter
   will be released, the toddler among six other family members held captive
   by Hamas.

   A Tel Aviv developmental psychologist, meanwhile, worries about the
   post-trauma signs in children when they return from Gaza.

   On Friday morning at 7am local time (05:00 GMT), the truce between Israel
   and Hamas came into force, marking the first break in Israel’s continuous
   seven-week bombardment of the Gaza Strip following Hamas’s October 7
   attack on southern Israel.

   The four-day pause is expected to see the exchange of 150 Palestinian
   women and children imprisoned in Israeli jails for 50 women and children
   hostages held by Hamas. It also offers an opportunity for aid to filter
   into the battered enclave where nearly 15,000 people have been killed in
   the bombing, including more than 6,000 children.

   Israeli officials, while adamant that the truce is not an end to the war,
   have also agreed to pause fighting for an additional day for every further
   10 captives freed by Hamas.

   With the truce the first breakthrough in coaxing a cessation of
   hostilities after weeks of fighting, several scenarios are possible now
   that it has come into effect.

   Here is a look at some of them:

   INTERACTIVE - Gaza truce deal possible scenarios-1700745219(Al Jazeera)

The truce holds

   First, the truce may very well hold, the agreement respected by both
   parties.

   While the prisoners and captives are exchanged, humanitarian aid may enter
   not just southern Gaza as it has in the past few weeks, but could also
   enter northern Gaza, where Israeli forces are staging a ground assault,
   said Aboud Hamayel, a lecturer at Birzeit University in the occupied West
   Bank.

   But while humanitarian aid there will be welcomed, the truce will also
   prompt the question of what should be done with northern Gaza, as it has
   largely been emptied of Palestinians, said Sami Hamdi, the managing
   director at International Interest, a political risk firm focusing on the
   Middle East.

   “There will be increasingly loud voices demanding that these Palestinian
   families be allowed to return to northern Gaza in order to reverse the
   Israeli attempt at ethnic cleansing,” Hamdi told Al Jazeera.

   Despite this, the pause in fighting would be a lifeline for many
   Palestinians, an opportunity for them to recuperate and “take out people
   from under rubble”, Hamayel told Al Jazeera.

   In Israel, the return of captives may deliver a small public relations
   victory for embattled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has
   been facing mounting pressure from their families since their capture, the
   analyst said.

   But it was international pressure in addition to the families’ pressure
   which obliged the Israeli leader to accept the truce after weeks of
   refusing similar deals, said Hamdi.

   International pressure will therefore be critical to ensuring that both
   sides uphold the truce, agreed Hamayel, with Western actors particularly
   interested in maintaining regional stability so that the oil economy
   doesn’t become too volatile.

The truce is extended

   If international pressure succeeds, or if Hamas agrees to free more of the
   237 currently held captives, there may be the possibility that the truce
   not only sticks, but holds beyond the initial four days, for up to about
   three weeks.

   Both sides could use this longer lull in fighting to convalesce, rearrange
   their troops and gather intelligence for the next phase of the war, said
   Hamayel.

   Israel may also use the pause to scope out Hamas tunnels, which it hasn’t
   yet done, but has hinted at doing.

   Israel, while signalling it has no intention of ending the war, may also
   prefer a longer pause as the war is draining its economy and affecting its
   tourism, said Hamayel.

   Meanwhile, it may ramp up its raids in the occupied West Bank as the Gaza
   front cools, the analyst said. More than 226 people have been killed and
   more than 2,750 injured in the West Bank since October 7.

The truce breaks

   The scenario opposite the two previous ones is of the truce breaking, with
   Israel having more incentives to break it than Hamas, the analysts said.

   Hamas doesn’t want to lose credibility with its mediators, while the
   situation for Palestinian civilians is too dire for the group to risk not
   giving them a respite from fighting, said Hamayel.

   Meanwhile, Netanyahu has failed to achieve any of the strategic objectives
   that he claimed to be seeking when he began military operations, and which
   compel him to continue the fighting, said Hamdi.

   “He hasn’t been able to kill any high-profile Hamas officials. He hasn’t
   been able to wipe out Hamas in Gaza,’ Hamdi said.

   But Hamas and its regional allies would not take Israel’s breaking of the
   truce lightly, with the Palestinian armed group expected to fire missiles
   on Israel in response, and the possibility of a gradual escalation in
   tensions on multiple fronts of the war, said Hamayel.

   It is also possible that Hamas may break the truce, with such a response
   not only prompting Western ire at the group, but it would likely ramp up
   Israeli aggression from both the air and ground, he added.

   Its regional allies would still err on the side of caution, and would work
   towards pursuing a de-escalation of the conflict, said Hamdi.

A path to ending the war?

   Meanwhile, there is a concern among Israeli officials, including
   Netanyahu’s allies, that “this hostage exchange is essentially a bid to
   lure Israel into a permanent ceasefire”, said Hamdi.

   The prime minister has, as a result, been making assurances that military
   operations will continue, he added. On Thursday, Israel’s Defence Minister
   Yoav Gallant said that the war would continue for at least another two
   months after the end of the truce.

   But international pressure for a ceasefire is mounting. That was the
   majority view at a summit of the BRICS grouping earlier this week, the
   world’s most powerful bloc of emerging economies. United Nations
   Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has also called for a humanitarian
   ceasefire.

   The truce has opened up a possibility for more diplomatic engagements and
   solutions to the possible end of a bloody, bitter conflict that has
   gripped the world, said Hamayel.

                  Israel-Hamas conflict is the West’s war too

   Patience and tolerance toward a radical ideology that doesn’t recognize
   the legitimacy of your way of life is the greatest enemy of peace and
   coexistence.

   Gideon Sa’ar is a minister in the Israeli Government, a member of the
   Security Cabinet and chairman of the New Hope Party.

   In 2005 Israel withdrew from Gaza. It uprooted every Israeli and every
   community. Every Israeli grave was relocated. All soldiers were withdrawn,
   and military bases shuttered. Israel unilaterally withdrew to the pre-1967
   border.

   Gaza has always been an epicenter of hate, incitement, and terrorism
   against Israel. Since Israel’s withdrawal, instead of choosing prosperity
   and peace, instead of developing Gaza into the Singapore of the Middle
   East, Hamas and Islamic Jihad decided to use the entity as a launching pad
   for their armies to wage their war against Israel.

   In the past decades and elsewhere in the Middle East (Lebanon, Yemen and
   others), Islamist terrorists have taken control and created “terror
   states” that operate and function completely differently from normal
   sovereign states.

Against antisemitism: Belgian and European Jews need your solidarity

   By Ariel Muzicant

   They’re not just a “terrorist organization” acting within the territory of
   another country. They control every aspect of the territory they occupy
   and exploit resources and civilian populations for their war effort. This
   is the phenomenon of a terrorist state.

   The barbarous attacks of Hamas on October 7 against Israeli civilians were
   an act of state madness, aside from the utter immorality of mass murder
   and rape. It is not rational to start an all-out war against a much
   stronger country. But their rationale is different. It is fanatical.

   To grasp the antisemitic and psychotic state of mind of this movement, it
   is enough to read Hamas’s founding charter.

   According to Hamas, the murder of Jews is a religious commandment.
   According to the charter, Jews, in their minds, are responsible for every
   war or destructive historical event, including those where Jews themselves
   were victims. Among the events, the French Revolution, the Communist
   Revolution, the First and Second World Wars, the founding of the League of
   Nations (to control the world), and the establishment of the UN.

   In their eyes the entire land of Israel is sacred to Muslims until the
   resurrection of the dead and therefore nobody has the authority to
   relinquish any part of it whatsoever.

   To try and legitimize the barbaric massacre that took place on October 7
   is as absurd as trying to find justification for the perverse, murderous
   attack by al-Qaeda against the U.S. on September 11 2001. It’s the same
   madness, the same extremism, the same cruel murderousness.

   The reason for the attack on Israel was simple: Hamas wants to destroy the
   state of Israel. Hamas’ conflict with Israel is not a territorial one, it
   is a total ideological one.

   Since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, radical Islam has become an ideological
   rival of the democratic West. Radical Islam totally rejects Western values
   and wants to destroy Western civilization — so much for Francis Fukuyama’s
   theory of “the end of history.”

   Strategically, as it did on September 11, or during terror attacks
   inspired, encouraged and sometimes organized in European cities, radical
   Islam always seeks to attack people as well as nations on their own soil
   and in their own homes. It’s an attempt to undermine a sense of safety and
   security and to instil fear. Hamas’ charter states that no one will enjoy
   peace and security unless under the control of Islam.

   There is only one way to deal with terror states. Total war that ends with
   the destruction of the regime and its military capabilities — like the war
   the United States led against ISIS or like the Second World War. Truth be
   told, you cannot wipe out an ideology — after all, there are still Nazis
   in the world. But the danger they pose today is different from the Nazi
   regime.

   Radical ideologies are far more dangerous when they control or form a
   state, or a territorial caliphate. That is why the United States, along
   with its allies in the Middle East and Europe, decided it couldn’t allow
   Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s Islamic State to persist. The same goes for Hamas.

   During the nine-month-long battle for Mosul, the world saw ISIS use
   thousands of people as human shields. Thousands were kidnapped and
   executed who didn’t want to be human shields. ISIS terrorists shot
   civilians who sought to flee to safety. Hamas operates in the same way.

   The Hamas terrorist, in some cases, is less than one mile from where our
   citizens were butchered, beheaded, and cold-heartedly slaughtered. But
   make no mistake, Israel is the West’s frontline in the Middle East —
   Israel is certainly not the end game as far as radical Islam is concerned.
   And Israel’s war against radical Islam is also the West’s war — even if it
   refuses to acknowledge that.

   Israel is grateful to the United States, to its people and the
   administration led by President Joe Biden for unwavering friendship that
   is once again standing up to the test. But the loss of moral clarity and
   compass in some of America’s top university campuses is extremely
   concerning — so too are the pro-Hamas protests in American and European
   cities with participants baying for the destruction of the Jewish state.

   Israel has no choice but to inflict an absolute defeat on Hamas. This war
   comes after six previous military rounds when Israel didn’t utilize its
   full might against Hamas. Since 2007, when Hamas seized control of Gaza,
   Israeli citizens have been subjected time and again to constant rocket,
   missile, and mortar fire on their homes.

   The war being waged by radical Islam against the West and its values is
   only at its start. Al-Qaeda, ISIS and Hamas are the opening chapters in a
   war against the West and its values. In fact, radical Islam already has a
   grip on many European cities.

   It is imperative for the West to learn an important lesson that Israel
   knew in the past and unfortunately forgot in recent times: It is better to
   fight your enemy on their territory rather than wait for them to come to
   you.

   Patience and tolerance towards a radical ideology that doesn’t recognize
   the legitimacy of your way of life is the greatest enemy of peace and
   coexistence. If the Western way of life is important and meaningful, then
   there must be a willingness to stand up and fight for it against its foes.

   Israel’s war against Hamas is crucial to the safety and security of its
   citizens but not only to them. It is also vital to the security of the
   democratic West and to the United States.

 Pope deplores 'desperate humanitarian situation' in Gaza, calls for immediate
                                   ceasefire

   Pope Francis on Monday deplored the desperate humanitarian situation of
   Palestinians in Gaza and called for an immediate ceasefire and the freeing
   of hostages in his Christmas message.

   "My heart grieves for the victims of the abominable attack of 7 October,
   and I reiterate my urgent appeal for the liberation of those still being
   held hostage," the 86-year-old said in his traditional Urbi et Orbi
   message.

   "I plead for an end to the military operations with their appalling
   harvest of innocent civilian victims, and call for a solution to the
   desperate humanitarian situation by an opening to the provision of
   humanitarian aid," he told thousands of faithful gathered in Saint Peter's
   Basilica in the Vatican.

   Nearly three months after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas,
   the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip is catastrophic according to
   the United Nations, with 85 percent of the population displaced.

   The war began on October 7 when Hamas gunmen broke through Gaza's
   militarised border and killed about 1,140 people in Israel, mostly
   civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.

   [ Submit ] 04:22

   Palestinian militants also abducted about 250 people, 129 of whom remain
   in Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.

   Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched a relentless bombardment and
   ground invasion of Gaza, where 20,424 people have been killed, mostly
   women and children, according to the latest toll from the territory's
   Hamas-run health ministry.

   Israel controls access to Gaza and aid has been trickling in from Egypt.
   Last week Israel approved the delivery of aid via its Kerem Shalom
   crossing but it is hugely insufficient to meet the needs in the devastated
   territory.

   The pope also called for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian
   conflict "through sincere and persevering dialogue between the parties,
   sustained by strong political will and the support of the international
   community".

   In his Christmas Eve message late Sunday, the pontiff had called for peace
   in the Holy Land.

   "Tonight, our hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once
   more rejected by the futile logic of war, by the clash of arms that even
   today prevents him from finding room in the world," the pope said.

'Peace for Ukraine'

   The head of 1.3 Catholics in his address also evoked the conflicts in
   Syria, Lebanon and Yemen saying he prayed "that political and social
   stability will soon be attained".

   Francis also said he implored "peace for Ukraine", which is celebrating
   Christmas on December 25 for the first time, snubbing the traditional
   Orthodox date of January 7 feted in Russia.

   "Let us renew our spiritual and human closeness to its embattled people,
   so that through the support of each of us, they may feel the concrete
   reality of God's love," he said.

   The pontiff also urged peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which have
   been locked in a territorial conflict for decades, saying: "May it be
   advanced by the pursuit of humanitarian initiatives, by the return of
   refugees to their homes in legality and security, and by reciprocal
   respect for religious traditions and the places of worship of each
   community".

   Francis also touched on the "conflicts that trouble the region of the
   Sahel, the Horn of Africa and Sudan, as well as Cameroon, the Democratic
   Republic of the Congo and South Sudan".

   He said he hoped tensions on the Korean peninsula would be resolved "by
   undertaking processes of dialogue and reconciliation capable of creating
   the conditions for lasting peace".

   The Argentinian pontiff reserved his last words for the Americas, calling
   on "people of good will" to "devise suitable ways to resolve social and
   political conflicts, to combat forms of poverty that offend the dignity of
   persons, to reduce inequality and to address the troubling phenomenon of
   migration movements".

   Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza
   Strip on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages.

   The Israeli military responded with air strikes on Gaza, and launched a
   ground offensive. More than 20,000 people have been killed in Gaza,
   according to the Hamas-run government.

   During a temporary truce at the end of November, Hamas released 105
   hostages and Israel freed 240 Palestinian prisoners in exchange.

What is the goal of Israel's military operation in Gaza?

   Since the 7 October attacks, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warplanes have
   carried out air strikes across Gaza while its troops have moved through
   the territory.

   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had a "clear goal of
   destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities", as well as
   freeing the hostages.

   Israel, the UK, US and other Western powers class Hamas as a terrorist
   organisation.

   Mr Netanyahu also declared that Israel would have "overall security
   responsibility" for Gaza "for an indefinite period" after the conflict.
   However, he later said Israel had no plans to reoccupy the territory.

   Israel drafted 300,000 reservists for the operation, boosting its standing
   force of 160,000.

What is happening on the ground in Gaza?

   The IDF says it has struck more than 22,000 targets since 7 October.

   It also says it has destroyed more than 800 tunnel shafts built underneath
   Gaza. Hamas previously claimed that its tunnel network stretches for 500km
   (310 miles).

   Satellite images suggest that nearly 100,000 buildings in Gaza may have
   been damaged during the fighting.

   Hamas has continued to fire rockets from Gaza into Israel.

   After the temporary truce ended, Israeli troops pushed into southern Gaza
   and began operations against Hamas and other armed groups in and around
   the city of Khan Younis.

   Israel has also carried out many air strikes on Rafah, near the Egyptian
   border, where it previously told residents of Khan Younis to flee.

   Fierce fighting continues in the north, around the Jabalia refugee camp
   and the eastern Shejaiya district of Gaza City. The UN estimates that
   100,000 civilians remain in the north.

   Israel claims to have killed thousands of Hamas fighters during the war,
   including many commanders.

   The IDF says 134 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the start of the
   ground offensive on 27 October. In total, 466 soldiers have been killed
   since 7 October - most of them during Hamas's attacks that day.

Who are the hostages and how many have been freed?

   During the 7 October attacks, Hamas took about 240 hostages, who it said
   were hidden in "safe places and tunnels" within Gaza.

   Israel said more than 30 of the hostages were children, and at least 10
   were aged over 60. It also said about half of the hostages had foreign
   passports from 25 different countries.

   Under a deal brokered by Qatar, a seven-day pause in fighting began on 24
   November.

   Palestinians released from Israeli jails

   During the truce, 81 Israelis and dual nationals were released, along with
   24 foreigners. In return for the Israeli hostages, 240 Palestinians were
   free from Israeli jails.

   The released hostages included:

     * 78 Israeli women and children
     * 23 Thais and one Filipino
     * 3 Russian-Israelis

   Hamas let four Israeli hostages go before the truce, and another was freed
   by Israeli forces.

   Israeli troops mistakenly shot dead three hostages who were displaying a
   white flag in Gaza on 15 December.

   It is thought about 120 people are still in captivity.

   Hamas has said other armed groups in Gaza are holding hostages, including
   Palestinian Islamic Jihad. This could complicate future releases.

Why did the pause in fighting end, and will another be agreed?

   Each side blamed the other for the collapse of the truce and resumption of
   fighting on 1 December.

   Mr Netanyahu said Hamas had not "met its obligation to release all of the
   women hostages", and had "launched rockets at Israeli citizens".

   Hamas said Israel had refused "to accept all offers to release other
   hostages".

   On 13 December, the UN General Assembly passed a non-binding resolution
   calling for an "immediate humanitarian ceasefire", as well as the "the
   immediate and unconditional release of all hostages".

   Five days earlier, the US had vetoed a similar draft resolution at the UN
   Security Council (UNSC), saying a ceasefire would allow Hamas to regroup.

   A further UNSC vote for a ceasefirehas been repeatedly postponed because
   of disputes over the wording of the resolution.

   Separately, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh has been attending talks in Cairo
   about another possible ceasefire.

   However, on 21 December, Hamas said that all the armed Palestinian groups
   had rejected the prospect of more hostages being released unless Israel
   agreed to end the war in Gaza.

What is the humanitarian situation in Gaza?

   As well as the more than 20,000 people reported killed, the Hamas-run
   health ministry says 52,600 people have been injured since the start of
   the war.

   The World Health Organization (WHO) says only nine out of Gaza's 36
   hospitals are still partially functional, all of them in the south. These
   hospitals are operating at three times their capacity, while facing
   critical shortages of basic supplies and fuel for their generators.

   Mr Netanyahu has admitted that Israel has been "not successful" in
   minimising civilian casualties, but says Hamas has been using Gaza's
   civilians as human shields.

   Food supplies are scarce, and there is overwhelming demand for the limited
   amount of flour distributed by the UN

   Food is scarce in Gaza and prices have soared, meaning many people are
   unable to afford staples such as flour. A lack of power makes cooking
   difficult.

   According to Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, 1.9 million
   Gazan residents - about 85% of the population - have been displaced, and
   1.4 million of them are sheltering in its facilities.

   Many of them fled the fighting in the north after an Israeli order to move
   south of the Wadi Gaza river valley for their own safety.

   Tens of thousands have moved to Rafah to escape the fighting. The UN says
   there are at least 486 people for every toilet in its shelters there.

   Israel's military published an online map with Gaza split into more than
   600 blocks, showing areas where people should evacuate for their own
   safety.

   But Unicef, the UN charity for children, warned that some of the "safe"
   zones were "tiny patches of barren land" with no water, sanitation or
   shelter.

Is humanitarian aid getting into Gaza?

   After the 7 October attacks, Israel shut its border crossings with Gaza,
   preventing the usual supplies of food, water, and medicine from entering
   the territory.

   Israel allowed limited aid deliveries to resume via the
   Egyptian-controlled Rafah border crossing on 21 October. However, the UN
   says the number of lorries entering each day has been about a fifth of the
   daily average of 500 before the war.

   Israel has severely limited supplies of fuel, arguing that it could be
   stolen by Hamas and used for military purposes.

   Fuel shortages have meant that water pumps and desalination plants, waste
   and sanitation services, and many bakeries have been unable to function.

   On 17 December, Israel reopened the Kerem Shalom goods crossing with Gaza,
   allowing another route for aid to enter the territory.

   However, the UN says it is struggling to distribute aid beyond the Rafah
   area. blaming a shortage of lorries, the lack of fuel, frequent
   telecommunications blackouts and the dangers of travelling through areas
   where there is fighting.

   Hundreds of foreign passport holders - including some British and US
   citizens - and seriously wounded and sick Palestinians have been able to
   leave through Rafah, but many remain.

What happened during the Hamas 7 October attacks on Israel?

   On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into
   southern Israel, breaking through the heavily guarded perimeter fence,
   landing by sea, and using paragliders.

   It was the most serious cross-border attack against Israel in more than a
   generation.

   The gunmen killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, in a series
   of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took
   hostages back into Gaza.

   The BBC has also seen and heard evidence of rape, sexual violence and
   mutilation of women during the Hamas attacks, Victims included children,
   teenagers and pensioners.

   The attacks came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions: 2023
   has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the
   Israeli-occupied West Bank.

What is Hamas and what does it want?

   Hamas is a Palestinian group which has run Gaza since 2007.

   The name is an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, which means
   Islamic Resistance Movement.

   The group wants to destroy Israel and replace it with an Islamic state.

   Image caption,

   Its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, is thought to have
   about 30,000 members.

   Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power, firing
   thousands of rockets into Israel and carrying out other deadly attacks.

   In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes,
   sending in troops in 2008 and 2014.

   Hamas - or in some cases the al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a
   terrorist group by Israel, the US, the EU and the UK, as well as other
   powers.

   Iran backs the group, providing funding, weapons and training.

Where is the Gaza Strip and how big is it?

   The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located
   between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.

   Map showing Israel and the Palestinian Territories and surrounding
   countries

   Previously occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967
   Six-Day War.

   Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in
   2005.

   Home to 2.2 million people, the narrow strip is one of the most
   densely-populated areas in the world.

   Just over three-quarters of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people -
   are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN.

   Before the latest conflict, more than 500,000 people lived in eight
   refugee camps located across the Strip.

   Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and strictly
   limits the movement of people and goods.

What is Palestine?

   The West Bank and Gaza are known as the Palestinian territories. Along
   with East Jerusalem and Israel, they formed part of a land known as
   Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.

   In 1948, part of Palestine became Israel, which was recognised by the
   United Nations the following year. The West Bank (including East
   Jerusalem) and Gaza are recognised as Palestine by many countries and
   bodies, although it does not have member status at the UN.

   Those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist also still refer to all
   of the land as Palestine.

   The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is
   based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation.

   He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and
   represents the Fatah political party - a bitter rival of Hamas.

   The injured were taken to Al-Aqsa Hospital, Deir al-Balah, in the central
   Gaza Strip

   By Shaimaa Khalil in Jerusalem and Youssef Taha in London
   BBC News

   Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says an Israeli air strike killed at
   least 70 people in the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in the centre of the strip.

   A spokesman said the death toll was likely to rise given the large number
   of families living in the area.

   The Israeli military told the BBC it was looking into reports of the
   strike.

   It comes as Israeli and Arab media say Egypt, which borders the Gaza
   Strip, has put forward a new proposal for a ceasefire between Israel and
   Hamas.

   Dozens of injured people were rushed from Maghazi to nearby Al-Aqsa
   Hospital with footage showing some children's faces covered in blood and
   body bags piled outside.

   The health ministry says three houses were hit in the attack late on
   Sunday.

   According to ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra, a densely populated
   residential block was destroyed.

   A father said he had lost his daughter and grandchildren, adding that his
   family had fled from the north for safety in central Gaza.

   "They lived on the third floor of one of the buildings," he said. "The
   wall collapsed on them. My grandchildren, my daughter, her husband - all
   gone.

   "We are all targeted. Civilians are targeted. There is no safe place. They
   told us to leave Gaza City - now we came to central Gaza to die."

   The Palestine Red Crescent Society says "intense" Israeli air strikes have
   led to the closure of main roads between Maghazi and two other refugee
   camps, Al-Bureij and Al-Nuseirat, "hindering the work of ambulances and
   rescue teams".

   In a statement to the BBC, the Israeli military said it had received
   "reports of an incident in the Maghazi camp".

   "Despite the challenges posed by Hamas terrorists operating within
   civilian areas in Gaza, the IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] is committed to
   international law including taking feasible steps to minimize harm to
   civilians," it added.

   According to the health ministry, more than 20,000 people have been killed
   - mostly children and women - and 54,000 injured in Gaza since 7 October,
   when Hamas and other Palestinian groups attacked Israel, killing 1,200
   people and taking about 240 hostages.

     * What Gaza's death toll says about the war
     * Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza?

   Earlier on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war
   had come at a "very heavy price" for his country.

   The Israeli military said more than a dozen soldiers had been killed in
   Gaza since Friday, bringing the total for the ground offensive launched
   after 7 October to 156.

   Saturday was one of its deadliest days but Mr Netanyahu said there was "no
   choice" but to keep fighting.

   The new ceasefire proposal by Egypt would be implemented in three parts:

     * The first phase of the ceasefire would see a humanitarian pause of
       seven to ten days during which Hamas would release all civilian
       hostages in exchange for some Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails
     * In the week-long second phase, Hamas would release all Israeli female
       soldiers in return for more prisoners and the exchange of corpses held
       since 7 October
     * The third phase, which would last a month, would see the release of
       the remaining hostages and a number of Palestinian prisoners and
       Israel withdrawing from the Gaza Strip and suspension of all aerial
       activities.

   Indirect negotiations would be held in Egypt with Qatari and US
   participation.

   An Israeli source told Maariv newspaper that the Egyptian initiative could
   lead to negotiations. Hamas says it is studying the proposal.

   Meanwhile, the Danish shipping giant, Maersk, says it is preparing to
   resume shipping operations through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.

   The announcement came after an international military operation, led by
   the US, was deployed to prevent the targeting of commercial ships by
   drones from areas of Yemen controlled by Houthi rebels. The Houthis have
   declared their support for Hamas and have said they would target any ship
   travelling to Israel.

   Maersk and other shipping companies stopped sending ships through the Red
   Sea and the Suez Canal earlier this month as a result of drone attacks. US
   Central Command said two days ago that a US navy destroyer had shot down
   four drones in the Red Sea launched from Yemeni territory.

   In another development, Pope Francis appealed for peace in the Middle East
   as he presided over a Christmas Eve Mass at Saint Peter's Basilica in the
   Vatican.

   Referring to the war between Israel and Hamas, the Pope said Jesus's
   message of peace was being drowned out by the "futile logic of war" in the
   very land where he had been born.
