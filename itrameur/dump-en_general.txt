   War is an intense armed conflict^[a] between states, governments,
   societies, or paramilitary groups such as mercenaries, insurgents, and
   militias. It is generally characterized by extreme violence, destruction,
   and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. Warfare refers
   to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars
   in general.^[2] Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely
   legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other
   non-combatant suffering and casualties.

   While some war studies scholars consider war a universal and ancestral
   aspect of human nature,^[3] others argue it is a result of specific
   socio-cultural, economic, or ecological circumstances.^[4]

Etymology

   [IMG]Mural of War (1896), by Gari Melchers

   The English word war derives from the 11th-century Old English words wyrre
   and werre, from Old French werre (also guerre as in modern French), in
   turn from the Frankish *werra, ultimately deriving from the Proto-Germanic
   *werzō 'mixture, confusion'. The word is related to the Old Saxon werran,
   Old High German werran, and the modern German verwirren, meaning 'to
   confuse, to perplex, to bring into confusion'.^[5]

   archeologist) [IMG]The Egyptian siege of Dapur in the 13th century BCE,
   from Ramesseum, Thebes.

   The earliest evidence of prehistoric warfare is a Mesolithic cemetery in
   Jebel Sahaba, which has been determined to be about 13,400 years old.^[6]
   About forty-five percent of the skeletons there displayed signs of violent
   death, specifically traumatic bone lesions.^[7]

   Since the rise of the state some 5,000 years ago,^[8] military activity
   has occurred over much of the globe. Estimates for total deaths due to war
   vary wildly. For the period 3000 BCE until 1991, estimates range from
   145 million to 2 billion.^[9] In one estimate, primitive warfare prior to
   3000 BCE has been thought to have claimed 400 million victims based on the
   assumption that it accounted for the 15.1% of all deaths.^[10] For
   comparison, an estimated 1,680,000,000 people died from infectious
   diseases in the 20th century.^[11]

   In War Before Civilization, Lawrence H. Keeley, a professor at the
   University of Illinois, says approximately 90–95% of known societies
   throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare,^[12] and many
   fought constantly.^[13]

   Keeley describes several styles of primitive combat such as small raids,
   large raids, and massacres. All of these forms of warfare were used by
   primitive societies, a finding supported by other researchers.^[14] Keeley
   explains that early war raids were not well organized, as the participants
   did not have any formal training. Scarcity of resources meant defensive
   works were not a cost-effective way to protect the society against enemy
   raids.^[15]

   William Rubinstein wrote "Pre-literate societies, even those organized in
   a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty.'"^[16]
   The invention of gunpowder, and its eventual use in warfare, together with
   the acceleration of technological advances have fomented major changes to
   war itself.

   In Western Europe, since the late 18th century, more than 150 conflicts
   and about 600 battles have taken place.^[17] During the 20th century, war
   resulted in a dramatic intensification of the pace of social changes, and
   was a crucial catalyst for the growth of left-wing politics.^[18]

   In 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of
   modern warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences and
   costs of the newly developed atom bomb, Albert Einstein famously stated,
   "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War
   IV will be fought with sticks and stones."^[19]

   Mao Zedong urged the socialist camp not to fear nuclear war with the
   United States since, even if "half of mankind died, the other half would
   remain while imperialism would be razed to the ground and the whole world
   would become socialist."^[20]

   A distinctive feature of war since 1945 is that combat has largely been a
   matter of civil wars and insurgencies.^[21] The major exceptions were the
   Korean War, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Iran–Iraq War, the Gulf
   War, the Eritrean–Ethiopian War, and the Russo-Ukrainian War.

   The Human Security Report 2005 documented a significant decline in the
   number and severity of armed conflicts since the end of the Cold War in
   the early 1990s. However, the evidence examined in the 2008 edition of the
   Center for International Development and Conflict Management's "Peace and
   Conflict" study indicated the overall decline in conflicts had
   stalled.^[22]

Types of warfare

   Main article: Types of war
     * Asymmetric warfare is the methods used in conflicts between
       belligerents of drastically different levels of military capability or
       size.^[23]
     * Biological warfare, or germ warfare, is the use of biological
       infectious agents or toxins such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi
       against people, plants, or animals. This can be conducted through
       sophisticated technologies, like cluster munitions,^[24] or with
       rudimentary techniques like catapulting an infected corpse behind
       enemy lines,^[25] and can include weaponized or non-weaponized
       pathogens.
     * Chemical warfare involves the use of weaponized chemicals in combat.
       Poison gas as a chemical weapon was principally used during World War
       I, and resulted in over a million estimated casualties, including more
       than 100,000 civilians.^[26]
     * Cold warfare is an intense international rivalry without direct
       military conflict, but with a sustained threat of it, including high
       levels of military preparations, expenditures, and development, and
       may involve active conflicts by indirect means, such as economic
       warfare, political warfare, covert operations, espionage,
       cyberwarfare, or proxy wars.
     * Conventional warfare is a form of warfare between states in which
       nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons are not used or see limited
       deployment.
     * Cyberwarfare involves the actions by a nation-state or international
       organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's
       information systems.
     * Insurgency is a rebellion against authority, when those taking part in
       the rebellion are not recognized as belligerents (lawful combatants).
       An insurgency can be fought via counterinsurgency, and may also be
       opposed by measures to protect the population, and by political and
       economic actions of various kinds aimed at undermining the insurgents'
       claims against the incumbent regime.
     * Information warfare is the application of destructive force on a large
       scale against information assets and systems, against the computers
       and networks that support the four critical infrastructures (the power
       grid, communications, financial, and transportation).^[27]
     * Nuclear warfare is warfare in which nuclear weapons are the primary,
       or a major, method of achieving capitulation.
     * Total war is warfare by any means possible, disregarding the laws of
       war, placing no limits on legitimate military targets, using weapons
       and tactics resulting in significant civilian casualties, or demanding
       a war effort requiring significant sacrifices by the friendly civilian
       population.
     * Unconventional warfare, the opposite of conventional warfare, is an
       attempt to achieve military victory through acquiescence,
       capitulation, or clandestine support for one side of an existing
       conflict.

Aims

   [IMG]United States Army soldiers engaged in a firefight with Taliban
   insurgents during the War in Afghanistan, 2009

   Entities contemplating going to war and entities considering whether to
   end a war may formulate war aims as an evaluation/propaganda tool. War
   aims may stand as a proxy for national-military resolve.^[28]

  Definition

   Fried defines war aims as "the desired territorial, economic, military or
   other benefits expected following successful conclusion of a war".^[29]

  Classification

   Tangible/intangible aims:

     * Tangible war aims may involve (for example) the acquisition of
       territory (as in the German goal of Lebensraum in the first half of
       the 20th century) or the recognition of economic concessions (as in
       the Anglo-Dutch Wars).
     * Intangible war aims – like the accumulation of credibility or
       reputation^[30] – may have more tangible expression ("conquest
       restores prestige, annexation increases power").^[31]

   Explicit/implicit aims:

     * Explicit war aims may involve published policy decisions.
     * Implicit war aims^[32] can take the form of minutes of discussion,
       memoranda and instructions.^[33]

   Positive/negative aims:

     * "Positive war aims" cover tangible outcomes.
     * "Negative war aims" forestall or prevent undesired outcomes.^[34]

   War aims can change in the course of conflict and may eventually morph
   into "peace conditions"^[35] – the minimal conditions under which a state
   may cease to wage a particular war.

   Throughout the course of human history, the average number of people dying
   from war has fluctuated relatively little, being about 1 to 10 people
   dying per 100,000. However, major wars over shorter periods have resulted
   in much higher casualty rates, with 100–200 casualties per 100,000 over a
   few years. While conventional wisdom holds that casualties have increased
   in recent times due to technological improvements in warfare, this is not
   generally true. For instance, the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) had about
   the same number of casualties per capita as World War I, although it was
   higher during World War II (WWII). That said, overall the number of
   casualties from war has not significantly increased in recent times. Quite
   to the contrary, on a global scale the time since WWII has been unusually
   peaceful.^[38]

  Largest by death toll

   Main articles: List of wars by death toll, Outline of war § Wars, and
   Casualty recording

   The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths
   since its start, is World War II, from 1939 to 1945, with 70–85 million
   deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests^[39] at up to 60 million. As
   concerns a belligerent's losses in proportion to its prewar population,
   the most destructive war in modern history may have been the Paraguayan
   War (see Paraguayan War casualties). In 2013 war resulted in 31,000
   deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990.^[40] War usually results in
   significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease
   in social spending, famine, large-scale emigration from the war zone, and
   often the mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilians.^[41]^[42]^[43]
   For instance, of the nine million people who were on the territory of the
   Byelorussian SSR in 1941, some 1.6 million were killed by the Germans in
   actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war,
   500,000 Jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority
   of whom were unarmed civilians).^[44] Another byproduct of some wars is
   the prevalence of propaganda by some or all parties in the conflict,^[45]
   and increased revenues by weapons manufacturers.^[46]

   Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been
   waged in the last century. These are the two World Wars, followed by the
   Second Sino-Japanese War (which is sometimes considered part of World War
   II, or as overlapping). Most of the others involved China or neighboring
   peoples. The death toll of World War II, being over 60 million, surpasses
   all other war-death-tolls.^[47]

  On military personnel

   Military personnel subject to combat in war often suffer mental and
   physical injuries, including depression, posttraumatic stress disorder,
   disease, injury, and death.

     In every war in which American soldiers have fought in, the chances of
     becoming a psychiatric casualty – of being debilitated for some period
     of time as a consequence of the stresses of military life – were greater
     than the chances of being killed by enemy fire.

     — No More Heroes, Richard Gabriel^[17]

   Swank and Marchand's World War II study found that after sixty days of
   continuous combat, 98% of all surviving military personnel will become
   psychiatric casualties. Psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in
   fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety,
   obsessional and compulsive states, and character disorders.^[60]

     One-tenth of mobilised American men were hospitalised for mental
     disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and after thirty-five days of
     uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in
     varying degrees.

     Becker^[17]

   [IMG]The Apotheosis of War (1871) by Vasily Vereshchagin

   Additionally, it has been estimated anywhere from 18% to 54% of Vietnam
   war veterans suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder.^[60]

   Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white American males aged 13 to 43
   died in the American Civil War, including about 6% in the North and
   approximately 18% in the South.^[61] The war remains the deadliest
   conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000 military
   personnel. United States military casualties of war since 1775 have
   totaled over two million. Of the 60 million European military personnel
   who were mobilized in World War I, 8 million were killed, 7 million were
   permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured.^[62]

   [IMG]The remains of dead Crow Indians killed and scalped by Sioux c. 1874

   During Napoleon's retreat from Moscow, more French military personnel died
   of typhus than were killed by the Russians.^[63] Of the 450,000 soldiers
   who crossed the Neman on 25 June 1812, less than 40,000 returned. More
   military personnel were killed from 1500 to 1914 by typhus than from
   military action.^[64] In addition, if it were not for modern medical
   advances there would be thousands more dead from disease and infection.
   For instance, during the Seven Years' War, the Royal Navy reported it
   conscripted 184,899 sailors, of whom 133,708 (72%) died of disease or were
   'missing'.^[65]

   It is estimated that between 1985 and 1994, 378,000 people per year died
   due to war.^[66]

  On civilians

   See also: Civilian casualties
   [IMG]Les Grandes Misères de la guerre depict the destruction unleashed on
   civilians during the Thirty Years' War.

   Most wars have resulted in significant loss of life, along with
   destruction of infrastructure and resources (which may lead to famine,
   disease, and death in the civilian population). During the Thirty Years'
   War in Europe, the population of the Holy Roman Empire was reduced by 15
   to 40 percent.^[67]^[68] Civilians in war zones may also be subject to war
   atrocities such as genocide, while survivors may suffer the psychological
   aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war. War also results in
   lower quality of life and worse health outcomes. A medium-sized conflict
   with about 2,500 battle deaths reduces civilian life expectancy by one
   year and increases infant mortality by 10% and malnutrition by 3.3%.
   Additionally, about 1.8% of the population loses access to drinking
   water.^[69]

   Most estimates of World War II casualties indicate around 60 million
   people died, 40 million of whom were civilians.^[70] Deaths in the Soviet
   Union were around 27 million.^[71] Since a high proportion of those killed
   were young men who had not yet fathered any children, population growth in
   the postwar Soviet Union was much lower than it otherwise would have
   been.^[72]

  Economic

   See also: Military Keynesianism

   Once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay war
   reparations to the victorious nations. In certain cases, land is ceded to
   the victorious nations. For example, the territory of Alsace-Lorraine has
   been traded between France and Germany on three different occasions.^[73]

   Typically, war becomes intertwined with the economy and many wars are
   partially or entirely based on economic reasons. Following World War II,
   consensus opinion for many years amongst economists and historians was
   that war can stimulate a country's economy as evidenced by the U.S's
   emergence from the Great Depression,^[74] though modern economic analysis
   has thrown significant doubt on these views. In most cases, such as the
   wars of Louis XIV, the Franco-Prussian War, and World War I, warfare
   primarily results in damage to the economy of the countries involved. For
   example, Russia's involvement in World War I took such a toll on the
   Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the
   start of the Russian Revolution of 1917.^[75]

    World War II

   [IMG]Ruins of Warsaw's Napoleon Square in the aftermath of World War II

   World War II was the most financially costly conflict in history; its
   belligerents cumulatively spent about a trillion U.S. dollars on the war
   effort (as adjusted to 1940 prices).^[76]^[77] The Great Depression of the
   1930s ended as nations increased their production of war materials.^[78]

   By the end of the war, 70% of European industrial infrastructure was
   destroyed.^[79] Property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the Axis
   invasion was estimated at a value of 679 billion rubles. The combined
   damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and
   towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial
   establishments, 40,000 mi (64,374 km) of railroad, 4100 railroad stations,
   40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries.^[80]

Theories of motivation

   See also: International relations theory
   [IMG]The Ottoman campaign for territorial expansion in Europe in 1566

   There are many theories about the motivations for war, but no consensus
   about which are most common.^[81] Military theorist Carl von Clausewitz
   said, "Every age has its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and
   its own peculiar preconceptions."^[82]

  Psychoanalytic

   Dutch psychoanalyst Joost Meerloo held that, "War is often...a mass
   discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of
   mankind are discharged in mass destruction."^[83]

   Other psychoanalysts such as E.F.M. Durban and John Bowlby have argued
   human beings are inherently violent.^[84] This aggressiveness is fueled by
   displacement and projection where a person transfers his or her grievances
   into bias and hatred against other races, religions, nations or
   ideologies. By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local
   society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare.

   The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of Melanie Klein,
   thought war was the paranoid or projective "elaboration" of mourning.^[85]
   Fornari thought war and violence develop out of our "love need": our wish
   to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely
   our early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the
   sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as
   the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for
   their country, to give over their bodies to their nation.

   Despite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for self-sacrifice
   for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, few wars have
   originated from a desire for war among the general populace.^[86] Far more
   often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its
   rulers. One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by
   Maurice Walsh.^[87] He argues the general populace is more neutral towards
   war and wars occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard
   for human life are placed into power. War is caused by leaders who seek
   war such as Napoleon and Hitler. Such leaders most often come to power in
   times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then
   leads the nation to war.

     Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in
     England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is
     understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who
     determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people
     along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a
     Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. ... the people can always be
     brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do
     is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack
     of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way
     in any country.

     — Hermann Göring at the Nuremberg trials, 18 April 1946^[88]

  Evolutionary

   See also: Prehistoric warfare
   [IMG]Women and priests retrieve the dead bodies of Swabian soldiers just

   (Luzerner Schilling)

   Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are
   two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging in or after the
   Mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater
   population density and competition over resources; the other sees human
   warfare as a more ancient practice derived from common animal tendencies,
   such as territoriality and sexual competition.^[89]

   The latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found in
   many primate species such as chimpanzees,^[90] as well as in many ant
   species,^[91] group conflict may be a general feature of animal social
   behavior. Some proponents of the idea argue that war, while innate, has
   been intensified greatly by developments of technology and social
   organization such as weaponry and states.^[92]

   Psychologist and linguist Steven Pinker argued that war-related behaviors
   may have been naturally selected in the ancestral environment due to the
   benefits of victory.^[b] He also argued that in order to have credible
   deterrence against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it
   was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to
   develop instincts for revenge as well as for protecting a group's (or an
   individual's) reputation ("honor").^[b]

   [IMG]Increasing population and constant warfare among the Maya city-states
   over resources may have contributed to the eventual collapse of the Maya
   civilization by 900 CE.

   Crofoot and Wrangham have argued that warfare, if defined as group
   interactions in which "coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill
   members of other groups", is a characteristic of most human societies.
   Those in which it has been lacking "tend to be societies that were
   politically dominated by their neighbors".^[94]

   Ashley Montagu strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments,
   arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in
   determining the nature and presence of warfare. Thus, he argues, warfare
   is not a universal human occurrence and appears to have been a historical
   invention, associated with certain types of human societies.^[95]
   Montagu's argument is supported by ethnographic research conducted in
   societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent,
   e.g. the Chewong and Semai of the Malay peninsula.^[96] Bobbi S. Low has
   observed correlation between warfare and education, noting societies where
   warfare is commonplace encourage their children to be more
   aggressive.^[97]

  Economic

   [IMG]Kuwaiti oil wells on fire during the Gulf War, 1 March 1991
   See also: Resource war

   War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive
   international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for
   natural resources and for wealth. War has also been linked to economic
   development by economic historians and development economists studying
   state-building and fiscal capacity.^[98] While this theory has been
   applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the
   increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of
   wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute,
   wealth differences that may fuel wars. There are those on the extreme
   right of the political spectrum who provide support, fascists in
   particular, by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever
   the weak cannot hold by force.^[99]^[100] Some centrist, capitalist, world
   leaders, including Presidents of the United States and U.S. Generals,
   expressed support for an economic view of war.

  Marxist

   Main article: Marxist explanations of warfare

   The Marxist theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states all modern
   wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great
   (imperialist) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of
   capitalism. Marxist economists Karl Kautsky, Rosa Luxemburg, Rudolf
   Hilferding and Vladimir Lenin theorized that imperialism was the result of
   capitalist countries needing new markets. Expansion of the means of
   production is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in consumer
   demand. Since the workers in a capitalist economy would be unable to fill
   the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find
   consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism.^[101]

  Demographic

   Demographic theories can be grouped into two classes, Malthusian and youth
   bulge theories:

    Malthusian

   [IMG]A U.S. Marine Corps helicopter on patrol in Somalia as part of the
   Unified Task Force, 1992

   Malthusian theories see expanding population and scarce resources as a
   source of violent conflict.

   Pope Urban II in 1095, on the eve of the First Crusade, advocating Crusade
   as a solution to European overpopulation, said:

     For this land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea and
     the mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population; it scarcely
     furnishes food enough for its cultivators. Hence it is that you murder
     and devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many among you
     perish in civil strife. Let hatred, therefore, depart from among you;
     let your quarrels end. Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepulchre; wrest
     that land from a wicked race, and subject it to yourselves.^[102]

   This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the
   Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding
   populations and limited resources. Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) wrote that
   populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or
   famine.^[103]

   The violent herder–farmer conflicts in Nigeria, Mali, Sudan and other
   countries in the Sahel region have been exacerbated by land degradation
   and population growth.^[104]^[105]^[106]

    Youth bulge

   [IMG]Median age by country. War reduces life expectancy. A youth bulge is
   evident for Africa, and to a lesser extent in some countries in West Asia,
   South Asia, Southeast Asia and Central America.

   According to Heinsohn, who proposed youth bulge theory in its most
   generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males
   of a nation belong to the "fighting age" cohorts from 15 to 29 years of
   age. It will follow periods with total fertility rates as high as 4–8
   children per woman with a 15–29-year delay.^[107]^[108]

   Heinsohn saw both past "Christianist" European colonialism and
   imperialism, as well as today's Islamist civil unrest and terrorism as
   results of high birth rates producing youth bulges.^[109] Among prominent
   historical events that have been attributed to youth bulges are the role
   played by the historically large youth cohorts in the rebellion and
   revolution waves of early modern Europe, including the French Revolution
   of 1789,^[110] and the effect of economic depression upon the largest
   German youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of Nazism in Germany in
   the 1930s.^[111] The 1994 Rwandan genocide has also been analyzed as
   following a massive youth bulge.^[112]

   Youth bulge theory has been subjected to statistical analysis by the World
   Bank,^[113] Population Action International,^[114] and the Berlin
   Institute for Population and Development.^[115] Youth bulge theories have
   been criticized as leading to racial, gender and age discrimination.^[116]

  Cultural

   Geoffrey Parker argues that what distinguishes the "Western way of war"
   based in Western Europe chiefly allows historians to explain its
   extraordinary success in conquering most of the world after 1500:

     The Western way of war rests upon five principal foundations:
     technology, discipline, a highly aggressive military tradition, a
     remarkable capacity to innovate and to respond rapidly to the innovation
     of others and – from about 1500 onward – a unique system of war finance.
     The combination of all five provided a formula for military
     success....The outcome of wars has been determined less by technology,
     then by better war plans, the achievement of surprise, greater economic
     strength, and above all superior discipline.^[117]

   Parker argues that Western armies were stronger because they emphasized
   discipline, that is, "the ability of a formation to stand fast in the face
   of the enemy, where they're attacking or being attacked, without giving
   way to the natural impulse of fear and panic." Discipline came from drills
   and marching in formation, target practice, and creating small "artificial
   kinship groups: such as the company and the platoon, to enhance
   psychological cohesion and combat efficiency.^[118]

  Rationalist

   [IMG]U.S. Marines directing a concentration of fire at their opponents
   during the Vietnam War, 8 May 1968

   Rationalism is an international relations theory or framework. Rationalism
   (and Neorealism (international relations)) operate under the assumption
   that states or international actors are rational, seek the best possible
   outcomes for themselves, and desire to avoid the costs of war.^[119] Under
   one game theory approach, rationalist theories posit all actors can
   bargain, would be better off if war did not occur, and likewise seek to
   understand why war nonetheless reoccurs. Under another rationalist game
   theory without bargaining, the peace war game, optimal strategies can
   still be found that depend upon number of iterations played. In
   "Rationalist Explanations for War", James Fearon examined three
   rationalist explanations for why some countries engage in war:

     * Issue indivisibilities
     * Incentives to misrepresent or information asymmetry
     * Commitment problems^[119]

   "Issue indivisibility" occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by
   bargaining, because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be
   shared between them, but only owned entirely by one side or the other.

   "Information asymmetry with incentives to misrepresent" occurs when two
   countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not
   agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of
   state's victory or loss. For instance, Geoffrey Blainey argues that war is
   a result of miscalculation of strength. He cites historical examples of
   war and demonstrates, "war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic crisis
   which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting estimates of
   their bargaining power."^[120] Thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the
   states' inability to make credible commitments.^[121]

   Within the rationalist tradition, some theorists have suggested that
   individuals engaged in war suffer a normal level of cognitive bias,^[122]
   but are still "as rational as you and me".^[123] According to philosopher
   Iain King, "Most instigators of conflict overrate their chances of
   success, while most participants underrate their chances of
   injury...."^[124] King asserts that "Most catastrophic military decisions
   are rooted in groupthink" which is faulty, but still rational.^[125]

   The rationalist theory focused around bargaining is currently under
   debate. The Iraq War proved to be an anomaly that undercuts the validity
   of applying rationalist theory to some wars.^[126]

  Political science

   The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by Lewis Fry Richardson
   following World War I. More recent databases of wars and armed conflict
   have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project, Peter Brecke and the
   Uppsala Conflict Data Program.^[127]

   The following subsections consider causes of war from system, societal,
   and individual levels of analysis. This kind of division was first
   proposed by Kenneth Waltz in Man, the State, and War and has been often
   used by political scientists since then.^[128]^: 143 

    System-level

   There are several different international relations theory schools.
   Supporters of realism in international relations argue that the motivation
   of states is the quest for security, and conflicts can arise from the
   inability to distinguish defense from offense, which is called the
   security dilemma.^[128]^: 145 

   Within the realist school as represented by scholars such as Henry
   Kissinger and Hans Morgenthau, and the neorealist school represented by
   scholars such as Kenneth Waltz and John Mearsheimer, two main sub-theories
   are:

    1. Balance of power theory: States have the goal of preventing a single
       state from becoming a hegemon, and war is the result of the would-be
       hegemon's persistent attempts at power acquisition. In this view, an
       international system with more equal distribution of power is more
       stable, and "movements toward unipolarity are
       destabilizing."^[128]^: 147  However, evidence has shown power
       polarity is not actually a major factor in the occurrence of
       wars.^[128]^: 147–48 
    2. Power transition theory: Hegemons impose stabilizing conditions on the
       world order, but they eventually decline, and war occurs when a
       declining hegemon is challenged by another rising power or aims to
       preemptively suppress them.^[128]^: 148  On this view, unlike for
       balance-of-power theory, wars become more probable when power is more
       equally distributed. This "power preponderance" hypothesis has
       empirical support.^[128]^: 148 

   The two theories are not mutually exclusive and may be used to explain
   disparate events according to the circumstance.^[128]^: 148 

   Liberalism as it relates to international relations emphasizes factors
   such as trade, and its role in disincentivizing conflict which will damage
   economic relations. Realists^[who?] respond that military force may
   sometimes be at least as effective as trade at achieving economic
   benefits, especially historically if not as much today.^[128]^: 149 
   Furthermore, trade relations which result in a high level of dependency
   may escalate tensions and lead to conflict.^[128]^: 150  Empirical data on
   the relationship of trade to peace are mixed, and moreover, some evidence
   suggests countries at war do not necessarily trade less with each
   other.^[128]^: 150 

    Societal-level

     * Diversionary theory, also known as the "scapegoat hypothesis",
       suggests the politically powerful may use war to as a diversion or to
       rally domestic popular support.^[128]^: 152  This is supported by
       literature showing out-group hostility enhances in-group bonding, and
       a significant domestic "rally effect" has been demonstrated when
       conflicts begin.^[128]^: 152–13  However, studies examining the
       increased use of force as a function of need for internal political
       support are more mixed.^[128]^: 152–53  U.S. war-time presidential
       popularity surveys taken during the presidencies of several recent
       U.S. leaders have supported diversionary theory.^[129]

    Individual-level

   These theories suggest differences in people's personalities,
   decision-making, emotions, belief systems, and biases are important in
   determining whether conflicts get out of hand.^[128]^: 157  For instance,
   it has been proposed that conflict is modulated by bounded rationality and
   various cognitive biases,^[128]^: 157  such as prospect theory.^[130]

Ethics

   [IMG]Morning after the Battle of Waterloo, by John Heaviside Clark, 1816

   The morality of war has been the subject of debate for thousands of
   years.^[131]

   The two principal aspects of ethics in war, according to the just war
   theory, are jus ad bellum and jus in bello.^[132]

   Jus ad bellum (right to war), dictates which unfriendly acts and
   circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another
   nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war:
   first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it
   must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit
   large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful
   intentions – namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil;
   fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success;
   fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought
   must be proportional to means being used.^[133]^[134]

   [IMG]In besieged Leningrad. "Hitler ordered that Moscow and Leningrad were
   to be razed to the ground; their inhabitants were to be annihilated or
   driven out by starvation. These intentions were part of the 'General Plan
   East'." – The Oxford Companion to World War II.^[135]

   Jus in bello (right in war), is the set of ethical rules when conducting
   war. The two main principles are proportionality and discrimination.
   Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally
   appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered.^[136] The
   principle of discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a
   war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is
   permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not.^[136] Failure to
   follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the
   just-war-belligerent.^[137]

   The just war theory was foundational in the creation of the United Nations
   and in international law's regulations on legitimate war.^[131]

   Lewis Coser, an American conflict theorist and sociologist, argued
   conflict provides a function and a process whereby a succession of new
   equilibriums are created. Thus, the struggle of opposing forces, rather
   than being disruptive, may be a means of balancing and maintaining a
   social structure or society.^[138]

Limiting and stopping

   [IMG]Anti-war rally in Washington, D.C., 15 March 2003
   Main article: Anti-war movement

   Religious groups have long formally opposed or sought to limit war as in
   the Second Vatican Council document Gaudiem et Spes: "Any act of war aimed
   indiscriminately at the destruction of entire cities of extensive areas
   along with their population is a crime against God and man himself. It
   merits unequivocal and unhesitating condemnation."^[139]

   Anti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century,
   including, most prominently, World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam
   War. In the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred in
   response to the United States invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. Protests
   opposing the War in Afghanistan occurred in Europe, Asia, and the United
   States.

Pauses

   During a war, brief pauses of violence may be called for, and further
   agreed to – ceasefire, temporary cessation, humanitarian pauses and
   corridors, days of tranquility, de-confliction arrangements.^[140] There
   are a number of disadvantages, obstacles and hesitations against
   implementing such pauses such as a humanitarian corridor.^[141]^[142]
   Pauses in conflict can also be ill-advised, for reasons such as "delay of
   defeat" and the "weakening of credibility".^[143] Natural causes for a
   pause may include events such as the 2019 coronavirus
   pandemic.^[144]^[145]

Notes

    1. ^ The term "armed conflict" is used instead of, or in addition to, the
       term "war" with the former being more general in scope. The
       International Committee of the Red Cross differentiates between
       international and non-international armed conflict in their
       definition, "International armed conflicts exist whenever there is
       resort to armed force between two or more States.... Non-international
       armed conflicts are protracted armed confrontations occurring between
       governmental armed forces and the forces of one or more armed groups,
       or between such groups arising on the territory of a State [party to
       the Geneva Conventions]. The armed confrontation must reach a minimum
       level of intensity and the parties involved in the conflict must show
       a minimum of organisation."^[1]
    2. ^ ^a ^b The argument is made from pages 314 to 332 of The Blank
       Slate.^[93] Relevant quotes include on p332 "The first step in
       understanding violence is to set aside our abhorrence of it long
       enough to examine why it can sometimes pay off in evolutionary
       terms.", "Natural selection is powered by competition, which means
       that the products of natural selection – survival machines, in Richard
       Dawkins metaphor – should, by default, do whatever helps them survive
       and reproduce.". On p323 "If an obstacle stands in the way of
       something an organism needs, it should neutralize the obstacle by
       disabling or eliminating it.", "Another human obstacle consists of men
       monopolozing women who could otherwise be taken as wives.", "The
       competition can be violent". On p324 "So people have invented, and
       perhaps evolved, an alternate defense: the advertised deterrence
       policy known as lex talionis, the law of retaliation, familiar from
       the biblical injunction "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." If
       you can credibly say to potential adversaries, "We won't attack first,
       but if we are attacked, we will survive and strike back," you removee
       Hobbes's first two incentives for quarrel, gain and mistrust.". On
       p326 "Also necessary for vengeance to work as a deterrent is that the
       willingness to pursue it be made public, because the whole point of
       deterrence is to give would-be attackers second thoughts beforehand.
       And this brings us to Hobbes's final reason for quarrel. Thirdly,
       glory – though a more accurate word would be "honor"."

   War is generally defined as violent conflict between states or nations.

   Nations go to war for a variety of reasons. It has been argued that a
   nation will go to war if the benefits of war are deemed to outweigh the
   disadvantages, and if there is a sense that there is not another mutually
   agreeable solution. More specifically, some have argued that wars are
   fought primarily for economic, religious, and political reasons. Others
   have claimed that most wars today are fought for ideological reasons.

   In the United States, the legal power to declare war is vested in
   Congress; however, the president is the commander-in-chief of the
   military, so he or she holds power to conduct a war once it has been
   declared. In many instances, the president has used military force without
   declaring war.

   Just War Theory

   In Western tradition, there is a sense that the reasons for war must be
   just. This idea dates back to ancient times, but is most clearly traced to
   the writings of St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas. They attempted to
   justify war, and reconcile it with the Christian belief that taking a
   human life is wrong.

   To Aquinas, a war must be just in both the reasons for going to war and
   how war is fought. Reasons for going to war—jus ad bellum—are just if (1)
   war is declared by an appropriate authority; (2) the war is waged for a
   just cause; and (3) the war is waged for just intentions. An appropriate
   authority is a proper, governing authority. A “just cause” may include
   self-defense or a response to injustice. “Just intentions” mean that it
   must not be fought for self-interest, but for justice or a common good. In
   addition, (4) there must be a reasonable chance of success; (5) the good
   that will be achieved must outweigh the bad; and (6) war must be a last
   resort.

   Once just reasons for going to war are satisfied, conduct in the war—jus
   in bello—must be just as well. Just conduct in a war means that it must be
   specific and proportional. That is, noncombatants and civilians must not
   be deliberately targeted. Further, only such force as is necessary must be
   used, and harms must be proportionate to the goal sought.

   Law of War

   Some of the just war theories have been adopted as parts of international
   agreements and incorporated into the law of war (i.e., international law)
   that regulates the resort to armed force, the conduct of hostilities, and
   the protection of war victims.

   The Geneva Conventions, for example, are a series of international
   treaties that are designed to protect noncombatants, civilians, and
   prisoners of war. The treaties were negotiated in Geneva, Switzerland,
   between 1864 and 1977. The First and Second Geneva Conventions apply to
   sick and wounded soldiers and sailors. They contain provisions related to
   protecting the wounded and sick, as well as medical personnel and
   transports. The Third Geneva Convention applies to prisoners of war, and
   the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to people in occupied territories.
   The Third Convention requires humane treatment of prisoners, including
   adequate food and water. The Fourth Convention includes provisions that
   forbid torture and the taking of hostages, as well as provisions related
   to medical care and hospitals.

   war, in the popular sense, a conflict between political groups involving
   hostilities of considerable duration and magnitude. In the usage of social
   science, certain qualifications are added. Sociologists usually apply the
   term to such conflicts only if they are initiated and conducted in
   accordance with socially recognized forms. They treat war as an
   institution recognized in custom or in law. Military writers usually
   confine the term to hostilities in which the contending groups are
   sufficiently equal in power to render the outcome uncertain for a time.
   Armed conflicts of powerful states with isolated and powerless peoples are
   usually called pacifications, military expeditions, or explorations; with
   small states, they are called interventions or reprisals; and with
   internal groups, rebellions or insurrections. Such incidents, if the
   resistance is sufficiently strong or protracted, may achieve a magnitude
   that entitles them to the name “war.”

   In all ages war has been an important topic of analysis. In the latter
   part of the 20th century, in the aftermath of two World Wars and in the
   shadow of nuclear, biological, and chemical holocaust, more was written on
   the subject than ever before. Endeavours to understand the nature of war,
   to formulate some theory of its causes, conduct, and prevention, are of
   great importance, for theory shapes human expectations and determines
   human behaviour. The various schools of theorists are generally aware of
   the profound influence they can exercise upon life, and their writings
   usually include a strong normative element, for, when accepted by
   politicians, their ideas can assume the characteristics of self-fulfilling
   prophecies.

   The analysis of war may be divided into several categories. Philosophical,
   political, economic, technological, legal, sociological, and psychological
   approaches are frequently distinguished. These distinctions indicate the
   varying focuses of interest and the different analytical categories
   employed by the theoretician, but most of the actual theories are mixed
   because war is an extremely complex social phenomenon that cannot be
   explained by any single factor or through any single approach.

Evolution of theories of war

   Battle of Waterloo[ Submit ]

   Reflecting changes in the international system, theories of war have
   passed through several phases in the course of the past three centuries.
   After the ending of the wars of religion, about the middle of the 17th
   century, wars were fought for the interests of individual sovereigns and
   were limited both in their objectives and in their scope. The art of
   maneuver became decisive, and analysis of war was couched accordingly in
   terms of strategies. The situation changed fundamentally with the outbreak
   of the French Revolution, which increased the size of forces from small
   professional to large conscript armies and broadened the objectives of war
   to the ideals of the revolution, ideals that appealed to the masses who
   were subject to conscription. In the relative order of post-Napoleonic
   Europe, the mainstream of theory returned to the idea of war as a
   rational, limited instrument of national policy. This approach was best
   articulated by the Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz in his
   famous classic On War (1832–37).

   World War I, which was “total” in character because it resulted in the
   mobilization of entire populations and economies for a prolonged period of
   time, did not fit into the Clausewitzian pattern of limited conflict, and
   it led to a renewal of other theories. These no longer regarded war as a
   rational instrument of state policy. The theorists held that war, in its
   modern, total form, if still conceived as a national state instrument,
   should be undertaken only if the most vital interests of the state,
   touching upon its very survival, are concerned. Otherwise, warfare serves
   broad ideologies and not the more narrowly defined interests of a
   sovereign or a nation. Like the religious wars of the 17th century, war
   becomes part of “grand designs,” such as the rising of the proletariat in
   communist eschatology or the Nazi doctrine of a master race.

   Some theoreticians have gone even further, denying war any rational
   character whatsoever. To them war is a calamity and a social disaster,
   whether it is afflicted by one nation upon another or conceived of as
   afflicting humanity as a whole. The idea is not new—in the aftermath of
   the Napoleonic Wars it was articulated, for example, by Tolstoy in the
   concluding chapter of War and Peace (1865–69). In the second half of the
   20th century it gained new currency in peace research, a contemporary form
   of theorizing that combines analysis of the origins of warfare with a
   strong normative element aiming at its prevention. Peace research
   concentrates on two areas: the analysis of the international system and
   the empirical study of the phenomenon of war.

   World War II and the subsequent evolution of weapons of mass destruction
   made the task of understanding the nature of war even more urgent. On the
   one hand, war had become an intractable social phenomenon, the elimination
   of which seemed to be an essential precondition for the survival of
   mankind. On the other hand, the use of war as an instrument of policy was
   calculated in an unprecedented manner by the nuclear superpowers, the
   United States and the Soviet Union. War also remained a stark but rational
   instrumentality in certain more limited conflicts, such as those between
   Israel and the Arab nations. Thinking about war, consequently, became
   increasingly more differentiated because it had to answer questions
   related to very different types of conflict.

   Carl von Clausewitz[ Submit ]
   Carl von Clausewitz
   Military strategist Carl von Clausewitz, lithograph by Franz Michelis
   after an oil painting by Wilhelm Wach, 1830.(more)

   Clausewitz cogently defines war as a rational instrument of foreign
   policy: “an act of violence intended to compel our opponent to fulfill our
   will.” Modern definitions of war, such as “armed conflict between
   political units,” generally disregard the narrow, legalistic definitions
   characteristic of the 19th century, which limited the concept to formally
   declared war between states. Such a definition includes civil wars but at
   the same time excludes such phenomena as insurrections, banditry, or
   piracy. Finally, war is generally understood to embrace only armed
   conflicts on a fairly large scale, usually excluding conflicts in which
   fewer than 50,000 combatants are involved.

   The High Price of Losing Ukraine

   Military-Strategic and Financial Implications of Russian Victory

   By Frederick W. Kagan, Kateryna Stepanenko, Mitchell Belcher, Noel
   Mikkelsen, and Thomas Bergeron

   The High Price of Losing Ukraine - Part 2

   ISW's Nataliya Bugayova says that if Russia wins in Ukraine, US
   adversaries will learn that the United States can be manipulated into
   abandoning its interests in a winnable fight.

   If the West Cuts Aid to Ukraine, Russia Will Win. If the West Leans in,
   Ukraine Can Win.

   Fred Kagan writes about why the positional war in Ukraine is not a stable
   stalemate and how the current balance could readily be tipped in either
   direction by decisions made in the West.

Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, December 24, 2023

   Dec 24, 2023 - ISW Press

   European Union (EU) Foreign Affairs High Representative Josep Borrell
   stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not interested in a
   limited territorial victory in Ukraine and will continue the war “until
   the final victory.” Borrell reported on December 24 that Putin would not
   be satisfied with capturing a “piece” of Ukraine and allowing the rest of
   Ukraine to join the EU. Borrell added that Putin will not “give up the
   war” and called on the West to prepare for a “conflict of high intensity
   for a long time.” Borrell’s statements are consistent with ISW’s
   assessment that Russia is not interested in a ceasefire or good-faith
   negotiations with Ukraine but retains its maximalist goals of a full
   Russian victory in Ukraine.

Iran Update, December 24, 2023

   Dec 24, 2023 - ISW Press

   Iran and the Houthis are functioning as a coalition to conduct combined
   military operations targeting international shipping in the Red Sea. Iran
   considers the Axis of Resistance as its unconventional alliance of state,
   semi-state, and non-state actors. Their anti-US and anti-Israeli ideology
   unites the Axis of Resistance, creating strategic alignment across its
   members. Multiple US officials have highlighted the role Iran plays in the
   targeting and execution of Houthi attacks against international shipping.
   Iran provides the weapons and uses advisers on the ground in Yemen and at
   least one spy ship anchored in the Red Sea to support its Houthi partners,
   who execute the attacks based on Iranian advice and intelligence.

Iran Update, December 23, 2023

   Dec 23, 2023 - ISW Press

   Iran and its so-called “Axis of Resistance” are signaling their capability
   and willingness to attack maritime targets beyond just the Persian Gulf
   and Red Sea. A one-way drone struck a commercial vessel off the coast of
   India, causing structural damage to the ship, on December 23. The vessel
   is partially Israeli-owned. Israeli media reported that Iran was
   responsible for the attack, which is consistent with the ongoing
   anti-shipping campaign that Iran and the Houthi movement have conducted
   around the Bab al Mandeb in recent weeks. This attack follows the Islamic
   Resistance of Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—claiming
   on December 22 that it conducted an unspecified attack on a “vital target”
   in the Mediterranean Sea. There is no evidence that the Islamic Resistance
   of Iraq conducted an attack into the Mediterranean Sea at the time of
   writing. The claim, nevertheless, signals the readiness of the Iraqi group
   to participate in the Iran-led attack campaign on maritime targets.
   Finally, a senior commander in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps
   (IRGC), Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Naghdi, threatened to expand the
   anti-shipping campaign to the Mediterranean Sea and Strait of Gibraltar on
   December 23. Naghdi frequently makes inflammatory threats toward Iranian
   adversaries, but his statement is particularly noteworthy given the drone
   attack off the Indian coast and the claimed attack by the Islamic
   Resistance of Iraq. Iran and its Axis of Resistance are likely messaging
   their capability and willingness to widen geographically their
   anti-shipping attack campaign in response to the United States forming a
   multinational naval task force to safeguard commercial traffic around the
   Red Sea.

Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, December 23, 2023

   Dec 23, 2023 - ISW Press

   The New York Times (NYT) - citing former and current senior Russian, US,
   and international officials - reported that Russian President Vladimir
   Putin is using back channels and intermediaries to signal his interest in
   a ceasefire, despite Putin’s recent public statements to the contrary. NYT
   reported that Western officials have been picking up renewed signals
   through backchannels since September 2023 that Putin is interested in a
   ceasefire that freezes the current frontlines, but noted that Western
   officials warned the backchannels could be “Kremlin misdirection” and may
   not reflect a “genuine willingness” to negotiate. NYT suggested several
   possible motivations Putin may have for his reported interest in a
   ceasefire: the upcoming March 2024 Russian presidential election, a desire
   to “keep his options open” regarding the war’s resolution and take
   advantage of perceived waning Western support for Ukraine, and the
   “distraction” of the Israel-Hamas war. All these motivations reflect
   temporary reasons why Putin might pursue a temporary ceasefire that would
   benefit Russia by allowing Russia the time to prepare for renewed
   aggression against Ukraine, as ISW has routinely assessed. The NYT noted
   that Putin’s public rhetoric, which has recently reasserted Russia’s
   maximalist objectives that are tantamount to full Ukrainian and Western
   surrender, is at odds with Putin’s reported private desire to “declare
   victory and move on.” Neither the NYT nor its sources offered any reason
   to believe Putin’s backchannel communications would be more reflective of
   his goals than his public speeches addressing domestic, Ukrainian, and
   international audiences. The NYT report also failed to make clear whether
   Putin’s alleged interest in a ceasefire is for a temporary pause or a
   permanent end to the war.

The High Price of Losing Ukraine: Part 2 — The Military Threat and Beyond

   Dec 22, 2023 - ISW Press

   Allowing Russia to win its war in Ukraine would be a self-imposed
   strategic defeat for the United States. The United States would face the
   risk of a larger and costlier war in Europe. The United States would face
   the worst threat from Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union, as a
   victorious Russia would likely emerge reconstituted and more determined to
   undermine the United States — and confident that it can. A Russian victory
   would diminish America’s deterrence around the world, emboldening others
   with an explicit or latent intent to harm the United States. A Russian
   victory would create an ugly world in which the atrocities associated with
   Russia’s way of war and way of ruling the populations under its control
   are normalized. Most dangerous of all, however, US adversaries would learn
   that they can break America’s will to act in support of their strategic
   interests.

The Order of Battle of Hamas’ Izz al Din al Qassem Brigades

   Dec 22, 2023 - ISW Press

   This report presents the order of battle (ORBAT) of the al Qassem Brigades
   at the brigade and the battalion level. The lack of adequate reporting on
   Hamas’ units at the company level and below precludes a more detailed
   presentation of those echelons. This ORBAT presents the formal structure
   of the al Qassem Brigades during the Israeli ground operation in Israel.
   The actual structure of the al Qassem Brigades may change as the ground
   operation progresses and Israeli forces destroy Hamas units or render them
   combat ineffective.

   The Russo-Ukrainian War^[c] is an ongoing international conflict between
   Russia and Ukraine, which began in February 2014.^[d] Following Ukraine's
   Revolution of Dignity, Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine and supported
   pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian military in the Donbas war.
   The first eight years of conflict also included naval incidents,
   cyberwarfare, and heightened political tensions. In February 2022, Russia
   launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and began occupying more of the
   country.

   In early 2014, the Euromaidan protests led to the Revolution of Dignity
   and the ousting of Ukraine's pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych.
   Shortly after, pro-Russian unrest erupted in eastern and southern Ukraine.
   Simultaneously, unmarked Russian troops moved into Ukraine's Crimea and
   took over government buildings, strategic sites and infrastructure. Russia
   soon annexed Crimea after a highly disputed referendum. In April 2014,
   Russian-backed separatist forces seized government buildings in Ukraine's
   eastern Donbas region and proclaimed the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR)
   and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) as independent states, starting
   the Donbas war. The separatists received considerable but covert support
   from Russia, and Ukrainian attempts to fully retake separatist-held areas
   failed. Although Russia denied involvement, Russian troops took part in
   the fighting. In February 2015, Russia and Ukraine signed the Minsk II
   agreements to end the conflict, but they were never fully implemented in
   the years that followed. The Donbas war settled into a violent but static
   conflict between Ukraine and the Russian and separatist forces, with many
   brief ceasefires but no lasting peace and few changes in territorial
   control.

   Beginning in 2021, Russia built up a large military presence near its
   border with Ukraine, including within neighbouring Belarus. Russian
   officials repeatedly denied plans to attack Ukraine. Russian president
   Vladimir Putin criticized the enlargement of NATO and demanded that
   Ukraine be barred from ever joining the military alliance. He also
   expressed irredentist views and questioned Ukraine's right to exist.
   Russia recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states in February 2022.
   Putin announced a "special military operation" to "demilitarize and
   denazify" Ukraine, claiming Russia had no plans to occupy the country.
   Russian forces invaded Ukraine. The invasion was internationally
   condemned; many countries imposed sanctions against Russia and increased
   existing sanctions. Russia abandoned an attempt to take Kyiv in early
   April 2022 amid fierce resistance. From August, Ukrainian forces began
   recapturing territories in the north-east and south. In late September,
   Russia declared the annexation of four partially-occupied regions of
   Ukraine, which was internationally condemned. Russia spent the winter
   conducting inconclusive offensives in the Donbas, and in spring 2023 dug
   into positions ahead of another Ukrainian counteroffensive. The war has
   resulted in a refugee crisis and tens of thousands of deaths.

  Independent Ukraine and the Orange Revolution

   Further information: Orange Revolution

   After the dissolution of the Soviet Union (USSR) in 1991, Ukraine and
   Russia maintained close ties. In 1994, Ukraine agreed to accede to the
   Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a non-nuclear-weapon
   state.^[4] Former Soviet nuclear weapons in Ukraine were removed and
   dismantled.^[5] In return, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United
   States agreed to uphold the territorial integrity and political
   independence of Ukraine through the Budapest Memorandum on Security
   Assurances.^[6]^[7] In 1999, Russia was one of the signatories of the
   Charter for European Security, which "reaffirmed the inherent right of
   each and every participating State to be free to choose or change its
   security arrangements, including treaties of alliance, as they
   evolve."^[8] In the years after the dissolution of the USSR, several
   former Eastern Bloc countries joined NATO, partly in response to regional
   security threats involving Russia such as the 1993 Russian constitutional
   crisis, the War in Abkhazia (1992–1993) and the First Chechen War
   (1994–1996). Putin claimed Western powers broke promises not to let any
   Eastern European countries join.^[9]^[10]

   [IMG]Protesters in Independence Square in Kyiv during the Orange
   Revolution, November 2004

   The 2004 Ukrainian presidential election was controversial. During the
   election campaign, opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned by
   TCDD dioxin;^[11]^[12] he later accused Russia of involvement.^[13] In
   November, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych was declared the winner,
   despite allegations of vote-rigging by election observers.^[14] During a
   two-month period which became known as the Orange Revolution, large
   peaceful protests successfully challenged the outcome. After the Supreme
   Court of Ukraine annulled the initial result due to widespread electoral
   fraud, a second round re-run was held, bringing to power Yushchenko as
   president and Yulia Tymoshenko as prime minister, and leaving Yanukovych
   in opposition.^[15] The Orange Revolution is often grouped together with
   other early-21st century protest movements, particularly within the former
   USSR, known as colour revolutions. According to Anthony Cordesman, Russian
   military officers viewed such colour revolutions as attempts by the US and
   European states to destabilise neighbouring countries and undermine
   Russia's national security.^[16] Russian President Vladimir Putin accused
   organisers of the 2011–2013 Russian protests of being former advisors to
   Yushchenko, and described the protests as an attempt to transfer the
   Orange Revolution to Russia.^[17] Rallies in favour of Putin during this
   period were called "anti-Orange protests".^[18]

   At the 2008 Bucharest summit, Ukraine and Georgia sought to join NATO. The
   response among NATO members was divided; Western European countries
   opposed offering Membership Action Plans (MAP) in order to avoid
   antagonising Russia, while US President George W. Bush pushed for their
   admission.^[19] NATO ultimately refused to offer Ukraine and Georgia MAPs,
   but also issued a statement agreeing that "these countries will become
   members of NATO" at some point. Putin voiced strong opposition to Georgia
   and Ukraine's NATO membership bids.^[20] By January 2022, the possibility
   of Ukraine joining NATO remained remote.^[21]

   In 2009, Yanukovych announced his intent to again run for president in the
   2010 Ukrainian presidential election,^[22] which he subsequently won.^[23]
   In November 2013, a wave of large, pro-European Union (EU) protests
   erupted in response to Yanukovych's sudden decision not to sign the
   EU–Ukraine Association Agreement, instead choosing closer ties to Russia
   and the Eurasian Economic Union. On 22 February 2013 the Ukrainian
   parliament had overwhelmingly approved of finalizing the agreement with
   the EU,^[24] subsequent to which Russia had put pressure on Ukraine to
   reject it using the threat of sanctions, with Kremlin adviser Sergei
   Glazyev pronouncing that if the agreement was signed Russia could not
   guarantee Ukraine's status as a state.^[25]^[26]

  Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and pro-Russian unrest

   Main articles: Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and 2014 pro-Russian
   unrest in Ukraine

   Following months of protests as part of the Euromaidan movement, on 21
   February 2014 Yanukovych and the leaders of the parliamentary opposition
   signed a settlement agreement that called for early elections. The
   following day, Yanukovych fled from the capital ahead of an impeachment
   vote that stripped him of his powers as president.^[27]^[28]^[29]^[30] On
   23 February, the Rada adopted a bill to repeal the 2012 law which gave the
   Russian language an official status.^[31] The bill was not enacted;^[32]
   however, the proposal provoked negative reactions in the Russian-speaking
   regions of Ukraine,^[33] intensified by Russian media saying that the
   ethnic Russian population was in imminent danger.^[34]

   On 27 February, an interim government was established and early
   presidential elections were scheduled. The following day, Yanukovych
   resurfaced in Russia and in a press conference declared that he remained
   the acting president of Ukraine, just as Russia was beginning its overt
   military campaign in Crimea. Leaders of Russian-speaking eastern regions
   of Ukraine declared continuing loyalty to Yanukovych,^[28]^[35] causing
   the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine.

  Russian military bases in Crimea

   Main article: Political status of Crimea

   At the onset of the conflict, Russia had roughly 12,000 military personnel
   in the Black Sea Fleet,^[34] in several locations in the Crimean peninsula
   like Sevastopol, Kacha, Hvardiiske, Simferopol Raion, Sarych, and others.
   In 2005 a dispute broke out over control of the Sarych cape lighthouse
   near Yalta, and a number of other beacons.^[36]^[37] Russian presence was
   allowed by the basing and transit agreement with Ukraine. Under the
   agreements the Russian military in Crimea was constrained to a maximum of
   25,000 troops; they were required to: respect the sovereignty of Ukraine,
   honor its legislation, not interfere in the internal affairs of the
   country, and show their "military identification cards" when crossing the
   international border.^[38] Early in the conflict, the agreement's sizeable
   troop limit allowed Russia to significantly reinforce its military
   presence under the plausible guise of security concerns, deploy special
   forces and other required capabilities to conduct the operation in
   Crimea.^[34]

   According to the original treaty on the division of the Soviet Black Sea
   Fleet signed in 1997, Russia was allowed to have its military bases in
   Crimea until 2017, after which it would evacuate all military units
   including its portion of the Black Sea Fleet out of the Autonomous
   Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol. On 21 April 2010, former Ukrainian
   president Viktor Yanukovych signed a new deal known as the Kharkiv Pact,
   to resolve the 2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute; it extended the stay to
   2042 with an option to renew.^[39]

  Legality and declaration of war

   Further information: On conducting a special military operation

   No formal declaration of war has been issued in the ongoing
   Russo-Ukrainian War. When Putin announced the 2022 Russian invasion of
   Ukraine, he claimed to commence a "special military operation",
   side-stepping a formal declaration of war.^[40] The statement was,
   however, regarded as a declaration of war by the Ukrainian government^[41]
   and reported as such by many international news sources.^[42]^[43] While
   the Ukrainian parliament refers to Russia as a "terrorist state" in regard
   to its military actions in Ukraine,^[44] it has not issued a formal
   declaration of war on its behalf.

   The Russian invasion of Ukraine violated international law (including the
   Charter of the United Nations).^[52]^[53]^[54]^[55] The invasion has also
   been called a crime of aggression under international criminal law^[56]
   and under some countries' domestic criminal codes – including those of
   Ukraine and Russia – although procedural obstacles exist to prosecutions
   under these laws.^[57]^[58]

   Forces of Ukraine during the capture of Crimea by Russia in February–March
   2014 [IMG]Russian troops blocking the Ukrainian military base in Perevalne

   On 20 February 2014, Russia began an annexation of
   Crimea.^[59]^[60]^[61]^[62] On 22 and 23 February, in the relative power
   vacuum immediately after the ousting of Yanukovych,^[63] Russian troops
   and special forces began moving into Crimea through Novorossiysk.^[61] On
   27 February, Russian forces without insignias began their advance into the
   Crimean Peninsula.^[64] They took strategic positions and captured the
   Crimean Parliament, raising a Russian flag. Security checkpoints isolated
   the Crimean Peninsula from the rest of Ukraine and restricted movement
   within the territory.^[65]^[66]^[67]^[68]

   In the following days, Russian soldiers secured key airports and a
   communications center.^[69] Russian cyberattacks shut down websites
   associated with the Ukrainian government, news media, and social media.
   Cyberattacks also enabled Russian access to the mobile phones of Ukrainian
   officials and members of parliament, further disrupting
   communications.^[70]

   On 1 March, the Russian legislature approved the use of armed forces,
   leading to an influx of Russian troops and military hardware into the
   peninsula.^[69] In the following days, all remaining Ukrainian military
   bases and installations were surrounded and besieged, including the
   Southern Naval Base. After Russia formally annexed the peninsula on 18
   March, Ukrainian military bases and ships were stormed by Russian forces.
   On 24 March, Ukraine ordered troops to withdraw; by 30 March, all
   Ukrainian forces had left the peninsula.

   On 15 April, the Ukrainian parliament declared Crimea a territory
   temporarily occupied by Russia.^[71] After the annexation, the Russian
   government increased its military presence in the region and made nuclear
   threats.^[72] Putin said that a Russian military task force would be
   established in Crimea.^[73] In November, NATO stated that it believed
   Russia was deploying nuclear-capable weapons to Crimea.^[74] Since the
   annexation of Crimea, certain NATO members have been providing training
   for the Ukrainian army.^[75]

    Pro-Russia unrest

   Main article: 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine

   From late February 2014, demonstrations by pro-Russian and anti-government
   groups took place in major cities across the eastern and southern regions
   of Ukraine.^[76] The first protests across southern and eastern Ukraine
   were largely native expressions of discontent with the new Ukrainian
   government.^[76]^[77] Russian involvement at this stage was limited to
   voicing support for the demonstrations.^[77]^[78] Russia exploited this,
   however, launching a coordinated political and military campaign against
   Ukraine.^[77]^[79] Putin gave legitimacy to the separatists when he
   described the Donbas as part of "New Russia" (Novorossiya), and expressed
   bewilderment as to how the region had ever become part of Ukraine.^[80]

   Russia continued to marshal forces near Ukraine's eastern border in late
   March, reaching 30–40,000 troops by April.^[81]^[34] The deployment was
   used to threaten escalation and disrupt Ukraine's response.^[34] This
   threat forced Ukraine to divert forces to its borders instead of the
   conflict zone.^[34]

   Ukrainian authorities cracked down on the pro-Russian protests and
   arrested local separatist leaders in early March. Those leaders were
   replaced by people with ties to the Russian security services and
   interests in Russian businesses.^[82] By April 2014, Russian citizens had
   taken control of the separatist movement, supported by volunteers and
   materiel from Russia, including Chechen and Cossack
   fighters.^[83]^[84]^[85]^[86] According to Donetsk People's Republic (DPR)
   commander Igor Girkin, without this support in April, the movement would
   have dissipated, as it had in Kharkiv and Odesa.^[87] The separatist
   groups held disputed referendums in May,^[88]^[89]^[90] which were not
   recognised by Ukraine or any other UN member state.^[88]

    Armed conflict

   [IMG]Ukrainian response to Russian activities in Donbas after seizure of
   Sloviansk on 12 April. April–May 2014.

   In April, armed conflict began in eastern Ukraine between Russian-backed
   separatist forces and Ukraine. The separatists declared the People's
   Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. From 6 April, militants occupied
   government buildings in many cities and took control of border crossings
   to Russia, transport hubs, a broadcasting center, and other strategic
   infrastructure. On 12 April several armed groups took cities of Sloviansk,
   Kramatorsk and then Horlivka, Druzhkivka in subsequent days. They were led
   by people like retired Russian colonel Igor Girkin and lieutenant colonel
   Igor Bezler. Faced with continued expansion of separatist territorial
   control, on 15 April the interim Ukrainian government launched an
   "Anti-Terrorist Operation" (ATO); however, Ukrainian forces were poorly
   prepared and ill-positioned and the operation quickly stalled.^[91]

   By the end of April, Ukraine announced it had lost control of the
   provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk. It claimed to be on "full combat alert"
   against a possible Russian invasion and reinstated conscription to its
   armed forces.^[92] Through May, the Ukrainian campaign focused on
   containing the separatists by securing key positions around the ATO zone
   to position the military for a decisive offensive once Ukraine's national
   mobilization had completed.

   As conflict between the separatists and the Ukrainian government escalated
   in May, Russia began to employ a "hybrid approach", combining
   disinformation tactics, irregular fighters, regular Russian troops, and
   conventional military support.^[93]^[94]^[95] The First Battle of Donetsk
   Airport followed the Ukrainian presidential elections. It marked a turning
   point in conflict; it was the first battle between the separatists and the
   Ukrainian government that involved large numbers of Russian
   "volunteers".^[96]^[97]^: 15  According to Ukraine, at the height of the
   conflict in the summer of 2014, Russian paramilitaries made up between 15%
   and 80% of the combatants.^[85] From June Russia trickled in arms, armor,
   and munitions.

   On 17 July 2014, Russian-controlled forces shot down a passenger aircraft,
   Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, as it was flying over eastern Ukraine.^[98]
   Investigations and the recovery of bodies began in the conflict zone as
   fighting continued.^[99]^[100]^[101]

   By the end of July, Ukrainian forces were pushing into cities, to cut off
   supply routes between the two, isolating Donetsk and attempting to restore
   control of the Russo-Ukrainian border. By 28 July, the strategic heights
   of Savur-Mohyla were under Ukrainian control, along with the town of
   Debaltseve, an important railroad hub.^[102] These operational successes
   of Ukrainian forces threatened the existence of the DPR and LPR statelets,
   prompting Russian cross-border shelling targeted at Ukrainian troops on
   their own soil, from mid-July onwards.^[103]

    August 2014 Russian invasion

   See also: Battle of Ilovaisk
   [IMG]June–August 2014 progression map

   After a series of military defeats and setbacks for the separatists, who
   united under the banner of "Novorossiya",^[104]^[105] Russia dispatched
   what it called a "humanitarian convoy" of trucks across the border in
   mid-August 2014. Ukraine called the move a "direct invasion".^[106]
   Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council reported that convoys were
   arriving almost daily in November (up to 9 convoys on 30 November) and
   that their contents were mainly arms and ammunition. Strelkov claimed that
   in early August, Russian servicemen, supposedly on "vacation" from the
   army, began to arrive in Donbas.^[107]

   By August 2014, the Ukrainian "Anti-Terrorist Operation" shrank the
   territory under pro-Russian control, and approached the border.^[108] Igor
   Girkin urged Russian military intervention, and said that the combat
   inexperience of his irregular forces, along with recruitment difficulties
   amongst the local population, had caused the setbacks. He stated, "Losing
   this war on the territory that President Vladimir Putin personally named
   New Russia would threaten the Kremlin's power and, personally, the power
   of the president".^[109]

   In response to the deteriorating situation, Russia abandoned its hybrid
   approach, and began a conventional invasion on 25 August 2014.^[108]^[110]
   On the following day, the Russian Defence Ministry said these soldiers had
   crossed the border "by accident".^[111]^[112]^[113] According to Nikolai
   Mitrokhin's estimates, by mid-August 2014 during the Battle of Ilovaisk,
   between 20,000 and 25,000 troops were fighting in the Donbas on the
   separatist side, and only 40–45% were "locals".^[114]

   On 24 August 2014, Amvrosiivka was occupied by Russian paratroopers,^[115]
   supported by 250 armoured vehicles and artillery pieces.^[116] The same
   day, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko referred to the operation as
   Ukraine's "Patriotic War of 2014" and a war against external
   aggression.^[117]^[118] On 25 August, a column of Russian military
   vehicles was reported to have crossed into Ukraine near Novoazovsk on the
   Azov sea coast. It appeared headed towards Ukrainian-held
   Mariupol,^[119]^[120]^[121]^[122]^[123] in an area that had not seen
   pro-Russian presence for weeks.^[124] Russian forces captured
   Novoazovsk.^[125] and Russian soldiers began deporting Ukrainians who did
   not have an address registered within the town.^[126] Pro-Ukrainian
   anti-war protests took place in Mariupol.^[126]^[127] The UN Security
   Council called an emergency meeting.^[128]

   [IMG]Residents of Kyiv with Sich Battalion volunteers on 26 August 2014

   The Pskov-based 76th Guards Air Assault Division allegedly entered
   Ukrainian territory in August and engaged in a skirmish near Luhansk,
   suffering 80 dead. The Ukrainian Defence Ministry said that they had
   seized two of the unit's armoured vehicles near Luhansk, and reported
   destroying another three tanks and two armoured vehicles in other
   regions.^[129]^[130] The Russian government denied the skirmish took
   place,^[130] but on 18 August, the 76th was awarded the Order of Suvorov,
   one of Russia's highest awards, by Russian minister of defence Sergey
   Shoigu for the "successful completion of military missions" and "courage
   and heroism".^[130]

   The speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament and Russian state
   television channels acknowledged that Russian soldiers entered Ukraine,
   but referred to them as "volunteers".^[131] A reporter for Novaya Gazeta,
   an opposition newspaper in Russia, stated that the Russian military
   leadership paid soldiers to resign their commissions and fight in Ukraine
   in the early summer of 2014, and then began ordering soldiers into
   Ukraine.^[132] Russian opposition MP Lev Shlosberg made similar
   statements, although he said combatants from his country are "regular
   Russian troops", disguised as units of the DPR and LPR.^[133]

   In early September 2014, Russian state-owned television channels reported
   on the funerals of Russian soldiers who had died in Ukraine, but described
   them as "volunteers" fighting for the "Russian world". Valentina
   Matviyenko, a top United Russia politician, also praised "volunteers"
   fighting in "our fraternal nation".^[131] Russian state television for the
   first time showed the funeral of a soldier killed fighting in
   Ukraine.^[134]

   On 3 September, Poroshenko said he and Putin had reached a "permanent
   ceasefire" agreement.^[135] Russia denied this, denying that it was a
   party to the conflict, adding that "they only discussed how to settle the
   conflict".^[136]^[137] Poroshenko then recanted.^[138]^[139] On 5
   September Russia's Permanent OSCE Representative Andrey Kelin, said that
   it was natural that pro-Russian separatists "are going to liberate"
   Mariupol. Ukrainian forces stated that Russian intelligence groups had
   been spotted in the area. Kelin said 'there might be volunteers over
   there.'^[140] On 4 September 2014, a NATO officer said that several
   thousand regular Russian forces wereoperating in Ukraine.^[141]

   On 5 September 2014, the Minsk Protocol ceasefire agreement drew a line of
   demarcation between Ukraine and separatist-controlled portions of Donetsk
   and Luhansk Oblasts.

   On 7 and 12 November, NATO officials reconfirmed the Russian presence,
   citing 32 tanks, 16 howitzer cannons and 30 trucks of troops entering the
   country.^[142] US general Philip M. Breedlove said "Russian tanks, Russian
   artillery, Russian air defence systems and Russian combat troops" had been
   sighted.^[74]^[143] NATO said it had seen an increase in Russian tanks,
   artillery pieces and other heavy military equipment in Ukraine and renewed
   its call for Moscow to withdraw its forces.^[144] The Chicago Council on
   Global Affairs stated that Russian separatists enjoyed technical
   advantages over the Ukrainian army since the large inflow of advanced
   military systems in mid-2014: effective anti-aircraft weapons ("Buk",
   MANPADS) suppressed Ukrainian air strikes, Russian drones provided
   intelligence, and Russian secure communications system disrupted Ukrainian
   communications intelligence. The Russian side employed electronic warfare
   systems that Ukraine lacked. Similar conclusions about the technical
   advantage of the Russian separatists were voiced by the Conflict Studies
   Research Centre.^[145] In the 12 November United Nations Security Council
   meeting, the United Kingdom's representative accused Russia of
   intentionally constraining OSCE observation missions' capabilities,
   pointing out that the observers were allowed to monitor only two
   kilometers of border, and drones deployed to extend their capabilities
   were jammed or shot down.^[146]^[non-primary source needed]

   In January 2015, Donetsk, Luhansk, and Mariupol represented the three
   battle fronts.^[148] Poroshenko described a dangerous escalation on 21
   January amid reports of more than 2,000 additional Russian troops, 200
   tanks and armed personnel carriers crossing the border. He abbreviated his
   visit to the World Economic Forum because of his concerns.^[149]

   A new package of measures to end the conflict, known as Minsk II, was
   agreed on 15 February 2015.^[150] On 18 February, Ukrainian forces
   withdrew from Debatlseve, in the last high-intensity battle of the Donbas
   war until 2022. In September 2015 the United Nations Human Rights Office
   estimated that 8000 casualties had resulted from the conflict.^[151]

   war in Donbas (2016), and Timeline of the war in Donbas (2017)

   After the Minsk agreements, the war settled into static trench warfare
   around the agreed line of contact, with few changes in territorial
   control. The conflict was marked by artillery duels, special forces
   operations, and trench warfare. Hostilities never ceased for a substantial
   period of time, but continued at a low level despite repeated attempts at
   ceasefire. In the months after the fall of Debaltseve, minor skirmishes
   continued along the line of contact, but no territorial changes occurred.
   Both sides began fortifying their position by building networks of
   trenches, bunkers and tunnels, turning the conflict into static trench
   warfare.^[152]^[153] The relatively static conflict was labelled a
   "frozen" by some,^[154] but Russia never achieved this as the fighting
   never stopped.^[155]^[156] Between 2014 and 2022 there were 29 ceasefires,
   each agreed to remain in force indefinitely. However, none of them lasted
   more than two weeks.^[157]

   US and international officials continued to report the active presence of
   Russian military in eastern Ukraine, including in the Debaltseve
   area.^[158] In 2015, Russian separatist forces were estimated to number
   around 36,000 troops (compared to 34,000 Ukrainian), of whom 8,500–10,000
   were Russian soldiers. Additionally, around 1,000 GRU troops were
   operating in the area.^[159] Another 2015 estimate held that Ukrainian
   forces outnumbered Russian forces 40,000 to 20,000.^[160] In 2017, on
   average one Ukrainian soldier died in combat every three days,^[161] with
   an estimated 6,000 Russian and 40,000 separatist troops in the
   region.^[162]^[163]

   [IMG]Casualties of the war in Donbas

   Cases of killed and wounded Russian soldiers were discussed in local
   Russian media.^[164] Recruiting for Donbas was performed openly via
   veteran and paramilitary organisations. Vladimir Yefimov, leader of one
   such organisation, explained how the process worked in the Ural area. The
   organisation recruited mostly army veterans, but also policemen,
   firefighters etc. with military experience. The cost of equipping one
   volunteer was estimated at 350,000 rubles (around $6500) plus salary of
   60,000 to 240,000 rubles per month.^[165] The recruits received weapons
   only after arriving in the conflict zone. Often, Russian troops traveled
   disguised as Red Cross personnel.^[166]^[167]^[168]^[169] Igor Trunov,
   head of the Russian Red Cross in Moscow, condemned these convoys, saying
   they complicated humanitarian aid delivery.^[170] Russia refused to allow
   OSCE to expand its mission beyond two border crossings.^[171]

   The volunteers were issued a document claiming that their participation
   was limited to "offering humanitarian help" to avoid Russian mercenary
   laws. Russia's anti-mercenary legislation defined a mercenary as someone
   who "takes part [in fighting] with aims counter to the interests of the
   Russian Federation".^[165]

   In August 2016, the Ukrainian intelligence service, the SBU, published
   telephone intercepts from 2014 of Sergey Glazyev (Russian presidential
   adviser), Konstantin Zatulin, and other people in which they discussed
   covert funding of pro-Russian activists in Eastern Ukraine, the occupation
   of administration buildings and other actions that triggered the
   conflict.^[172] As early as February 2014, Glazyev gave direct
   instructions to various pro-Russian parties on how to take over local
   administration offices, what to do afterwards, how to formulate demands,
   and promised support from Russia, including "sending our
   guys".^[173]^[174]^[175]

   Russia gained de facto control of the Kerch Strait in 2014. In 2017,
   Ukraine appealed to a court of arbitration over the use of the strait. By
   2018 Russia had built a bridge over the strait, limiting the size of ships
   that could pass through, imposed new regulations, and repeatedly detained
   Ukrainian vessels.^[176] On 25 November 2018, three Ukrainian boats
   traveling from Odesa to Mariupol were seized by Russian warships; 24
   Ukrainian sailors were detained.^[177]^[178] A day later on 26 November
   2018, the Ukrainian parliament overwhelmingly backed the imposition of
   martial law along Ukraine's coastal regions and those bordering
   Russia.^[179]

   Zelenskyy took office promising to end the war in Donbas.^[180] In
   December 2019, Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists began swapping
   prisoners of war. Around 200 prisoners were exchanged on 29 December
   2019.^[181]^[182]^[183]^[184] According to Ukrainian authorities, 50
   Ukrainian soldiers were killed in 2020.^[185] Since 2019, Russia has

   From March to April 2021, Russia commenced a major military build-up near
   the border, followed by a second build-up between October 2021 to February
   2022 in Russia and Belarus.^[188] Throughout, the Russian government
   repeatedly denied it had plans to attack Ukraine.^[189]^[190]

   In early December 2021, following Russian denials, the US released
   intelligence of Russian invasion plans, including satellite photographs
   showing Russian troops and equipment near the border.^[191] The
   intelligence reported a Russian list of key sites and individuals to be
   killed or neutralized.^[192] The US released multiple reports that
   accurately predicted the invasion plans.^[192]

    Russian accusations and demands

   Russian irredentism
   [IMG]Ukrainian deputy prime minister Olha Stefanishyna with NATO
   secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg at a conference on 10 January 2022
   regarding a potential Russian invasion

   In the months preceding the invasion, Russian officials accused Ukraine of
   inciting tensions, Russophobia, and repressing Russian speakers. They made
   multiple security demands of Ukraine, NATO, and other EU countries. On 9
   December 2021 Putin said that "Russophobia is a first step towards
   genocide".^[193]^[194] Putin's claims were dismissed by the international
   community,^[195] and Russian claims of genocide were rejected as
   baseless.^[196]^[197]^[198] In a 21 February speech,^[199] Putin
   questioned the legitimacy of the Ukrainian state, repeating an inaccurate
   claim that "Ukraine never had a tradition of genuine statehood".^[200] He
   incorrectly stated that Vladimir Lenin had created Ukraine, by carving a
   separate Soviet Republic out of what Putin said was Russian land, and that
   Nikita Khrushchev "took Crimea away from Russia for some reason and gave
   it to Ukraine" in 1954.^[201]

   Putin falsely claimed that Ukrainian society and government were dominated
   by neo-Nazism, invoking the history of collaboration in German-occupied
   Ukraine during World War II,^[202]^[203] and echoing an antisemitic
   conspiracy theory that cast Russian Christians, rather than Jews, as the
   true victims of Nazi Germany.^[204]^[195] Ukraine does have a far-right
   fringe, including the neo-Nazi linked Azov Battalion and Right
   Sector.^[205]^[203] Analysts described Putin's rhetoric as greatly
   exaggerated.^[206]^[202] Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, stated that his
   grandfather served in the Soviet army fighting against the Nazis;^[207]
   three of his family members were killed in the Holocaust.^[206]

   [IMG]A U.S. intelligence assessment map and imagery on Russian military
   movement nearby the Ukrainian border, as on 3 December 2021. It assessed
   that Russia had deployed about 70,000 military personnel mostly about
   100–200 kilometres (62–124 mi) from the Ukrainian border, with an
   assessment this could be increased to 175,000 personnel. Published by The
   Washington Post.^[208]

   During the second build-up, Russia demanded a treaty that would forbid
   Ukraine from ever joining NATO, and end all NATO activity in its Eastern
   European member states.^[209] These demands were rejected.^[210] A treaty
   to prevent Ukraine joining NATO would go against the alliance's "open
   door" policy and the principle of self-determination, although NATO made
   no efforts to comply with Ukraine's requests to join.^[211] NATO Secretary
   General Jens Stoltenberg replied that "Russia has no say" on whether
   Ukraine joins, and that "Russia has no right to establish a sphere of
   influence to try to control their neighbors".^[212] NATO offered to
   improve communications with Russia and discuss missile placements and
   military exercises, as long as Russia withdrew troops from Ukraine's
   borders,^[213] but Russia did not withdraw.

    Prelude to full invasion

   Fighting in Donbas escalated significantly from 17 February 2022
   onwards.^[214] The Ukrainians and the pro-Russian separatists each accused
   the other of attacks.^[215]^[216] There was a sharp increase in artillery
   shelling by the Russian-led militants in Donbas, which was considered by
   Ukraine and its supporters to be an attempt to provoke the Ukrainian army
   or create a pretext for invasion.^[217]^[218]^[219] On 18 February, the
   Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics ordered mandatory emergency
   evacuations of civilians from their respective capital
   cities,^[220]^[221]^[222] although observers noted that full evacuations
   would take months.^[223] The Russian government intensified its
   disinformation campaign, with Russian state media promoting fabricated
   videos (false flags) on a nearly hourly basis purporting to show Ukrainian
   forces attacking Russia.^[224] Many of the disinformation videos were
   amateurish, and evidence showed that the claimed attacks, explosions, and
   evacuations in Donbas were staged by Russia.^[224]^[225]^[226]

   Putin's address to the nation on 21 February (English subtitles available)

   On 21 February at 22:35 (UTC+3),^[227] Putin announced that the Russian
   government would diplomatically recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk people's
   republics.^[228] The same evening, Putin directed that Russian troops
   deploy into Donbas, in what Russia referred to as a "peacekeeping
   mission".^[229]^[230] On 22 February, the Federation Council unanimously
   authorised Putin to use military force outside Russia.^[231] In response,
   Zelenskyy ordered the conscription of army reservists;^[232] The following
   day, Ukraine's parliament proclaimed a 30-day nationwide state of
   emergency and ordered the mobilisation of all
   reservists.^[233]^[234]^[235] Russia began to evacuate its embassy in
   Kyiv.^[236]

   On the night of 23 February,^[237] Zelenskyy gave a speech in Russian in
   which he appealed to the citizens of Russia to prevent war.^[238]^[239] He
   rejected Russia's claims about neo-Nazis and stated that he had no
   intention of attacking the Donbas.^[240] Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov
   said on 23 February that the separatist leaders in Donetsk and Luhansk had
   sent a letter to Putin stating that Ukrainian shelling had caused civilian
   deaths and appealing for military support.^[241]

  Full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022–present)

   For a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Russian invasion of
   Ukraine.
   [IMG]Animated map of Russia's invasion of Ukraine through 5 December 2022
   (click to play animation)

   The Russian invasion of Ukraine began on the morning of 24 February
   2022,^[242] when Putin announced a "special military operation" to
   "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine.^[243]^[244] Minutes later, missiles
   and airstrikes hit across Ukraine, including Kyiv, shortly followed by a
   large ground invasion along multiple fronts.^[245]^[246] Zelenskyy
   declared martial law and a general mobilisation of all male Ukrainian
   citizens between 18 and 60, who were banned from leaving the
   country.^[247]^[248]

   Russian attacks were initially launched on a northern front from Belarus
   towards Kyiv, a southern front from Crimea, and a south-eastern front from
   Luhansk and Donetsk and towards Kharkiv.^[249]^[250] In the northern
   front, amidst heavy losses and strong Ukrainian resistance surrounding
   Kyiv, Russia's advance stalled in March, and by April its troops
   retreated. On 8 April, Russia placed its forces in southern and eastern
   Ukraine under the command of General Aleksandr Dvornikov, and some units
   withdrawn from the north were redeployed to the Donbas.^[251] On 19 April,
   Russia launched a renewed attack across a 500 kilometres (300 mi) long
   front extending from Kharkiv to Donetsk and Luhansk.^[252] By 13 May, a
   Ukraine counter-offensive had driven back Russian forces near Kharkiv. By
   20 May, Mariupol fell to Russian troops following a prolonged siege of the
   Azovstal steel works.^[253]^[254] Russian forces continued to bomb both
   military and civilian targets far from the frontline.^[255]^[256] The war
   caused the largest refugee and humanitarian crisis within Europe since the
   Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s;^[257]^[258] the UN described it as the
   fastest-growing such crisis since World War II.^[259] In the first week of
   the invasion, the UN reported over a million refugees had fled Ukraine;
   this subsequently rose to over 7,405,590 by 24 September, a reduction from
   over eight million due to some refugees' return.^[260]^[261]

   [IMG]Ukrainian soldiers killed in the Russo-Ukrainian War in 2022

   Ukrainian forces launched counteroffensives in the south in August, and in
   the northeast in September. On 30 September, Russia annexed four oblasts
   of Ukraine which it had partially conquered during the invasion.^[262]
   This annexation was generally unrecognized and condemned by the countries
   of the world.^[263] After Putin announced that he would begin conscription
   drawn from the 300,000 citizens with military training and potentially the
   pool of about 25 million Russians who could be eligible for conscription,
   one-way tickets out of the country nearly or completely sold
   out.^[264]^[265] The Ukrainian offensive in the northeast successfully
   recaptured the majority of Kharkiv Oblast in September. In the course of
   the southern counteroffensive, Ukraine retook the city of Kherson in
   November and Russian forces withdrew to the east bank of the Dnieper
   River.^[citation needed]

   The invasion was internationally condemned as a war of
   aggression.^[266]^[267] A United Nations General Assembly resolution
   demanded a full withdrawal of Russian forces, the International Court of
   Justice ordered Russia to suspend military operations and the Council of
   Europe expelled Russia. Many countries imposed new sanctions, which
   affected the economies of Russia and the world,^[268] and provided
   humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine.^[269] In September 2022, Putin
   signed a law that would punish anyone who resists conscription with a
   10-year prison sentence^[270] resulting in an international push to allow
   asylum for Russians fleeing conscription.^[271]

   According to an estimate published by The New York Times, as of February
   2023, the "number of Russian troops killed and wounded in Ukraine is
   approaching 200,000."^[272]

Human rights violations

   See also: Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War, Humanitarian situation
   during the war in Donbas, and Russian war crimes § Ukraine

   Violations of human rights and atrocity crimes have both occurred during
   the war. From 2014 to 2021, there were more than 3,000 civilian
   casualties, with most occurring in 2014 and 2015.^[273] The right of
   movement was impeded for the inhabitants of the conflict zone.^[274]
   Arbitrary detention was practiced by both sides in the first years of the
   conflict. It decreased after 2016 in government-held areas, while in the
   separatist-held ones it continued.^[275] Investigations into the abuses
   committed by both sides made little progress.^[276]^[277]

   Since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russian
   authorities and armed forces have committed multiple war crimes in the
   form of deliberate attacks against civilian targets,^[278]^[279] massacres
   of civilians, torture and rape of women and children,^[280]^[281] and
   indiscriminate attacks in densely populated areas. After the Russian
   withdrawal from areas north of Kyiv, overwhelming evidence of war crimes
   by Russian forces was discovered. In particular, in the town of Bucha,
   evidence emerged of a massacre of civilians perpetrated by Russian troops,
   including torture, mutilation, rape, looting and deliberate killings of
   civilians.^[282]^[283]^[284] the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in
   Ukraine (OHCHR) has documented the murder of at least 73 civilians –
   mostly men, but also women and children – in Bucha.^[285] More than 1,200
   bodies of civilians were found in the Kyiv region after Russian forces
   withdrew, some of them summarily executed. There were reports of forced
   deportations of thousands of civilians, including children, to Russia,
   mainly from Russian-occupied Mariupol,^[286]^[287] as well as sexual
   violence, including cases of rape, sexual assault and gang rape,^[288] and
   deliberate killing of Ukrainian civilians by Russian forces.^[289]

   Ukrainian forces have also been accused of committing various war crimes,
   including mistreatment of detainees, though on a much smaller scale than
   Russian forces.^[290]^[291]

  Gas disputes

   [IMG]Major Russian natural gas pipelines to Europe [IMG]
     Europe TTF natural gas

   Until 2014 Ukraine was the main transit route for Russian natural gas sold
   to Europe, which earned Ukraine about US$3 billion a year in transit fees,
   making it the country's most lucrative export service.^[295] Following
   Russia's launch of the Nord Stream pipeline, which bypasses Ukraine, gas
   transit volumes steadily decreased.^[295] Following the start of the
   Russo-Ukrainian War in February 2014, severe tensions extended to the gas
   sector.^[296]^[297] The subsequent outbreak of war in the Donbas region
   forced the suspension of a project to develop Ukraine's own shale gas
   reserves at the Yuzivska gas field, which had been planned as a way to
   reduce Ukrainian dependence on Russian gas imports.^[298] Eventually, the
   EU commissioner for energy Günther Oettinger was called in to broker a
   deal securing supplies to Ukraine and transit to the EU.^[299]

   An explosion damaged a Ukrainian portion of the Urengoy–Pomary–Uzhhorod
   pipeline in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast in May 2014. Ukrainian officials blamed
   Russian terrorists.^[300] Another section of the pipeline exploded in the
   Poltava Oblast on 17 June 2014, one day after Russia limited the supply of
   gas to Ukrainian customers due to non-payment. Ukraine's Interior Minister
   Arsen Avakov said the following day that the explosion had been caused by
   a bomb.^[301]

   In 2015, Russian state media reported that Russia planned to completely
   abandon gas supplies to Europe through Ukraine after 2018.^[302]^[303]
   Russia's state-owned energy giant Gazprom had already substantially
   reduced the volumes of gas transited across Ukraine, and expressed its
   intention to reduce the level further by means of transit-diversification
   pipelines (Turkish Stream, Nord Stream, etc.).^[304] Gazprom and Ukraine
   agreed to a five-year deal on Russian gas transit to Europe at the end of
   2019.^[305]^[306]

   In 2020, the TurkStream natural gas pipeline running from Russia to Turkey
   changed the regional gas flows in South-East Europe by diverting the
   transit through Ukraine and the Trans Balkan Pipeline system.^[307]^[308]

   In May 2021, the Biden administration waived Trump's CAATSA sanctions on
   the company behind Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to
   Germany.^[309]^[310] Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said he was "surprised"
   and "disappointed" by Joe Biden's decision.^[311] In July 2021, the U.S.
   urged Ukraine not to criticise a forthcoming agreement with Germany over
   the pipeline.^[312]^[313]

   In July 2021, Biden and German Chancellor Angela Merkel concluded a deal
   that the U.S. might trigger sanctions if Russia used Nord Stream as a
   "political weapon". The deal aimed to prevent Poland and Ukraine from
   being cut off from Russian gas supplies. Ukraine will get a $50 million
   loan for green technology until 2024 and Germany will set up a billion
   dollar fund to promote Ukraine's transition to green energy to compensate
   for the loss of the gas-transit fees. The contract for transiting Russian
   gas through Ukraine will be prolonged until 2034, if the Russian
   government agrees.^[314]^[315]^[316]

   In August 2021, Zelenskyy warned that the Nord Stream 2 natural gas
   pipeline between Russia and Germany was "a dangerous weapon, not only for
   Ukraine but for the whole of Europe."^[317]^[318] In September 2021,
   Ukraine's Naftogaz CEO Yuriy Vitrenko accused Russia of using natural gas
   as a "geopolitical weapon".^[319] Vitrenko stated that "A joint statement
   from the United States and Germany said that if the Kremlin used gas as a
   weapon, there would be an appropriate response. We are now waiting for the
   imposition of sanctions on a 100% subsidiary of Gazprom, the operator of
   Nord Stream 2."^[320]

  Hybrid warfare

   The Russo-Ukrainian conflict has also included elements of hybrid warfare
   using non-traditional means. Cyberwarfare has been used by Russia in
   operations including successful attacks on the Ukrainian power grid in
   December 2015 and in December 2016, which was the first successful cyber
   attack on a power grid,^[321] and the Mass hacker supply-chain attack in
   June 2017, which the US claimed was the largest known cyber attack.^[322]
   In retaliation, Ukrainian operations have included the Surkov Leaks in
   October 2016 which released 2,337 e-mails in relation to Russian plans for
   seizing Crimea from Ukraine and fomenting separatist unrest in
   Donbas.^[323] The Russian information war against Ukraine has been another
   front of hybrid warfare waged by Russia.

   A Russian fifth column in Ukraine has also been claimed to exist among the
   Party of Regions, the Communist Party, the Progressive Socialist Party and
   the Russian Orthodox Church.^[324]^[325]^[326]

   his country's invasion of Ukraine.^[327]

   False stories have been used to provoke public outrage during the war. In
   April 2014, Russian news channels Russia-1 and NTV showed a man saying he
   was attacked by a fascist Ukrainian gang on one channel and on the other
   channel saying he was funding the training of right-wing anti-Russia
   radicals.^[328]^[329] A third segment portrayed the man as a neo-Nazi
   surgeon.^[330] In May 2014, Russia-1 aired a story about Ukrainian
   atrocities using footage of a 2012 Russian operation in North
   Caucasus.^[331] In the same month, the Russian news network Life presented
   a 2013 photograph of a wounded child in Syria as a victim of Ukrainian
   troops who had just retaken Donetsk International Airport.^[332]

   In June 2014, several Russian state news outlets reported that Ukraine was
   using white phosphorus using 2004 footage of white phosphorus being used
   by the United States in Iraq.^[331] In July 2014, Channel One Russia
   broadcast an interview with a woman who said that a 3-year-old boy who
   spoke Russian was crucified by Ukrainian nationalists in a fictitious
   square in Sloviansk that turned out to be false.^[333]^[334]^[329]^[331]

   In 2022, Russian state media told stories of genocide and mass graves full
   of ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine. One set of graves outside Luhansk
   was dug when intense fighting in 2014 cut off the electricity in the local
   morgue. Amnesty International investigated 2014 Russian claims of mass
   graves filled with hundreds of bodies and instead found isolated incidents
   of extrajudicial executions by both sides.^[335]^[336]^[337] The Russian
   censorship apparatus Roskomnadzor ordered the country's media to employ
   information only from Russian state sources or face fines and
   blocks,^[338] and ordered media and schools to describe the war as a
   "special military operation".^[339] On 4 March 2022, Putin signed into law
   a bill introducing prison sentences of up to 15 years for those who
   publish "fake news" about the Russian military and its operations,^[340]
   leading to some media outlets to stop reporting on Ukraine.^[341] Russia's
   opposition politician Alexei Navalny said the "monstrosity of lies" in the
   Russian state media "is unimaginable. And, unfortunately, so is its
   persuasiveness for those who have no access to alternative
   information."^[342] He tweeted that "warmongers" among Russian state media
   personalities "should be treated as war criminals. From the
   editors-in-chief to the talk show hosts to the news editors, [they] should
   be sanctioned now and tried someday."^[343]

   Putin and Russian media have described the government of Ukraine as being
   led by neo-Nazis persecuting ethnic Russians who are in need of protection
   by Russia, despite Ukraine's President Zelenskyy being
   Jewish.^[344]^[345]^[336] According to journalist Natalia Antonova,
   "Russia's present-day war of aggression is refashioned by propaganda into
   a direct continuation of the legacy of the millions of Russian soldiers
   who died to stop" Nazi Germany in World War II.^[346] Ukraine's rejection
   of the adoption of Russia-initiated General Assembly resolutions on
   combating the glorification of Nazism, the latest iteration of which is
   General Assembly Resolution A/C.3/76/L.57/Rev.1 on Combating Glorification
   of Nazism, Neo-Nazism and other Practices that Contribute to Fueling
   Contemporary Forms of Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and
   Related Intolerance, serve to present Ukraine as a pro-Nazi state, and
   indeed likely forms the basis for Russia's claims, with the only other
   state rejecting the adoption of the resolution being the US.^[347]^[348]
   The Deputy US Representative for ECOSOC describes such resolutions as
   "thinly veiled attempts to legitimize Russian disinformation campaigns
   denigrating neighboring nations and promoting the distorted Soviet
   narrative of much of contemporary European history, using the cynical
   guise of halting Nazi glorification".^[349]

   NAFO ('North Atlantic Fellas Organization'), a loose cadre of online
   'shitposters' vowing to fight Russian disinformation generally identified
   by cartoon Shiba Inu dogs in social media, gained notoriety after June
   2022, in the wake of a Twitter quarrel with Russian diplomat Mikhail
   Ulyanov.^[350]

  Russia–NATO relations

   Main article: Russia–NATO relations

   In his speech justifying the invasion of Ukraine, Putin falsely claimed
   that NATO military infrastructure was being built up inside Ukraine and
   was a threat to Russia.^[351] Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov
   characterized the conflict as a proxy war started by NATO.^[352] He said:
   "We don't think we're at war with NATO ... Unfortunately, NATO believes it
   is at war with Russia".^[353] NATO says it is not at war with Russia; its
   official policy is that it does not seek confrontation, but rather its
   members support Ukraine in "its right to self-defense, as enshrined in the
   UN Charter".^[354] NATO and Russia had co-operated until Russia annexed
   Crimea.^[354] Former CIA director Leon Panetta told the ABC that the U.S.
   is 'without question' involved in a proxy war with Russia.^[355]

   Russian military aircraft flying over the Baltic and Black Seas often do
   not indicate their position or communicate with air traffic controllers,
   thus posing a potential risk to civilian airliners. NATO aircraft
   scrambled many times to track and intercept these aircraft near alliance
   airspace. The Russian aircraft intercepted never entered NATO airspace,
   and the interceptions were conducted in a safe and routine manner.^[356]

    Ukrainian response

   [IMG]Following Russia's annexation of Crimea, Ukraine blocked the North
   Crimean Canal, which provided 85% of Crimea's drinking and irrigation
   water.^[357]

   Interim Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov accused Russia of
   "provoking a conflict" by backing the seizure of the Crimean parliament
   building and other government offices on the Crimean peninsula. He
   compared Russia's military actions to the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, when
   Russian troops occupied parts of the Republic of Georgia and the breakaway
   enclaves of Abkhazia and South Ossetia were established under the control
   of Russian-backed administrations. He called on Putin to withdraw Russian
   troops from Crimea and stated that Ukraine will "preserve its territory"
   and "defend its independence".^[358] On 1 March, he warned, "Military
   intervention would be the beginning of war and the end of any relations
   between Ukraine and Russia."^[359] On 1 March, Acting President Oleksandr
   Turchynov placed the Armed Forces of Ukraine on full alert and combat
   readiness.^[360]

   The Ministry of Temporarily Occupied Territories and IDPs was established
   by Ukrainian government on 20 April 2016 to manage occupied parts of
   Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea regions affected by Russian military
   intervention of 2014.^[361]

   eastern Europe that began in April 2014.

   On 4 March 2014, the United States pledged $1 billion in aid to
   Ukraine.^[362] Russia's actions increased tensions in nearby countries
   historically within its sphere of influence, particularly the Baltic and
   Moldova. All have large Russian-speaking populations, and Russian troops
   are stationed in the breakaway Moldovan territory of Transnistria.^[363]
   Some devoted resources to increasing defensive capabilities,^[364] and
   many requested increased support from the U.S. and the North Atlantic
   Treaty Organization, which they had joined in recent years.^[363]^[364]
   The conflict "reinvigorated" NATO, which had been created to face the
   Soviet Union, but had devoted more resources to "expeditionary missions"
   in recent years.^[365]

   In addition to diplomatic support in its conflict with Russia, the U.S.
   provided Ukraine with US$1.5 billion in military aid during the
   2010s.^[366] In 2018 the U.S. House of Representatives passed a provision
   blocking any training of Azov Battalion of the Ukrainian National Guard by
   American forces. In previous years, between 2014 and 2017, the U.S. House
   of Representatives passed amendments banning support of Azov, but due to
   pressure from the Pentagon, the amendments were quietly
   lifted.^[367]^[368]^[369]

   The initial reaction to the escalation of tensions in Crimea caused the
   Russian and European stock market to tumble.^[370] The intervention caused
   the Swiss franc to climb to a 2-year high against the dollar and 1-year
   high against the Euro. The Euro and the US dollar both rose, as did the
   Australian dollar.^[371] The Russian stock market declined by more than 10
   percent, while the Russian ruble hit all-time lows against the US dollar
   and the Euro.^[372]^[373]^[374] The Russian central bank hiked interest

   $12 billion^[clarification needed] to try to stabilize its currency.^[371]
   Prices for wheat and grain rose, with Ukraine being a major exporter of
   both crops.^[375]

   Later in March 2014, the reaction of the financial markets to the Crimea
   annexation was surprisingly mellow, with global financial markets rising
   immediately after the referendum held in Crimea, one explanation being
   that the sanctions were already priced in following the earlier Russian
   incursion.^[376] Other observers considered that the positive reaction of
   the global financial markets on Monday 17 March 2014, after the
   announcement of sanctions against Russia by the EU and the US, revealed
   that these sanctions were too weak to hurt Russia.^[377] In early August
   2014, the German DAX was down by 6 percent for the year, and 11 percent
   since June, over concerns Russia, Germany's 13th biggest trade partner,
   would retaliate against sanctions.^[378]

   A poll of the Ukrainian public, excluding Russian-annexed Crimea, was
   taken by the International Republican Institute from 12 to 25 September
   2014.^[379] 89% of those polled opposed 2014 Russian military intervention
   in Ukraine. As broken down by region, 78% of those polled from Eastern
   Ukraine (including Dnipropetrovsk Oblast) opposed said intervention, along
   with 89% in Southern Ukraine, 93% in Central Ukraine, and 99% in Western
   Ukraine.^[379] As broken down by native language, 79% of Russian speakers
   and 95% of Ukrainian speakers opposed the intervention. 80% of those
   polled said the country should remain a unitary country.^[379]

   A poll of the Crimean public in Russian-annexed Crimea was taken by the
   Ukrainian branch of Germany's biggest market research organization, GfK,
   on 16–22 January 2015. According to its results: "Eighty-two percent of
   those polled said they fully supported Crimea's inclusion in Russia, and
   another 11 percent expressed partial support. Only 4 percent spoke out
   against it."^[380]^[381]^[382]

   A joint poll conducted by Levada and the Kyiv International Institute of
   Sociology from September to October 2020 found that in the breakaway
   regions controlled by the DPR/LPR, just over half of the respondents
   wanted to join Russia (either with or without some autonomous status)
   while less than one-tenth wanted independence and 12% wanted reintegration
   into Ukraine. It contrasted with respondents in Kyiv-controlled Donbas,
   where a vast majority felt the separatist regions should be returned to
   Ukraine.^[383] According to results from Levada in January 2022, roughly
   70% of those in the breakaway regions said their territories should become
   part of the Russian Federation.^[384]

   In March 2022, a week after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 98% of
   Ukrainians – including 82% of ethnic Russians living in Ukraine – said
   they did not believe that any part of Ukraine was rightfully part of
   Russia, according to Lord Ashcroft's polls which did not include Crimea
   and the separatist-controlled part of Donbas. 97% of Ukrainians said they
   had an unfavourable view of Russian President Vladimir Putin, with a
   further 94% saying they had an unfavourable view of the Russian Armed
   Forces.^[389]

   At the end of 2021, 75% of Ukrainians said they had a positive attitude
   toward ordinary Russians, while in May 2022, 82% of Ukrainians said they
   had a negative attitude toward ordinary Russians.^[390]

   An April 2022 survey by the Levada Centre reported that approximately 74%
   of the Russians polled supported the "special military operation" in
   Ukraine, suggesting that Russian public opinion has shifted considerably
   since 2014.^[392] According to some sources, a reason many Russians
   supported the "special military operation" has to do with the propaganda
   and disinformation.^[393]^[394] In addition, it has been suggested that
   some respondents did not want to answer pollsters' questions for fear of
   negative consequences.^[395]^[396] At the end of March, a poll conducted
   in Russia by the Levada Center concluded the following: When asked why
   they think the military operation is taking place, respondents said it was
   to protect and defend civilians, ethnic Russians or Russian speakers in
   Ukraine (43%), to prevent an attack on Russia (25%), to get rid of
   nationalists and "denazify" Ukraine (21%), and to incorporate Ukraine or
   the Donbas region into Russia (3%)."^[397] According to polls, the Russian
   President's rating rose from 71% on the eve of the invasion to 82% in
   March 2023.^[398]

    United States

   On 28 April 2022, US President Joe Biden asked Congress for an additional
   $33 billion to assist Ukraine, including $20 billion to provide weapons to
   Ukraine.^[399] On 5 May, Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced
   that Ukraine had received more than $12 billion worth of weapons and
   financial aid from Western countries since the start of Russia's invasion
   on 24 February.^[400] On 21 May 2022, the United States passed legislation
   providing $40 billion in new military and humanitarian foreign aid to
   Ukraine, marking a historically large commitment of funds.^[401]^[402] In
   August 2022, U.S. defense spending to counter the Russian war effort
   exceeded the first 5 years of war costs in Afghanistan. The Washington
   Post reported that new U.S. weapons delivered to the Ukrainian war front
   suggest a closer combat scenario with more casualties.^[403] The United
   States looks to build "enduring strength in Ukraine" with increased arms
   shipments and a record-breaking $3 billion military aid package.^[403]

    Russian military suppliers

   After expending large amounts of heavy weapons and munitions over months,
   the Russian Federation received combat drones, loitering munitions, and
   large amounts of artillery from Iran, deliveries of tanks and other
   armoured vehicles from Belarus, and reportedly planned to trade for
   artillery ammunition from North Korea and ballistic missiles from
   Iran.^[404]^[405]^[406]^[407]^[408]

   The U.S. has accused China of providing Russia with technology it needs
   for high-tech weapons, allegations which China has denied. The U.S.
   sanctioned a Chinese firm for providing satellite imagery to Russian
   mercenary forces fighting in Ukraine.^[409]

   In March 2023, Western nations had pressed the United Arab Emirates to
   halt re-exports of goods to Russia which had military uses, amidst
   allegations that the Gulf country exported 158 drones to Russia in
   2022.^[410] In May 2023, the U.S. accused South Africa of supplying arms
   to Russia in a covert naval operation,^[411] allegations which have been
   denied by South African president Cyril Ramaphosa.^[412]

    1. ^ ^a ^b The Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's
       Republic were Russian-controlled puppet states that declared their
       independence from Ukraine in May 2014. In 2022 they received
       international recognition from each other, Russia, Syria and North
       Korea, and some other partially recognised states. On 30 September
       2022 Russia declared it had formally annexed both entities.
    2. ^ There remain "some contradictions and inherent problems" regarding
       the date on which the annexation began.^[413] Ukraine claims 20
       February 2014 as "the beginning of the temporary occupation of Crimea
       and Sevastopol by Russia", citing the timeframe inscribed on the
       Russian medal "For the Return of Crimea",^[414] and in 2015 the
       Ukrainian parliament officially designated the date as such.^[415] On
       20 February 2014, Vladimir Konstantinov who at that time was a
       chairman of the republican council of Crimea and representing the
       Party of Regions expressed his thoughts about secession of the region
       from Ukraine.^[416] On 23 February 2014 the Russian ambassador to
       Ukraine Mikhail Zurabov was recalled to Moscow due to a "worsening of
       [the] situation in Ukraine". In early March 2015, President Putin
       stated in a Russian movie about the annexation of Crimea that he
       ordered the operation to "restore" Crimea to Russia following an
       all-night emergency meeting on 22–23 February 2014,^[413]^[417] and in
       2018 the Russian Foreign Minister claimed that the earlier "start
       date" on the medal was due to a "technical misunderstanding".^[418]

   Casualties and losses
   21,500+ casualties (1965–2013)^[2]^[needs update]

   The Israeli–Palestinian conflict is an ongoing military and political
   conflict in the Levant. Beginning in the mid-20th century, it is one of
   the world's longest-continuing conflicts.^[3] Various attempts have been
   made to resolve the conflict as part of the Israeli–Palestinian peace
   process, alongside other efforts to resolve the broader Arab–Israeli
   conflict.^[4]^[5]^[6]^[7] Public declarations of the desire to see a
   Jewish homeland established in Palestine, including the First Zionist
   Congress of 1897 and the Balfour Declaration of 1917, created early
   tensions in the region after waves of Jewish immigration. Following World
   War I, the Mandate for Palestine included a binding obligation for the
   "establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people".
   Tensions grew into open sectarian conflict between Jews and Arabs.^[8]^[9]
   The 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was never implemented
   and provoked the 1947–1949 Palestine War. The current Israeli-Palestinian
   status quo began following Israeli military occupation of the West Bank
   and Gaza, known as the Palestinian territories, in the 1967 Six-Day War.

   Progress was made towards a two-state solution with the Oslo Accords of
   1993–1995. Final status issues include the status of Jerusalem, Israeli
   settlements, borders, security and water rights^[10] as well as
   Palestinian freedom of movement^[11] and the Palestinian right of return.
   The violence of the conflict in the region—rich in sites of historic,
   cultural, and religious interest worldwide—has been the subject of
   numerous international conferences dealing with historic rights, security
   issues, and human rights, and has been a factor limiting access to, and
   tourism in, areas that are highly contested.^[12] The majority of peace
   efforts have been centred around the two-state solution, which involves
   the establishment of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.
   Public support for a two-state solution, which formerly enjoyed support
   from both Israeli Jews and Palestinians,^[13]^[14]^[15] has dwindled in
   recent years.^[16]^[17]^[18]

   Within Israeli and Palestinian society, the conflict generates a wide
   variety of views and opinions, including that the violence perpetrated by
   the Israelis against the Palestinians is part of a genocide, and that
   Palestinians use worldwide terrorism to promote their interests. Since its
   inception, the conflict's casualties have not been restricted to
   combatants, with a large number of civilian fatalities on both sides. A
   minority of Jewish Israelis (32 percent) support a two-state solution with
   the Palestinians.^[19] Israeli Jews are divided along ideological lines,
   and many favor maintaining the status quo.^[17] Approximately 60 percent
   of Palestinians (77% in the Gaza Strip and 46% in the West Bank), support
   armed attacks against Israelis within Israel as a means of ending the
   occupation, while 70% believe that a two-state solution is no longer
   practical or possible as a result of the expansion of Israeli
   settlements.^[18] More than two-thirds of Israeli Jews say that if the
   West Bank were annexed by Israel, Palestinians resident there should not
   be permitted to vote.^[20] Mutual distrust and significant disagreements
   are deep over basic issues, as is the reciprocal skepticism about the
   other side's commitment to upholding obligations in an eventual bilateral
   agreement.^[21] Since 2006, the Palestinian side has been fractured by
   conflict between Fatah, the traditionally dominant party, and its later
   electoral challenger, Hamas, a militant Islamist group that gained control
   of the Gaza Strip.^[22] Attempts to remedy this have been repeated and
   continuing. Since 2019, the Israeli side has also been experiencing
   political upheaval, with four inconclusive legislative elections having
   been held over a span of two years.^[23]^[24] The latest round of peace
   negotiations began in July 2013 but were suspended in 2014. Since 2006,
   Hamas and Israel have fought five wars, the most recent in 2023.^[22]

   The two parties that engage in direct negotiation are the Israeli
   government and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Official
   negotiations are mediated by the Quartet on the Middle East, which
   consists of the United Nations, the United States, Russia, and the
   European Union. The Arab League, which has proposed the Arab Peace
   Initiative, is another important actor. Egypt, a founding member of the
   Arab League, has historically been a key participant in the Arab–Israeli
   conflict and related negotiations, more so since the Egypt–Israel peace
   treaty. Another key participant is Jordan, which annexed the West Bank in
   1950 and held it until 1967, relinquishing its territorial claim over it
   to the Palestinians in 1988. An Israel–Jordan peace treaty was signed in
   1994. The Jordanian royal family, the Hashemites, are responsible for
   custodianship over Muslim and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem.

Background

   Main article: Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine
   See also: Arab-Israeli conflict § Background
   [IMG]The Palestinian Arab Christian-owned Falastin newspaper featuring a
   caricature on its 18 June 1936 edition showing Zionism as a crocodile
   under the protection of a British officer telling Palestinian Arabs:
   "don't be afraid!!! I will swallow you peacefully...".^[25]

   The Israeli–Palestinian conflict has its roots in the late 19th and early
   20th centuries, with the birth of major nationalist movements among the
   Jews and among the Arabs, both geared towards attaining sovereignty for
   their people in the Middle East.^[26] The Balfour Declaration was a public
   statement issued by the British government in 1917 during the First World
   War announcing support for the establishment of a "national home for the
   Jewish people" in Palestine.^[27] The collision between those two
   movements in southern Levant upon the emergence of Palestinian nationalism
   after the Franco-Syrian War in the 1920s escalated into the Sectarian
   conflict in Mandatory Palestine in 1930s and 1940s, and expanded into the
   wider Arab–Israeli conflict later on.^[28]

   The return of several hard-line Palestinian Arab nationalists, under the
   emerging leadership of Haj Amin al-Husseini, from Damascus to Mandatory
   Palestine marked the beginning of Palestinian Arab nationalist struggle
   towards establishment of a national home for Arabs of Palestine.^[29] Amin
   al-Husseini, the architect of the Palestinian Arab national movement,
   immediately marked Jewish national movement and Jewish immigration to
   Palestine as the sole enemy to his cause,^[30] initiating large-scale
   riots against the Jews as early as 1920 in Jerusalem and in 1921 in Jaffa.
   Among the results of the violence was the establishment of the Jewish
   paramilitary force Haganah. In 1929, a series of violent riots resulted in
   the deaths of 133 Jews and 116 Arabs, with significant Jewish casualties
   in Hebron and Safed, and the evacuation of Jews from Hebron and Gaza.^[26]

   mass Jewish immigration allowed by the British Mandate. [IMG]Haganah ship

   Port, Mandatory Palestine, 1947

   In the early 1930s, the Arab national struggle in Palestine had drawn many
   Arab nationalist militants from across the Middle East, such as Sheikh
   Izaddin al-Qassam from Syria, who established the Black Hand militant
   group and had prepared the grounds for the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in
   Palestine. Following the death of al-Qassam at the hands of the British in
   late 1935, tensions erupted in 1936 into the Arab general strike and
   general boycott. The strike soon deteriorated into violence, and the Arab
   revolt was bloodily repressed by the British assisted by associated forces
   of the Jewish Settlement Police, the Jewish Supernumerary Police, and
   Special Night Squads.^[28] In the first wave of organized violence,
   lasting until early 1937, most of the Arab groups were defeated by the
   British, and forced expulsion of much of the Arab leadership ensued. The
   revolt led to the establishment of the Peel Commission towards
   partitioning of Palestine, though it was subsequently rejected by the
   Palestinian Arabs. The two main Jewish leaders, Chaim Weizmann and David
   Ben-Gurion, accepted the recommendations but some secondary Jewish leaders
   disapproved of it.^[31]^[32]^[33]

   The renewed violence, which continued sporadically until the beginning of
   World War II, ended with around 5,000 casualties, mostly from the Arab
   side. With the eruption of World War II, the situation in Mandatory
   Palestine calmed down. It allowed a shift towards a more moderate stance
   among Palestinian Arabs under the leadership of the Nashashibi clan and
   even the establishment of the Jewish–Arab Palestine Regiment under British
   command, fighting Germans in North Africa. The more radical exiled faction
   of al-Husseini, however, tended to cooperate with Nazi Germany, and
   participated in the establishment of a pro-Nazi propaganda machine
   throughout the Arab world. The defeat of Arab nationalists in Iraq and
   subsequent relocation of al-Husseini to Nazi-occupied Europe tied his
   hands regarding field operations in Palestine, though he regularly
   demanded that the Italians and the Germans bomb Tel Aviv. By the end of
   World War II, a crisis over the fate of the Holocaust survivors from
   Europe led to renewed tensions between the Yishuv and the Palestinian Arab
   leadership. Immigration quotas were established by the British, while on
   the other hand illegal immigration and Zionist insurgency against the
   British was increasing.^[26]

   On 29 November 1947, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted
   Resolution 181(II)^[34] recommending the adoption and implementation of a
   plan to partition Palestine into an Arab state, a Jewish state and the
   City of Jerusalem.^[35] On the next day, Palestine was swept by violence.
   For four months, under continuous Arab provocation and attack, the Yishuv
   was usually on the defensive while occasionally retaliating.^[36] The Arab
   League supported the Arab struggle by forming the volunteer-based Arab
   Liberation Army, supporting the Palestinian Arab Army of the Holy War,
   under the leadership of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni and Hasan Salama. On the
   Jewish side, the civil war was managed by the major underground militias –
   the Haganah, Irgun and Lehi – strengthened by numerous Jewish veterans of
   World War II and foreign volunteers. By spring 1948, it was already clear
   that the Arab forces were nearing a total collapse, while Yishuv forces
   gained more and more territory, creating a large scale refugee problem of
   Palestinian Arabs.^[26]

  1948 Arab–Israeli War

   Main article: 1948 Arab-Israeli War

   Following the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel on
   14 May 1948, the Arab League decided to intervene on behalf of Palestinian
   Arabs, marching their forces into former British Palestine, beginning the
   main phase of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.^[35] The overall fighting,
   leading to around 15,000 casualties, resulted in cease-fire and armistice
   agreements of 1949, with Israel holding much of the former Mandate
   territory, Jordan occupying and later annexing the West Bank and Egypt
   taking over the Gaza Strip, where the All-Palestine Government was
   declared by the Arab League on 22 September 1948.^[28]

  1956 Arab–Israeli War

   Main article: 1956 Suez Crisis

   Through the 1950s, Jordan and Egypt supported the Palestinian Fedayeen
   militants' cross-border attacks into Israel, while Israel carried out its
   own reprisal operations in the host countries. The 1956 Suez Crisis
   resulted in a short-term Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and exile of
   the All-Palestine Government, which was later restored with Israeli
   withdrawal. The All-Palestine Government was completely abandoned by Egypt
   in 1959 and was officially merged into the United Arab Republic, to the
   detriment of the Palestinian national movement. Gaza Strip then was put
   under the authority of the Egyptian military administrator, making it a de
   facto military occupation. In 1964, however, a new organization, the
   Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), was established by Yasser
   Arafat.^[35] It immediately won the support of most Arab League
   governments and was granted a seat in the Arab League.

  1967 Arab–Israeli War

   Main article: 1967 Six Day War
   [IMG]During the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel captured the West Bank, the
   Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights and the Sinai Peninsula. Each of these
   territories except the Sinai remain under Israeli occupation.

   The 1967 Six-Day War exerted a significant effect upon Palestinian
   nationalism, as Israel gained military control of the West Bank from
   Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt. Consequently, the PLO was unable to
   establish any control on the ground and established its headquarters in
   Jordan, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and supported the
   Jordanian army during the War of Attrition, which included the Battle of
   Karameh. However, the Palestinian base in Jordan collapsed with the
   Jordanian–Palestinian civil war in 1970. The PLO defeat by the Jordanians
   caused most of the Palestinian militants to relocate to South Lebanon,
   where they soon took over large areas, creating the so-called "Fatahland".

  1973 Arab–Israeli War

   Main article: Yom Kippur War

   On October 6, 1973, a coalition of Arab forces consisting of mainly Egypt
   and Syria launched a surprise attack against Israel on the Jewish holy day
   of Yom Kippur. Egyptian and Syria had crossed over the ceasefire lines
   that were agreed upon prior to 1973. Egypt had in particular tried to
   reoccupy much of the area surrounding the Suez Canal, whilst the frontline
   with Syria was mainly situated around the north in the Golan Heights. The
   war concluded with an Israeli victory, with both sides suffering
   tremendous casualties.

  1982 Lebanon War

   Main article: 1982 Lebanon War

   Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon peaked in the early 1970s, as
   Lebanon was used as a base to launch attacks on northern Israel and
   airplane hijacking campaigns worldwide, which drew Israeli retaliation.
   During the Lebanese Civil War, Palestinian militants continued to launch
   attacks against Israel while also battling opponents within Lebanon. In
   1978, the Coastal Road massacre led to the Israeli full-scale invasion
   known as Operation Litani. Israeli forces, however, quickly withdrew from
   Lebanon, and the attacks against Israel resumed. In 1982, following an
   assassination attempt on one of its diplomats by Palestinians, the Israeli
   government decided to take sides in the Lebanese Civil War and the 1982
   Lebanon War commenced. The initial results for Israel were successful.
   Most Palestinian militants were defeated within several weeks, Beirut was
   captured, and the PLO headquarters were evacuated to Tunisia in June by
   Yasser Arafat's decision.^[28]

  First Intifada (1987–1993)

   Main article: First Intifada

   The first Palestinian uprising began in 1987 as a response to escalating
   attacks and the endless occupation. By the early 1990s, international
   efforts to settle the conflict had begun, in light of the success of the
   Egyptian–Israeli peace treaty of 1982. Eventually, the Israeli–Palestinian
   peace process led to the Oslo Accords of 1993, allowing the PLO to
   relocate from Tunisia and take ground in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
   establishing the Palestinian National Authority. The peace process also
   had significant opposition among radical Islamic elements of Palestinian
   society, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, who immediately
   initiated a campaign of attacks targeting Israelis. Following hundreds of
   casualties and a wave of radical anti-government propaganda, Israeli Prime
   Minister Rabin was assassinated by an Israeli far-right extremist who
   objected to the peace initiative. This struck a serious blow to the peace
   process, from which the newly elected government of Israel in 1996 backed
   off.^[26]

  Second Intifada (2000–2005)

   Intifada in early November 2000, throwing a stone at an Israeli tank in

   in Tel Aviv

   Following several years of unsuccessful negotiations, the conflict
   re-erupted as the Second Intifada in September 2000.^[28] The violence,
   escalating into an open conflict between the Palestinian National Security
   Forces and the Israel Defense Forces, lasted until 2004/2005 and led to
   approximately 130 fatalities. In 2005, Israeli Prime Minister Sharon
   ordered the removal of Israeli settlers and soldiers from Gaza. Israel and
   its Supreme Court formally declared an end to occupation, saying it "had
   no effective control over what occurred" in Gaza.^[37] However, the United
   Nations, Human Rights Watch and many other international bodies and NGOs
   continue to consider Israel to be the occupying power of the Gaza Strip as
   Israel controls Gaza Strip's airspace, territorial waters and controls the
   movement of people or goods in or out of Gaza by air or
   sea.^[37]^[38]^[39]

  Fatah–Hamas split (2006–2007)

   In 2006, Hamas won a plurality of 44% in the Palestinian parliamentary
   election. Israel responded it would begin economic sanctions unless Hamas
   agreed to accept prior Israeli–Palestinian agreements, forswear violence,
   and recognize Israel's right to exist, all of which Hamas rejected.^[40]
   After internal Palestinian political struggle between Fatah and Hamas
   erupted into the Battle of Gaza (2007), Hamas took full control of the
   area.^[41] In 2007, Israel imposed a naval blockade on the Gaza Strip, and
   cooperation with Egypt allowed a ground blockade of the Egyptian border.

   The tensions between Israel and Hamas escalated until late 2008, when
   Israel launched operation Cast Lead upon Gaza, resulting in thousands of
   civilian casualties and billions of dollars in damage. By February 2009, a
   ceasefire was signed with international mediation between the parties,
   though the occupation and small and sporadic eruptions of violence
   continued.^[citation needed]

   In 2011, a Palestinian Authority attempt to gain UN membership as a fully
   sovereign state failed. In Hamas-controlled Gaza, sporadic rocket attacks
   on Israel and Israeli air raids still take place.^[42]^[43]^[44]^[45] In
   November 2012, the representation of Palestine in UN was upgraded to a
   non-member observer State, and its mission title was changed from
   "Palestine (represented by PLO)" to "State of Palestine". In 2014, another
   war broke out between Israel and Gaza, resulting in over 70 Israeli and
   over 2,000 Palestinian casualties.^[46]

  Israeli far-right government and 2023 war (2022–present)

   In November 2022, with the election of the 37th government of Israel, a
   coalition government led by Benjamin Netanyahu and notable for its
   inclusion of far-right politicians,^[47] violence in the conflict
   increased, with events such as the January 2023 Jenin incursion, the June
   2023 Jenin incursion, the July 2023 Jenin incursion, the 2023 Neve Yaakov
   shooting, the 2023 Al-Aqsa clashes, and the May 2023 Gaza–Israel clashes,
   alongside Palestinian political violence has produced a death toll in 2023
   that is the highest in the conflict since 2005.^[48] This culminated in
   the 2023 Israel-Hamas War, when Hamas-led militant groups launched a
   surprise attack on southern Israel from the Gaza Strip, killing hundreds
   of Israeli civilians and taking hostages.^[49]^[50] The Israeli military
   retaliated by conducting an extensive aerial bombardment campaign on Gazan
   targets, followed by an ongoing large-scale ground invasion of Gaza with
   the stated goal of destroying Hamas and controlling Gaza
   afterwards.^[51]^[52]^[53]

Peace process

  Oslo Accords (1993, 1995)

   Main article: Oslo Accords
   [IMG]A peace movement poster: Israeli and Palestinian flags and the word
   peace in Arabic and Hebrew.

   In 1993, Israeli officials led by Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leaders
   from the Palestine Liberation Organization led by Yasser Arafat strove to
   find a peaceful solution through what became known as the Oslo peace
   process. A crucial milestone in this process was Arafat's letter of
   recognition of Israel's right to exist. In 1993, the Oslo Accords were
   finalized as a framework for future Israeli–Palestinian relations. The
   crux of the Oslo agreement was that Israel would gradually cede control of
   the Palestinian territories over to the Palestinians in exchange for
   peace. The Oslo process was delicate and progressed in fits and starts.
   The process took a turning point at the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in
   November 1995 and finally unraveled when Arafat and Ehud Barak failed to
   reach an agreement at Camp David in July 2000. Robert Malley, special
   assistant to US President Bill Clinton for Arab–Israeli Affairs, has
   confirmed that while Barak made no formal written offer to Arafat, the US
   did present concepts for peace which were considered by the Israeli side
   yet left unanswered by Arafat: "the Palestinians' principal failing is
   that from the beginning of the Camp David summit onward they were unable
   either to say yes to the American ideas or to present a cogent and
   specific counterproposal of their own".^[54] Consequently, there are
   different accounts of the proposals considered.^[55]^[56]^[57]

  Camp David Summit (2000)

   Main article: 2000 Camp David Summit
   [IMG]Yitzhak Rabin, Bill Clinton, and Yasser Arafat during the Oslo
   Accords on 13 September 1993.

   In July 2000, US President Bill Clinton convened a peace summit between
   Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
   Barak reportedly put forward the following as "bases for negotiation", via
   the US to the Palestinian President: a non-militarized Palestinian state
   split into 3–4 parts containing 87–92%^[en 1] of the West Bank including
   only parts of East Jerusalem, and the entire Gaza Strip,^[58]^[59] as well
   as a stipulation that 69 Jewish settlements (which comprise 85% of the
   West Bank's Jewish settlers) would be ceded to Israel, no right of return
   to Israel, no sovereignty over the Temple Mount or any core East Jerusalem
   neighbourhoods, and continued Israel control over the Jordan
   Valley.^[60]^[61]

   Arafat rejected this offer.^[58]^[62]^[63]^[64]^[65]^[66] According to the
   Palestinian negotiators the offer did not remove many of the elements of
   the Israeli occupation regarding land, security, settlements, and
   Jerusalem.^[67] President Clinton reportedly requested that Arafat make a
   counter-offer, but he proposed none. Former Israeli Foreign Minister
   Shlomo Ben-Ami who kept a diary of the negotiations said in an interview
   in 2001, when asked whether the Palestinians made a counterproposal: "No.
   And that is the heart of the matter. Never, in the negotiations between us
   and the Palestinians, was there a Palestinian counterproposal."^[68] In a
   separate interview in 2006 Ben Ami stated that were he a Palestinian he
   would have rejected the Camp David offer.^[69]

   No tenable solution was crafted which would satisfy both Israeli and
   Palestinian demands, even under intense US pressure. Clinton has long
   blamed Arafat for the collapse of the summit.^[70] In the months following
   the summit, Clinton appointed former US Senator George J. Mitchell to lead
   a fact-finding committee aiming to identify strategies for restoring the
   peace process. The committee's findings were published in 2001 with the
   dismantlement of existing Israeli settlements and Palestinian crackdown on
   militant activity being one strategy.^[71]

  Developments following Camp David

   Following the failed summit Palestinian and Israeli negotiators continued
   to meet in small groups through August and September 2000 to try to bridge
   the gaps between their respective positions. The United States prepared
   its own plan to resolve the outstanding issues. Clinton's presentation of
   the US proposals was delayed by the advent of the Second Intifada at the
   end of September.^[67]

   Clinton's plan, eventually presented on 23 December 2000, proposed the
   establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state in the Gaza strip and 94–96
   percent of the West Bank plus the equivalent of 1–3 percent of the West
   Bank in land swaps from pre-1967 Israel. On Jerusalem, the plan stated
   that "the general principle is that Arab areas are Palestinian and that
   Jewish areas are Israeli." The holy sites were to be split on the basis
   that Palestinians would have sovereignty over the Temple Mount/Noble
   sanctuary, while the Israelis would have sovereignty over the Western
   Wall. On refugees the plan suggested a number of proposals including
   financial compensation, the right of return to the Palestinian state, and
   Israeli acknowledgment of suffering caused to the Palestinians in 1948.
   Security proposals referred to a "non-militarized" Palestinian state, and
   an international force for border security. Both sides accepted Clinton's
   plan^[67]^[72]^[73] and it became the basis for the negotiations at the
   Taba Peace summit the following January.^[67]

  Taba Summit (2001)

   Main article: Taba Summit

   The Israeli negotiation team presented a new map at the Taba Summit in
   Taba, Egypt, in January 2001. The proposition removed the "temporarily
   Israeli controlled" areas, and the Palestinian side accepted this as a
   basis for further negotiation. With Israeli elections looming the talks
   ended without an agreement but the two sides issued a joint statement
   attesting to the progress they had made: "The sides declare that they have
   never been closer to reaching an agreement and it is thus our shared
   belief that the remaining gaps could be bridged with the resumption of
   negotiations following the Israeli elections." The following month the
   Likud party candidate Ariel Sharon defeated Ehud Barak in the Israeli
   elections and was elected as Israeli prime minister on 7 February 2001.
   Sharon's new government chose not to resume the high-level talks.^[67]

   One peace proposal, presented by the Quartet of the European Union,
   Russia, the United Nations and the United States on 17 September 2002, was
   the Road Map for Peace. This plan did not attempt to resolve difficult
   questions such as the fate of Jerusalem or Israeli settlements, but left
   that to be negotiated in later phases of the process. The proposal never
   made it beyond the first phase, whose goals called for a halt to both
   Israeli settlement construction and Israeli–Palestinian violence. Neither
   goal has been achieved as of November 2015.^[74]^[75]^[76]

  Arab Peace Initiative (2002, 2007, 2017)

   Main article: Arab Peace Initiative

   The Arab Peace Initiative (Arabic: مبادرة السلام العربية Mubādirat
   as-Salām al-ʿArabīyyah), also known as the Saudi Initiative, was first
   proposed by Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia at the Beirut Summit
   (2002). The peace initiative is a proposed solution to the Arab–Israeli
   conflict as a whole, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in
   particular.^[77] The initiative was initially published on 28 March 2002,
   at the Beirut Summit, and agreed upon again in 2007 in the Riyadh Summit.
   Unlike the Road Map for Peace, it spelled out "final-solution" borders
   based explicitly on the UN borders established before the 1967 Six-Day
   War. It offered full normalization of relations with Israel, in exchange
   for the withdrawal of its forces from all the occupied territories,
   including the Golan Heights, to recognize "an independent Palestinian
   state with East Jerusalem as its capital" in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
   as well as a "just solution" for the Palestinian refugees.^[78]

   The Palestinian Authority led by Yasser Arafat immediately embraced the
   initiative.^[79] His successor Mahmoud Abbas also supported the plan and
   officially asked U.S. President Barack Obama to adopt it as part of his
   Middle East policy.^[80] Islamist political party Hamas, the elected
   government of the Gaza Strip, was deeply divided,^[81] with most factions
   rejecting the plan.^[82] Palestinians have criticised the Israel–United
   Arab Emirates normalization agreement and another with Bahrain signed in
   September 2020, fearing the moves weaken the Arab Peace Initiative,
   regarding the UAE's move as "a betrayal."^[83]

   The Israeli government under Ariel Sharon rejected the initiative as a
   "non-starter"^[84] because it required Israel to withdraw to pre-June 1967
   borders.^[85] After the renewed Arab League endorsement in 2007,
   then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert gave a cautious welcome to the plan.^[86]
   In 2015, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed tentative
   support for the Initiative,^[87] but in 2018, he rejected it as a basis
   for future negotiations with the Palestinians.^[88]

Current status

   Main articles: Israeli–Palestinian peace process and Israel and apartheid

   The peace process has been predicated on a "two-state solution" thus far,
   but questions have been raised towards both sides' resolve to end the
   dispute.^[89] An article by S. Daniel Abraham, an American entrepreneur
   and founder of the Center for Middle East Peace in Washington, US,
   published on the website of the Atlantic magazine in March 2013, cited the
   following statistics: "Right now, the total number of Jews and Arabs
   living... in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza is just under 12 million
   people. At the moment, a shade under 50 percent of the population is
   Jewish."^[90]

   In April 2021, Human Rights Watch released its report A Threshold Crossed,
   making accusations that the policies of Israel towards Palestinians living
   in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza constituted the crime of apartheid.^[91]
   A further report titled Israel's Apartheid Against Palestinians: Cruel
   System of Domination and Crime Against Humanity was released by Amnesty
   International on 1 February 2022.^[92]

  Israel's settlements policy

   [IMG]Israeli settlers in Hebron, West Bank

   Israel has had its settlement growth and policies in the Palestinian
   territories harshly criticized by the European Union citing it as
   increasingly undermining the viability of the two-state solution and
   running in contrary to the Israeli-stated commitment to resume
   negotiations.^[93]^[94] In December 2011, all the regional groupings on
   the UN Security Council named continued settlement construction and
   settler violence as disruptive to the resumption of talks, a call viewed
   by Russia as a "historic step".^[95]^[96]^[97] In April 2012,
   international outrage followed Israeli steps to further entrench the
   Jewish settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which
   included the publishing of tenders for further settler homes and the plan
   to legalize settler outposts. Britain said that the move was a breach of
   Israeli commitments under the road map to freeze all settlement expansion
   in the land captured since 1967. The British Foreign Minister stated that
   the "Systematic, illegal Israeli settlement activity poses the most
   significant and live threat to the viability of the two state
   solution".^[98] In May 2012 the 27 foreign ministers of the European Union
   issued a statement which condemned continued Israeli settler violence and
   incitement.^[99] In a similar move, the Quartet "expressed its concern
   over ongoing settler violence and incitement in the West Bank," calling on
   Israel "to take effective measures, including bringing the perpetrators of
   such acts to justice."^[100] The Palestinian Ma'an News agency reported
   the PA Cabinet's statement on the issue stated that the West, including
   East Jerusalem, were seeing "an escalation in incitement and settler
   violence against our people with a clear protection from the occupation
   military. The last of which was the thousands of settler march in East
   Jerusalem which included slogans inciting to kill, hate and supports
   violence".^[101]

  Israeli Military Police

   May 2022

   In a report published in February 2014 covering incidents over the
   three-year period of 2011–2013, Amnesty International asserted that
   Israeli forces employed reckless violence in the West Bank, and in some
   instances appeared to engage in wilful killings which would be tantamount
   to war crimes. Besides the numerous fatalities, Amnesty said at least 261
   Palestinians, including 67 children, had been gravely injured by Israeli
   use of live ammunition. In this same period, 45 Palestinians, including 6
   children had been killed. Amnesty's review of 25 civilians deaths
   concluded that in no case was there evidence of the Palestinians posing an
   imminent threat. At the same time, over 8,000 Palestinians suffered
   serious injuries from other means, including rubber-coated metal bullets.
   Only one IDF soldier was convicted, killing a Palestinian attempting to
   enter Israel illegally. The soldier was demoted and given a 1-year
   sentence with a five-month suspension. The IDF answered the charges
   stating that its army held itself "to the highest of professional
   standards", adding that when there was suspicion of wrongdoing, it
   investigated and took action "where appropriate".^[102]^[103]

  Incitement

   Following the Oslo Accords, which was to set up regulative bodies to rein
   in frictions, Palestinian incitement against Israel, Jews, and Zionism
   continued, parallel with Israel's pursuance of settlements in the
   Palestinian territories,^[104] though under Abu Mazen it has reportedly
   dwindled significantly.^[105] Charges of incitement have been
   reciprocal,^[106]^[107] both sides interpreting media statements in the
   Palestinian and Israeli press as constituting incitement.^[105]
   Schoolbooks published for both Israeli and Palestinian schools have been
   found to have encouraged one-sided narrative and even hatred of the other
   side.^[108]^[109]^[110]^[111]^[112]^[113] Perpetrators of murderous
   attacks, whether against Israelis or Palestinians, often find strong vocal
   support from sections of their communities despite varying levels of
   condemnation from politicians.^[114]^[115]^[116]

   Both parties to the conflict have been criticized by third-parties for
   teaching incitement to their children by downplaying each side's
   historical ties to the area, teaching propagandist maps, or indoctrinate
   their children to one day join the armed forces.^[117]^[118]

     Countries that have not recognised the State of Palestine

   The PLO have campaigned for full member status for the state of Palestine
   at the UN and for recognition on the 1967 borders. The campaign has
   received widespread support,^[119]^[120] although it has been criticised
   by the US and Israel for allegedly avoiding bilateral
   negotiation.^[121]^[122] Netanyahu has criticized the Palestinians of
   purportedly trying to bypass direct talks,^[123] whereas Abbas has argued
   that the continued construction of Israeli-Jewish settlements is
   "undermining the realistic potential" for the two-state solution.^[124]
   Although Palestine has been denied full member status by the UN Security
   Council,^[125] in late 2012 the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly
   approved the de facto recognition of sovereign Palestine by granting
   non-member state status.^[126]

  Public attitudes towards peace

   Polling data has produced mixed results regarding the level of support
   among Palestinians for the two-state solution. A poll was carried out in
   2011 by the Hebrew University; it indicated that support for a two-state
   solution was growing among both Israelis and Palestinians. The poll found
   that 58% of Israelis and 50% of Palestinians supported a two-state
   solution based on the Clinton Parameters, compared with 47% of Israelis
   and 39% of Palestinians in 2003, the first year the poll was carried out.
   The poll also found that an increasing percentage of both populations
   supported an end to violence—63% of Palestinians and 70% of Israelis
   expressing their support for an end to violence, an increase of 2% for
   Israelis and 5% for Palestinians from the previous year.^[127]

Issues in dispute

   The following outlined positions are the official positions of the two
   parties; however, it is important to note that neither side holds a single
   position. Both the Israeli and the Palestinian sides include both moderate
   and extremist bodies as well as dovish and hawkish bodies.

   One of the primary obstacles to resolving the Israeli–Palestinian conflict
   is a deep-set and growing distrust between its participants. Unilateral
   strategies and the rhetoric of hardline political factions, coupled with
   violence and incitements by civilians against one another, have fostered
   mutual embitterment and hostility and a loss of faith in the peace
   process. Support among Palestinians for Hamas is considerable, and as its
   members consistently call for the destruction of Israel and violence
   remains a threat,^[128] security becomes a prime concern for many
   Israelis. The expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank has led
   the majority of Palestinians to believe that Israel is not committed to
   reaching an agreement, but rather to a pursuit of establishing permanent
   control over this territory in order to provide that security.^[129]

  Status of Jerusalem

   Main article: Status of Jerusalem
   See also: Western Wall, Temple Mount, and Al-Aqsa Mosque
   [IMG]Greater Jerusalem, May 2006. CIA remote sensing map showing what the
   CIA regards as settlements, plus refugee camps, fences, and walls

   The control of Jerusalem is a particularly delicate issue, with each side
   asserting claims over the city. The three largest Abrahamic
   religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—hold Jerusalem as an important
   setting for their religious and historical narratives. Jerusalem is the
   holiest city for Judaism, being the former location of the Jewish temples
   on the Temple Mount and the capital of the ancient Israelite kingdom. For
   Muslims, Jerusalem is the third holiest site, being the location of Isra
   and Mi'raj event, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque. For Christians, Jerusalem is the
   site of Jesus' crucifixion and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

   The Israeli government, including the Knesset and Supreme Court, is
   located in the "new city" of West Jerusalem and has been since Israel's
   founding in 1948. After Israel captured the Jordanian-controlled East
   Jerusalem in the Six-Day War, it assumed complete administrative control
   of East Jerusalem. In 1980, Israel passed the Jerusalem Law declaring
   "Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of
   Israel."^[130]^[better source needed]

   Many countries do not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, with
   exceptions being the United States,^[131] and Russia.^[132] The majority
   of UN member states and most international organisations do not recognise
   Israel's claims to East Jerusalem which occurred after the 1967 Six-Day
   War, nor its 1980 Jerusalem Law proclamation.^[133] The International
   Court of Justice in its 2004 Advisory opinion on the "Legal Consequences
   of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory"
   described East Jerusalem as "occupied Palestinian territory".^[134]

   At the Camp David and Taba Summits in 2000–2001, the United States
   proposed a plan in which the Arab parts of Jerusalem would be given to the
   proposed Palestinian state while the Jewish parts of Jerusalem were given
   to Israel. All archaeological work under the Temple Mount would be jointly
   controlled by the Israeli and Palestinian governments. Both sides accepted
   the proposal in principle, but the summits ultimately failed.^[135]

  Holy sites and Jerusalem's Temple Mount

   [IMG]Panorama of the Western Wall with the Dome of the Rock (left) and
   al-Aqsa mosque (right) in the background

   Israel has concerns regarding the welfare of Jewish holy places under
   possible Palestinian control. When Jerusalem was under Jordanian control,
   no Jews were allowed to visit the Western Wall or other Jewish holy
   places, and the Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives was
   desecrated.^[135] Since 1975, Israel has banned Muslims from worshiping at
   Joseph's Tomb, a shrine considered sacred by both Jews and Muslims.
   Settlers established a yeshiva, installed a Torah scroll and covered the
   mihrab. During the Second Intifada the site was looted and
   burned.^[136]^[137] Israeli security agencies routinely monitor and arrest
   Jewish extremists that plan attacks, though many serious incidents have
   still occurred.^[138] Israel has allowed almost complete autonomy to the
   Muslim trust (Waqf) over the Temple Mount.^[135]

   Palestinians have voiced concerns regarding the welfare of Christian and
   Muslim holy places under Israeli control.^[139] Additionally, some
   Palestinian advocates have made statements alleging that the Western Wall
   Tunnel was re-opened with the intent of causing the mosque's
   collapse.^[140]

  Palestinian refugees

   Palestinian exodus
   [IMG]Palestinian refugees, 1948

   Palestinian refugees are people who lost both their homes and means of
   livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli conflict^[141] and the
   1967 Six-Day War.^[142] The number of Palestinians who fled or were
   expelled from Israel following its creation was estimated at 711,000 in
   1949.^[143] Descendants of these original Palestinian Refugees are also
   eligible for registration and services provided by the United Nations
   Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA),
   and as of 2010 number 4.7 million people.^[144] Between 350,000 and
   400,000 Palestinians were displaced during the 1967 Arab–Israeli
   war.^[142] A third of the refugees live in recognized refugee camps in
   Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The remainder
   live in and around the cities and towns of these host countries.^[141]

   Most of these people were born outside Israel, but are descendants of
   original Palestinian refugees.^[141] Palestinian negotiators, such as
   Yasser Arafat, have so far publicly insisted that refugees have a right to
   return to the places where they lived before 1948 and 1967, including
   those within the 1949 Armistice lines, citing the Universal Declaration of
   Human Rights and UN General Assembly Resolution 194 as evidence. However,
   according to reports of private peace negotiations with Israel they have
   countenanced the return of only 10,000 refugees and their families to
   Israel as part of a peace settlement. Mahmoud Abbas, the current Chairman
   of the Palestine Liberation Organization was reported to have said in
   private discussion that it is "illogical to ask Israel to take 5 million,
   or indeed 1 million. That would mean the end of Israel."^[145] In a
   further interview Abbas stated that he no longer had an automatic right to
   return to Safed in the northern Galilee where he was born in 1935. He
   later clarified that the remark was his personal opinion and not official
   policy.^[146]

   Palestinian and international authors have justified the right of return
   of the Palestinian refugees on several grounds:^[147]^[148]^[149] Several
   scholars included in the broader New Historians argue that the Palestinian
   refugees fled or were chased out or expelled by the actions of the
   Haganah, Lehi and Irgun, Zionist paramilitary groups.^[150]^[151] A number
   have also characterized this as an ethnic
   cleansing.^[152]^[153]^[154]^[155] The New Historians cite indications of
   Arab leaders' desire for the Palestinian Arab population to stay
   put.^[156]

   [IMG]Home in Balata refugee camp demolished during the second Intifada,

   The Israeli Law of Return that grants citizenship to people of Jewish
   descent is viewed by critics as discriminatory against other ethnic
   groups, especially Palestinians that cannot apply for such citizenship
   under the law of return, to the territory which they were expelled from or
   fled during the course of the 1948 war.^[157]^[158]^[159]

   According to the UN Resolution 194, adopted in 1948, "the refugees wishing
   to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be
   permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation
   should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for
   loss of or damage to property which, under principles of international law
   or in equity, should be made good by the Governments or authorities
   responsible."^[160] UN Resolution 3236 "reaffirms also the inalienable
   right of the Palestinians to return to their homes and property from which
   they have been displaced and uprooted, and calls for their return".^[161]
   Resolution 242 from the UN affirms the necessity for "achieving a just
   settlement of the refugee problem"; however, Resolution 242 does not
   specify that the "just settlement" must or should be in the form of a
   literal Palestinian right of return.^[162]

   The most common arguments for opposition are:

    1. On the 18 August 1948, at the United Nations Security Council, Israel
       declared that it is not reasonable to contemplate a return of the
       refugees as the Arab League and the Arab High Committee have announced
       their intentions to continue their war of aggression and resume
       hostilities, noting that the state of war has not been lifted and that
       no peace treaty has been signed. However, Israel accepted the next
       year the return of some of the refugees, notably through the
       annexation of the Gaza Strip or by absorbing 100.000 of them in
       exchange of a peace treaty. The Arab countries refused the proposal,
       demanding a complete return.^[163]
    2. The Palestinian refugee issue is handled by a separate authority from
       that handling other refugees, that is, by UNRWA and not the UNHCR.
       Most of the people recognizing themselves as Palestinian refugees
       would have otherwise been assimilated into their country of current
       residency, and would not maintain their refugee state if not for the
       separate entities.^[164]
    3. Concerning the origin of the Palestinian refugees, the Israeli
       government said that during the 1948 War the Arab Higher Committee and
       the Arab states encouraged Palestinians to flee in order to make it
       easier to rout the Jewish state or that they did so to escape the
       fights by fear.^[citation needed] The Palestinian narrative is that
       refugees were largely expelled and dispossessed by Jewish militias and
       by the Israeli army.

   Historians still debate the causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus.
   Notably, historian Benny Morris states that most of Palestine's 700,000
   refugees fled because of the "flail of war" and expected to return home
   shortly after a successful Arab invasion. He documents instances in which
   Arab leaders advised the evacuation of entire communities as happened in
   Haifa. In his scholarly work, however, he does conclude that there were
   expulsions which were carried out.^[165]^[166] Morris considers the
   displacement the result of a national conflict initiated by the Arabs
   themselves.^[166] In a 2004 interview with Haaretz, he described the
   exodus as largely resulting from an atmosphere of transfer that was
   promoted by Ben-Gurion and understood by the military leadership. He also
   claimed that there "are circumstances in history that justify ethnic
   cleansing".^[167] He has been criticized by political scientist Norman
   Finkelstein for having seemingly changed his views for political, rather
   than historical, reasons.^[168]

   Since Jewish people who fled or otherwise emigrated from the Arab world
   after the Israeli declaration of independence were never compensated or
   repatriated by their former countries of residence—to no objection on the
   part of Arab leaders—a precedent has been set whereby it is the
   responsibility of the nation which accepts the refugees to assimilate
   them.^[169]^[170]^[171]

   [IMG]Shatila refugee camp on the outskirts of Beirut in May 2019

   Although Israel accepts the right of the Palestinian Diaspora to return
   into a new Palestinian state, Israel insists that the return of this
   population into the current state of Israel would be a great danger for
   the stability of the Jewish state; an influx of Palestinian refugees would
   lead to the destruction of the state of Israel.^[172]

   According to Efraim Karsh the Palestinians were themselves the aggressors
   in the 1948–1949 war who attempted to "cleanse" a neighboring ethnic
   community. Had the United Nations resolution of 29 November 1947
   recommending partition in Palestine not been subverted by force by the
   Arab world, there would have been no refugee problem in the first place.
   He reports of large numbers of Palestinian refugees leaving even before
   the outbreak of the 1948 war because of disillusionment and economic
   privation. The British High Commissioner for Palestine spoke of the
   "collapsing Arab morale in Palestine" that he partially attributed to the
   "increasing tendency of those who should be leading them to leave the
   country" and the considerable evacuations of the Arab effendi class. Huge
   numbers of Palestinians were also expelled by their leadership to prevent
   them from becoming Israeli citizens and in Haifa and Tiberias, tens of
   thousands of Arabs were forcibly evacuated on the instructions of the Arab
   Higher Committee.^[173]

  Israeli security concerns

   [IMG]Remains of an Egged bus hit by suicide bomber in the aftermath of the
   2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks. Eight people were killed, about
   40 were injured.

   Throughout the conflict, Palestinian violence has been a concern for
   Israelis. Israel,^[174] along with the United
   States^[175]^[better source needed] and the European Union, refer to the
   violence against Israeli civilians and military forces by Palestinian
   militants as terrorism. The motivations behind Palestinian violence
   against Israeli civilians are many, and not all violent Palestinian groups
   agree with each other on specifics. Nonetheless, a common motive is the
   desire to destroy Israel and replace it with a Palestinian Arab
   state.^[176] The most prominent Islamist groups, such as Hamas and
   Palestinian Islamic Jihad, view the Israeli–Palestinian conflict as a
   religious jihad.^[177]

   Suicide bombings have been used as a tactic among Palestinian
   organizations like Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade
   and certain suicide attacks have received support among Palestinians as
   high as 84%.^[178]^[179] In Israel, Palestinian suicide bombers have
   targeted civilian buses, restaurants, shopping malls, hotels and
   marketplaces.^[180] From 1993 to 2003, 303 Palestinian suicide bombers
   attacked Israel.

   The Israeli government initiated the construction of a security barrier
   following scores of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks in July 2003.
   Israel's coalition government approved the security barrier in the
   northern part of the green line between Israel and the West Bank.
   According to the IDF, since the erection of the fence, terrorist acts have
   declined by approximately 90%.^[181]

   Since 2001, the threat of Qassam rockets fired from Palestinian
   territories into Israel continues to be of great concern for Israeli
   defense officials.^[182] In 2006—the year following Israel's disengagement
   from the Gaza Strip—the Israeli government claimed to have recorded 1,726
   such launches, more than four times the total rockets fired in
   2005.^[174]^[183] As of January 2009, over 8,600 rockets have been
   launched,^[184]^[185] causing widespread psychological trauma and
   disruption of daily life.^[186] Over 500 rockets and mortars hit Israel in
   January–September 2010 and over 1,947 rockets hit Israel in
   January–November 2012.

   According to a study conducted by University of Haifa, one in five
   Israelis have lost a relative or friend in a Palestinian terrorist
   attack.^[187]

   There is significant debate within Israel about how to deal with the
   country's security concerns. Options have included military action
   (including targeted killings and house demolitions of terrorist
   operatives), diplomacy, unilateral gestures toward peace, and increased
   security measures such as checkpoints, roadblocks and security barriers.
   The legality and the wisdom of all of the above tactics have been called
   into question by various commentators.^[14]^[unreliable source?]

   Since mid-June 2007, Israel's primary means of dealing with security
   concerns in the West Bank has been to cooperate with and permit United
   States-sponsored training, equipping, and funding of the Palestinian
   Authority's security forces, which with Israeli help have largely
   succeeded in quelling West Bank supporters of Hamas.^[188]

  Palestinian violence outside of Israel

   Some Palestinians have committed violent acts over the globe on the
   pretext of a struggle against Israel.^[189]^[190]

   During the late 1960s, the PLO became increasingly infamous for its use of
   international terror. In 1969 alone, the PLO was responsible for hijacking
   82 planes. El Al Airlines became a regular hijacking target.^[191]^[192]
   The hijacking of Air France Flight 139 by the Popular Front for the
   Liberation of Palestine culminated during a hostage-rescue mission, where
   Israeli special forces successfully rescued the majority of the hostages.

   However, one of the most well-known and notorious terrorist acts was the
   capture and eventual murder of 11 Israeli athletes during the 1972 Olympic
   Games.^[193]

  Palestinian-on-Palestinian violence

   [IMG]A demonstration in support of Fatah in Gaza City in January 2013

   Fighting among rival Palestinian and Arab movements has played a crucial
   role in shaping Israel's security policy towards Palestinian militants, as
   well as in the Palestinian leadership's own policies.^[citation needed] As
   early as the 1930s revolts in Palestine, Arab forces fought each other
   while also skirmishing with Zionist and British forces, and internal
   conflicts continue to the present day. During the Lebanese Civil War,
   Palestinian baathists broke from the Palestine Liberation Organization and
   allied with the Shia Amal Movement, fighting a bloody civil war that
   killed thousands of Palestinians.^[194]^[195]

   In the First Intifada, more than a thousand Palestinians were killed in a
   campaign initiated by the Palestine Liberation Organization to crack down
   on suspected Israeli security service informers and collaborators. The
   Palestinian Authority was strongly criticized for its treatment of alleged
   collaborators, rights groups complaining that those labeled collaborators
   were denied fair trials. According to a report released by the Palestinian
   Human Rights Monitoring Group, less than 45 percent of those killed were
   actually guilty of informing for Israel.^[196]

   In the Gaza Strip, Hamas officials have tortured and killed thousands of
   Fatah members and other Palestinians who oppose their rule. During the
   Battle of Gaza, more than 150 Palestinians died over a four-day
   period.^[197] The violence among Palestinians was described as a civil war
   by some commentators. By 2007, more than 600 Palestinian people had died
   during the struggle between Hamas and Fatah.^[198]

   [IMG]Area C, controlled by Israel under Oslo Accords, in blue and red, in
   December 2011

   As far as Israel is concerned, the jurisdiction of the Palestinian
   Authority is derived from the Oslo Accords, signed with the PLO, under
   which it acquired control over cities in the Palestinian territories (Area
   A) while the surrounding countryside came either under Israeli security
   and Palestinian civil administration (Area B) or complete Israeli civil
   administration (Area C). Israel has built additional highways to allow
   Israelis to traverse the area without entering Palestinian cities in Area
   A. The initial areas under Palestinian Authority control are diverse and
   non-contiguous. The areas have changed over time by subsequent
   negotiations, including Oslo II, Wye River and Sharm el-Sheik. According
   to Palestinians, the separated areas make it impossible to create a viable
   nation and fails to address Palestinian security needs; Israel has
   expressed no agreement to withdrawal from some Areas B, resulting in no
   reduction in the division of the Palestinian areas, and the institution of
   a safe pass system, without Israeli checkpoints, between these parts.

   Under the Oslo Accords, as a security measure, Israel has insisted on its
   control over all land, sea and air border crossings into the Palestinian
   territories, and the right to set import and export controls. This is to
   enable Israel to control the entry into the territories of materials of
   military significance and of potentially dangerous persons.

   The PLO's objective for international recognition of the State of
   Palestine is considered by Israel as a provocative "unilateral" act that
   is inconsistent with the Oslo Accords.

  Water resources

   Further information: Water supply and sanitation in the Palestinian
   territories and Water politics in the Jordan River basin

   In the Middle East, water resources are of great political concern. Since
   Israel receives much of its water from two large underground aquifers
   which continue under the Green Line, the use of this water has been
   contentious in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Israel withdraws most
   water from these areas, but it also supplies the West Bank with
   approximately 40 million cubic metres annually, contributing to 77% of
   Palestinians' water supply in the West Bank, which is to be shared for a
   population of about 2.6 million.^[199]

   [IMG]Palestinian villagers purchase water from water trucks in Khirbet
   A-Duqaiqah in the Hebron Hills [IMG]A swimming pool in the Israeli
   settlement of Ma'ale Adumim, West Bank

   While Israel's consumption of this water has decreased since it began its
   occupation of the West Bank, it still consumes the majority of it: in the
   1950s, Israel consumed 95% of the water output of the Western Aquifer, and
   82% of that produced by the Northeastern Aquifer. Although this water was
   drawn entirely on Israel's own side of the pre-1967 border, the sources of
   the water are nevertheless from the shared groundwater basins located
   under both West Bank and Israel.^[200]

   In the Oslo II Accord, both sides agreed to maintain "existing quantities
   of utilization from the resources." In so doing, the Palestinian Authority
   established the legality of Israeli water production in the West Bank,
   subject to a Joint Water Committee (JWC). Moreover, Israel obligated
   itself in this agreement to provide water to supplement Palestinian
   production, and further agreed to allow additional Palestinian drilling in
   the Eastern Aquifer, also subject to the Joint Water
   Committee.^[201]^[202] The water that Israel receives comes mainly from
   the Jordan River system, the Sea of Galilee and two underground sources.
   According to a 2003 BBC article the Palestinians lack access to the Jordan
   River system.^[203]

   According to a report of 2008 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of
   the United Nations, water resources were confiscated for the benefit of
   the Israeli settlements in the Ghor. Palestinian irrigation pumps on the
   Jordan River were destroyed or confiscated after the 1967 war and
   Palestinians were not allowed to use water from the Jordan River system.
   Furthermore, the authorities did not allow any new irrigation wells to be
   drilled by Palestinian farmers, while it provided fresh water and allowed
   drilling wells for irrigation purposes at the Jewish settlements in the
   West Bank and Gaza Strip.^[204]

   A report was released by the UN in August 2012 and Max Gaylard, the UN
   Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in the occupied Palestinian
   territory, explained at the launch of the publication: "Gaza will have
   half a million more people by 2020 while its economy will grow only
   slowly. In consequence, the people of Gaza will have an even harder time
   getting enough drinking water and electricity, or sending their children
   to school". Gaylard present alongside Jean Gough, of the UN Children's
   Fund (UNICEF), and Robert Turner, of the UN Relief and Works Agency for
   Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The report projects that
   Gaza's population will increase from 1.6 million people to 2.1 million
   people in 2020, leading to a density of more than 5,800 people per square
   kilometre.^[205]

    Future and financing

   Numerous foreign nations and international organizations have established
   bilateral agreements with the Palestinian and Israeli water authorities.
   It was estimated that a future investment of about US$1.1bn for the West
   Bank and $0.8bn for the Gaza Strip Southern Governorates was needed for
   the planning period from 2003 to 2015.^[206]

   In late 2012, a donation of $21.6 million was announced by the Government
   of the Netherlands—the Dutch government stated that the funds would be
   provided to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the
   Near East (UNRWA), for the specific benefit of Palestinian children. An
   article, published by the UN News website, stated that: "Of the $21.6
   million, $5.7 will be allocated to UNRWA's 2012 Emergency Appeal for the
   occupied Palestinian territory, which will support programmes in the West
   Bank and Gaza aiming to mitigate the effects on refugees of the
   deteriorating situation they face."^[205]

  Israeli occupation of the West Bank

   See also: Israeli-occupied territories, West Bank § Status, Positions on
   Jerusalem, and Status of territories captured by Israel
   [IMG]Protest against land confiscation held at Bil'in, 2011

   Occupied Palestinian Territory is the term used by the United Nations to
   refer to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza
   Strip—territories which were captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day
   War, having formerly been controlled by Egypt and Jordan.^[207]

   In 1980, Israel annexed East Jerusalem.^[208] Israel has never annexed the
   West Bank, apart from East Jerusalem, or Gaza Strip, and the United
   Nations has demanded the "[t]ermination of all claims or states of
   belligerency and respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty,
   territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the
   area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized
   boundaries free from threats or acts of force" and that Israeli forces
   withdraw "from territories occupied in the recent conflict" – the meaning
   and intent of the latter phrase is disputed. See Interpretations.

   It has been the position of Israel that the most Arab-populated parts of
   West Bank (without major Jewish settlements), as well as the entire Gaza
   Strip, must eventually be part of an independent Palestinian State;
   however, the precise borders of this state are in question. At Camp David,
   for example, then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered Arafat an
   opportunity to establish a non-militarized Palestinian State. The proposed
   state would consist of 77% of the West Bank split into two or three areas,
   followed by: an increase of 86–91% of the West Bank after six to
   twenty-one years; autonomy, but not sovereignty for some of the Arab
   neighborhoods of East Jerusalem surrounded by Israeli territory; the
   entire Gaza Strip; and the dismantling of most settlements.^[61] Arafat
   rejected the proposal without providing a counter-offer.

   A subsequent settlement proposed by President Clinton offered Palestinian
   sovereignty over 94 to 96 percent of the West Bank but was similarly
   rejected with 52 objections.^[60]^[209]^[210]^[12] The Arab League has
   agreed to the principle of minor and mutually agreed land-swaps as part of
   a negotiated two state settlement based in June 1967 borders.^[211]
   Official U.S. policy also reflects the ideal of using the 1967 borders as
   a basis for an eventual peace agreement.^[212]^[213]

   Some Palestinians say they are entitled to all of the West Bank, Gaza
   Strip, and East Jerusalem. Israel says it is justified in not ceding all
   this land, because of security concerns, and also because the lack of any
   valid diplomatic agreement at the time means that ownership and boundaries
   of this land is open for discussion.^[214] Palestinians claim any
   reduction of this claim is a severe deprivation of their rights. In
   negotiations, they claim that any moves to reduce the boundaries of this
   land is a hostile move against their key interests. Israel considers this
   land to be in dispute and feels the purpose of negotiations is to define
   what the final borders will be. In 2017 Hamas announced that it was ready
   to support a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders "without recognising
   Israel or ceding any rights".^[215] Hamas has previously viewed the peace
   process "as religiously forbidden and politically inconceivable".^[177]

    Israeli settlements

   Main article: Israeli settlement
   [IMG]A neighbourhood in Ariel, home to the Ariel University

   According to the Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Affairs
   (DEMA), "In the years following the Six-Day War, and especially in the
   1990s during the peace process, Israel re-established communities
   destroyed in 1929 and 1948 as well as established numerous new settlements
   in the West Bank."^[216] These settlements were, as of 2009, home to about
   301,000 people.^[217] DEMA added, "Most of the settlements are in the
   western parts of the West Bank, while others are deep into Palestinian
   territory, overlooking Palestinian cities. These settlements have been the
   site of much inter-communal conflict."^[216] The issue of Israeli
   settlements in the West Bank and, until 2005, the Gaza Strip, have been
   described by the UK^[218] and the WEU^[219] as an obstacle to the peace
   process. The United Nations and the European Union have also called the
   settlements "illegal under international law."^[220]^[221]

   However, Israel disputes this;^[222] several scholars and commentators
   disagree with the assessment that settlements are illegal, citing in 2005
   recent historical trends to back up their argument.^[223]^[224] Those who
   justify the legality of the settlements use arguments based upon Articles
   2 and 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, as well as UN Security Council
   Resolution 242.^[225]^[better source needed] On a practical level, some
   objections voiced by Palestinians are that settlements divert resources
   needed by Palestinian towns, such as arable land, water, and other
   resources; and, that settlements reduce Palestinians' ability to travel
   freely via local roads, owing to security considerations.^[citation
   needed]

   Former US President George W. Bush has stated that he does not expect
   Israel to return entirely to the 1949 armistice lines because of "new
   realities on the ground".^[226] One of the main compromise plans put forth
   by the Clinton Administration would have allowed Israel to keep some
   settlements in the West Bank, especially those which were in large blocs
   near the pre-1967 borders of Israel. In return, Palestinians would have
   received some concessions of land in other parts of the country.^[citation
   needed] The Obama administration viewed a complete freeze of construction
   in settlements on the West Bank as a critical step toward peace. In May
   and June 2009, President Barack Obama said, "The United States does not
   accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements",^[227] and the
   Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, stated that the President "wants to
   see a stop to settlements—not some settlements, not outposts, not 'natural
   growth' exceptions."^[228] However, Obama has since declared that the
   United States will no longer press Israel to stop West Bank settlement
   construction as a precondition for continued peace-process negotiations
   with the Palestinian Authority.^[229]

   As of 2023, there were about 500,000 Israeli settlers living in the West
   Bank, with another 200,000 living in East Jerusalem.^[230]^[231]^[232] In
   February 2023, Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich took charge of
   most of the Civil Administration, obtaining broad authority over civilian
   issues in the West Bank.^[233]^[234] In the first six months of 2023,
   13,000 housing units were built in settlements, which is almost three
   times more than in the whole of 2022.^[235]

  Blockade of the Gaza Strip

   Main article: Blockade of the Gaza Strip
   [IMG]Israel's attack on Gaza in 2009

   The Israeli government states it is justified under international law to
   impose a blockade on an enemy for security reasons. The power to impose a
   naval blockade is established under customary international law and Laws
   of armed conflict, and a United Nations commission has ruled that Israel's
   blockade is "both legal and appropriate."^[236]^[237] The Israeli
   Government's continued land, sea and air blockage is tantamount to
   collective punishment of the population, according to the United Nations
   Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.^[238] The Military
   Advocate General of Israel has provided numerous reasonings for the
   policy:

     The State of Israel has been engaged in an ongoing armed conflict with
     terrorist organizations operating in the Gaza strip. This armed conflict
     has intensified after Hamas violently took over Gaza, in June 2007, and
     turned the territory under its de facto control into a launching pad of
     mortar and rocket attacks against Israeli towns and villages in southern
     Israel.^[239]

   According to Oxfam, because of an import-export ban imposed on Gaza in
   2007, 95% of Gaza's industrial operations were suspended. Out of 35,000
   people employed by 3,900 factories in June 2005, only 1,750 people
   remained employed by 195 factories in June 2007.^[240] By 2010, Gaza's
   unemployment rate had risen to 40% with 80% of the population living on
   less than 2 dollars a day.^[241]

   [IMG]Rocket attacks fired at Israel from the Gaza Strip, 2001-2021^[242]

   In January 2008, the Israeli government calculated how many calories per
   person were needed to prevent a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza strip, and
   then subtracted eight percent to adjust for the "culture and experience"
   of the Gazans. Details of the calculations were released following Israeli
   human rights organization Gisha's application to the high court. Israel's
   Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, who drafted the
   plan, stated that the scheme was never formally adopted, this was not
   accepted by Gisha.^[243]^[244]^[245]

   Starting in February 2008, the Israeli Government reduced the electricity
   it sells directly to Gaza. This follows the ruling of Israel's High Court
   of Justice's decision, which held, with respect to the amount of
   industrial fuel supplied to Gaza, that, "The clarification that we made
   indicates that the supply of industrial diesel fuel to the Gaza Strip in
   the winter months of last year was comparable to the amount that the
   Respondents now undertake to allow into the Gaza Strip. This fact also
   indicates that the amount is reasonable and sufficient to meet the vital
   humanitarian needs in the Gaza Strip." Palestinian militants killed two
   Israelis in the process of delivering fuel to the Nahal Oz fuel
   depot.^[246]

   With regard to Israel's plan, the Court stated that, "calls for a
   reduction of five percent of the power supply in three of the ten power
   lines that supply electricity from Israel to the Gaza Strip, to a level of
   13.5 megawatts in two of the lines and 12.5 megawatts in the third line,
   we [the Court] were convinced that this reduction does not breach the
   humanitarian obligations imposed on the State of Israel in the framework
   of the armed conflict being waged between it and the Hamas organization
   that controls the Gaza Strip. Our conclusion is based, in part, on the
   affidavit of the Respondents indicating that the relevant Palestinian
   officials stated that they can reduce the load in the event limitations
   are placed on the power lines, and that they had used this capability in
   the past."

   On 20 June 2010, Israel's Security Cabinet approved a new system governing
   the blockade that would allow practically all non-military or dual-use
   items to enter the Gaza strip. According to a cabinet statement, Israel
   would "expand the transfer of construction materials designated for
   projects that have been approved by the Palestinian Authority, including
   schools, health institutions, water, sanitation and more – as well as
   (projects) that are under international supervision."^[247] Despite the
   easing of the land blockade, Israel will continue to inspect all goods
   bound for Gaza by sea at the port of Ashdod.^[248]

   [IMG]Palestinian protesters in the Gaza Strip during the 2023 Israel–Hamas
   war

   Prior to a Gaza visit, scheduled for April 2013, Turkey's Prime Minister
   Recep Tayyip Erdogan explained to Turkish newspaper Hürriyet that the
   fulfilment of three conditions by Israel was necessary for friendly
   relations to resume between Turkey and Israel: an apology for the May 2010
   Gaza flotilla raid (Prime Minister Netanyahu had delivered an apology to
   Erdogan by telephone on 22 March 2013), the awarding of compensation to
   the families affected by the raid, and the lifting of the Gaza blockade by
   Israel. The Turkish prime minister also explained in the Hürriyet
   interview, in relation to the April 2013 Gaza visit, "We will monitor the
   situation to see if the promises are kept or not."^[249] At the same time,
   Netanyahu affirmed that Israel would only consider exploring the removal
   of the Gaza blockade if peace ("quiet") is achieved in the area.^[250]

   On 9 October 2023, Israel declared war on Hamas and imposed a "total
   blockade" of the Gaza Strip.^[251] The blockade was announced by Israeli
   Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who declared: "There will be no
   electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed. We are fighting human
   animals and we are acting accordingly."^[252]^[253]

  Agricultural rights

   See also: Economy of the State of Palestine § Israeli–Palestinian
   relations

   Since the beginning of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, the conflict has
   been about land.^[254] When Israel became a state after the war in 1948,
   77% of Palestine's land was used for the creation on the state.^[255] The
   majority of those living in Palestine at the time became refugees in other
   countries and this first land crisis became the root of the
   Israeli–Palestinian conflict.^[256] Because the root of the conflict is
   with land, the disputes between Israel and Palestine are well-manifested
   in the agriculture of Palestine.

   In Palestine, agriculture is a mainstay in the economy. The production of
   agricultural goods supports the population's sustenance needs and fuels
   Palestine's export economy.^[257] According to the Council for European
   Palestinian Relations, the agricultural sector formally employs 13.4% of
   the population and informally employs 90% of the population.^[257] Over
   the past 10 years^[when?], unemployment rates in Palestine have increased
   and the agricultural sector became the most impoverished sector in
   Palestine. Unemployment rates peaked in 2008 when they reached 41% in
   Gaza.^[258]

   Palestinian agriculture suffers from numerous problems including Israeli
   military and civilian attacks on farms and farmers, blockades to
   exportation of produce and importation of necessary inputs, widespread
   confiscation of land for nature reserves as well as military and settler
   use, confiscation and destruction of wells, and physical barriers within
   the West Bank.^[259]

  Israel's West Bank barrier

   [IMG]The barrier between Israel and Palestine

   With the construction of the separation barrier, the Israeli state
   promised free movement across regions. However, border closures, curfews,
   and checkpoints has significantly restricted Palestinian movement.^[260]
   In 2012, there were 99 fixed check points and 310 flying
   checkpoints.^[261] The border restrictions impacted the imports and
   exports in Palestine and weakened the industrial and agricultural sectors
   because of the constant Israeli control in the West Bank and Gaza.^[262]
   In order for the Palestinian economy to be prosperous, the restrictions on
   Palestinian land must be removed.^[259] According to The Guardian and a
   report for World Bank, the Palestinian economy lost $3.4bn (%35 of the
   annual GDP) to Israeli restrictions in the West Bank alone.^[263]

  Economic disputes and boycotts

   See also: Economy of the Palestinian territories and Boycott, Divestment,
   and Sanctions

   In Gaza, the agricultural market suffers from economic boycotts and border
   closures and restrictions placed by Israel.^[264] The PA's Minister of
   Agriculture estimates that around US$1.2 billion were lost in September
   2006 because of these security measures. There has also been an economic
   embargo initiated by the west on Hamas-led Palestine, which has decreased
   the amount of imports and exports from Palestine.^[citation needed] This
   embargo was brought on by Hamas' refusal to recognize Israel's right to
   statehood.^[citation needed] s a result, the PA's 160,000 employees have
   not received their salaries in over one year.^[265]

Actions toward stabilizing the conflict

   In response to a weakening trend in Palestinian violence and growing
   economic and security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian
   Authority, the Israeli military removed over 120 check points in 2010 and
   planned on disengaging from major Palestinian population areas. According
   to the IDF, terrorist activity in the West Bank decreased by 97% compared
   to violence in 2002.^[266]

   PA–Israel efforts in the West Bank have "significantly increased investor
   confidence", and the Palestinian economy grew 6.8% in
   2009.^[267]^[268]^[269]^[270]

   [IMG]Bank of Palestine

   Since the Second Intifada, Israel has banned Jewish Israelis from entering
   Palestinian cities. However, Israeli Arabs are allowed to enter West Bank
   cities on weekends.

   The Palestinian Authority has petitioned the Israeli military to allow
   Jewish tourists to visit West Bank cities as "part of an effort" to
   improve the Palestinian economy. Israeli general Avi Mizrahi spoke with
   Palestinian security officers while touring malls and soccer fields in the
   West Bank. Mizrahi gave permission to allow Israeli tour guides into
   Bethlehem, a move intended to "contribute to the Palestinian and Israeli
   economies."^[271]

  Mutual recognition

   Main article: Israel–PLO Letters of Mutual Recognition

    Between Israel and the PLO

   Beginning in 1993 with the Oslo peace process, Israel recognizes "the PLO
   as the representative of the Palestinian people", though Israel does not
   recognize the State of Palestine.^[272] In return, it was agreed that
   Palestinians would promote peaceful co-existence, renounce violence and
   promote recognition of Israel among their own people. Despite Yasser
   Arafat's official renunciation of terrorism and recognition of Israel,
   some Palestinian groups continue to practice and advocate violence against
   civilians and do not recognize Israel as a legitimate political
   entity.^[26]^[273]^[unreliable source?] Palestinians state that their
   ability to spread acceptance of Israel was greatly hampered by Israeli
   restrictions on Palestinian political freedoms, economic freedoms, civil
   liberties, and quality of life.

    Of Israel as a Jewish state

   The Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas has in recent years refused to
   recognize Israel as a Jewish state, citing concerns for Israeli Arabs and
   a possible future right to return for Palestinian refugees, though
   Palestine continues to recognize Israel as a state.^[274]^[275]

    This article needs to be updated. Please help update this article to      
    reflect recent events or newly available information. (January 2023)      

   The leader of al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, which is Fatah's official
   military wing, has stated that any peace agreement must include the right
   of return of Palestinian refugees into lands now part of Israel, which
   some Israeli commenters view as "destroying the Jewish state".^[276] In
   2006, Hamas won a majority in the Palestinian Legislative Council, where
   it remains the majority party. Hamas' charter openly states they seek
   Israel's destruction, though Hamas leaders have spoken of long-term truces
   with Israel in exchange for an end to the occupation of Palestinian
   territory.^[273]^[277]

  Palestinian government

   [IMG]Palestinian enclaves in May 2023 (Area A and B under the Oslo II
   Accord). Area A (light yellow) is exclusively administered by the
   Fatah-controlled Palestinian Authority.

   The Palestinian Authority is considered corrupt by a wide variety of
   sources, including some Palestinians.^[278]^[279]^[280] Some Israelis
   argue that it provides tacit support for militants via its relationship
   with Hamas and other Islamic militant movements, and that therefore it is
   unsuitable for governing any putative Palestinian state or (especially
   according to the right wing of Israeli politics), even negotiating about
   the character of such a state.^[214] Because of that, a number of
   organizations, including the previously ruling Likud party, declared they
   would not accept a Palestinian state based on the current PA.

    Palestinian security apparatus

   Starting in 2006, the United States began training, equipping, and funding
   the Palestinian Authority's security forces, which had been cooperating
   with Israel at unprecedented levels in the West Bank to quell supporters
   of Hamas.^[188] The US government has spent over $500 million building and
   training the Palestinian National Security Forces and Presidential
   Guard.^[188] The IDF maintains that the US-trained forces will soon be
   capable of "overrunning small IDF outposts and isolated Israeli
   communities" in the event of a conflict.^[281]

  Views on dialogue versus violence

   Societal attitudes in both Israel and Palestine are a source of concern to
   those promoting dispute resolution.

   According to a June 2022 poll carried out by the Palestinian Center for
   Policy and Survey Research that asked Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and
   the West Bank including East Jerusalem, "which of the following means is
   the most effective means of ending the Israeli occupation and building an
   independent state", 50% supported "armed struggle", 22% favored
   negotiations until an agreement could be reached, and 21% supported
   non-violent popular resistance.^[18] 59% of respondents cite the armed
   attack inside Israel carried out by Palestinians unaffiliated with known
   armed groups as contributing to ending the occupation; 37% disagree.
   Residents of the Gaza Strip, youth, students, low-income workers, public
   sector employees, and Hamas supporters are more likely to believe that
   armed attacks contribute to the national interest.^[18] An unconditional
   resumption of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations is opposed by 69% of
   Palestinians and supported by 22%. A return to dialogue with the new US
   administration under Joe Biden is opposed by 65% of Palestinians, while
   29% are in favor.^[18]

Fatalities

   See also: Israeli casualties of war and Palestinian casualties of war

   A variety of studies provide aggregated casualty data for the
   Israeli–Palestinian conflict. According to the Stockholm International
   Peace Research Institute, 13,000 Israelis and Palestinians were killed in
   conflict with each other between 1948 and 1997.^[282] Other estimations
   give 14,500 killed between 1948 and 2009.^[282]^[283] Palestinian
   fatalities during the 1982 Lebanon War were 2,000 PLO combatants killed in
   armed conflict with Israel.^[284]

   According to B'tselem, during the first intifada from 1987 until 2000,
   1,551 Palestinians and 421 Israelis lost their lives.^[285] According to
   the database of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of
   Humanitarian Affairs - occupied Palestinian territory (OCHAoPt), 6,407
   Palestinians and 308 Israelis were killed in the ongoing
   Israeli–Palestinian conflict from 2008 to September 2023, before the 2023
   Israel–Hamas war.^[286]^[287]

   Figures include both Israeli civilians and security forces casualties in
   West Bank, Gaza and Israel. All numbers refer to casualties of direct
   conflict between Israelis and Palestinians including in IDF military
   operations, artillery shelling, search and arrest campaigns, barrier
   demonstrations, targeted killings, settler violence etc. The figures do
   not include events indirectly related to the conflict such as casualties
   from unexploded ordnance, etc., or events when the circumstances remain
   unclear or are in dispute. The figures include all reported casualties of
   all ages and both genders.^[289]

  Criticism of casualty statistics

   As reported by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, since 29 September
   2000 a total of 7,454 Palestinian and Israeli individuals were killed due
   to the conflict. According to the report, 1,317 of the 6,371 Palestinians
   were minors, and at least 2,996 did not participate in fighting at the
   time of death. Palestinians killed 1,083 Israelis, including 741
   civilians, of whom 124 were minors.^[291]

   The Israeli-based International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism
   criticized the methodology of Israeli and Palestinian rights groups,
   including B'Tselem, and questioned their accuracy in classifying
   civilian/combatant ratios.^[292]^[293]

  Landmines and unexploded ordnance

   A comprehensive collection mechanism to gather land mine and explosive
   remnants of war (ERW) casualty data does not exist for the Palestinian
   territories.^[294] In 2009, the United Nations Mine Action Centre reported
   that more than 2,500 mine and explosive remnants of war casualties
   occurred between 1967 and 1998, at least 794 casualties (127 killed, 654
   injured and 13 unknown) occurred between 1999 and 2008 and that 12 people
   had been killed and 27 injured since the Gaza War.^[294] The UN Mine
   Action Centre identified the main risks as coming from "ERW left behind by
   Israeli aerial and artillery weapon systems, or from militant caches
   targeted by the Israeli forces."^[294] There are at least 15 confirmed
   minefields in the West Bank on the border with Jordan. The Palestinian
   National Security Forces do not have maps or records of the
   minefields.^[294]

Notes

Explanatory notes

    1. ^ Three factors made Israel's territorial offer less forthcoming than
       it initially appeared. First, the 91 percent land offer was based on
       the Israeli definition of the West Bank, but this differs by
       approximately 5 percentage points from the Palestinian definition.
       Palestinians use a total area of 5,854 square kilometers. Israel,
       however, omits the area known as No Man's Land (50 km^2 near Latrun),
       post-1967 East Jerusalem (71 km^2), and the territorial waters of the
       Dead Sea (195 km^2), which reduces the total to 5,538 km^2. Thus, an
       Israeli offer of 91 percent (of 5,538 km^2 of the West Bank translates
       into only 86 percent from the Palestinian perspective.

        of South African Apartheid has its equivalent in Israel today.18 A
        significant example is the Law of Return (1950), which even Kretzmer
        claims is explicitly discriminatory against Palestinian citizens....
        The Law of Return, which determines the second-class citizenship of
        Palestinians, is recognized as a fundamental principle in Israel and
        "is possibly even its very raison d'etre as a Jewish state."19

        discriminatory effect for Palestinian Arab people since it allows any
        Jew to immigrate to Israel, while – at the same time – it deprives
        all native Palestinian Arab refugees residing outside the borders of
        the state of Israel of their fundamental right to return to their
        homes and villages from which they were expelled or took flight in
        the course of the 1948 war that broke out because of the
        establishment of Israel.

        heading of "Discrimination", the Committee cited Israel's Law of
        Return as discriminatory against Palestinian refugees because of
        Israel's refusal to readmit them. The committee said: "The Committee
        notes with concern that the Law of Return which permits any Jew from
        anywhere in the world to immigrate and thereby virtually
        automatically enjoy residence and obtain citizenship in Israel,
        discriminates against Palestinians in the Diaspora upon whom the
        Government of Israel has imposed restrictive requirements that make
        it almost impossible to return to their land of birth."

          delegation from the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the Madrid Peace
          Conferences in late October 1991 further fueled the tension between

          Jews, as religiously forbidden and politically inconceivable. (p.

   War film is a film genre concerned with warfare, typically about naval,
   air, or land battles, with combat scenes central to the drama.^[1]^[2]
   Themes explored include combat, survival and escape, camaraderie between
   soldiers, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the effects of
   war on society, and the moral and human issues raised by war. The stories
   told may be fiction, historical drama, or biographical.

   Subgenres, not necessarily distinct, include anti-war, comedy, propaganda,
   and documentary. There are similarly subgenres of the war film in specific
   theatres such as the Western Desert of North Africa and the Pacific in the
   Second World War, Vietnam, or the Soviet–Afghan War; and films set in
   specific domains of war, such as the infantry, the air, at sea, in
   submarines or at prisoner of war camps.

Genre[edit]

   Further information: List of war films

   The war film genre is not necessarily tightly defined: the American Film
   Institute, for example, speaks of "films to grapple with the Great War"
   without attempting to classify these.^[3] However, some directors and
   critics have offered at least tentative definitions. The director Sam
   Fuller defined the genre by saying that "a war film's objective, no matter
   how personal or emotional, is to make a viewer feel war."^[4] John Belton
   identified four narrative elements of the war film within the context of
   Hollywood production: a) the suspension of civilian morality during times
   of war, b) primacy of collective goals over individual motivations, c)
   rivalry between men in predominantly male groups as well as
   marginalization and objectification of women, and d) depiction of the
   reintegration of veterans.^[5] The fateful nature of battle scenes means
   that war films often end with them.^[6]

   [IMG]John Wayne in The Longest Day, 1962

   The film critic Stephen Neale suggests that the genre is for the most part
   well defined and uncontentious, since war films are simply those about war
   being waged in the 20th century, with combat scenes central to the drama.
   However, Neale notes, films set in the American Civil War or the American
   Indian Wars of the 19th century were called war films in the time before
   the First World War.^[1] The critic Julian Smith argues, on the contrary,
   that the war film lacks the formal boundaries of a genre like the Western,
   but that in practice, "successful and influential" war films are about
   modern wars, in particular World War II, with the combination of mobile
   forces and mass killing.^[2] The film scholar Kathryn Kane^[7] points out
   some similarities between the war film genre and the Western. Both genres
   use opposing concepts like war and peace, civilization and savagery. War
   films usually frame World War II as a conflict between "good" and "evil"
   as represented by the Allied forces and Nazi Germany whereas the Western
   portrays the conflict between civilized settlers and the savage indigenous
   peoples.^[8] James Clarke notes the similarity between a Western like Sam
   Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch and "war-movie escapades" like The Dirty
   Dozen.^[9]

   The film historian Jeanine Basinger states that she began with a
   preconception of what the war film genre would be, namely that:

     What I knew in advance was what presumably every member of our culture
     would know about World War II combat films—that they contained a hero, a
     group of mixed types [of people], and a military objective of some sort.
     They take place in the actual combat zones of World War II, against the
     established enemies, on the ground, the sea, or in the air. They contain
     many repeated events, such as mail call, all presented visually with
     appropriate uniforms, equipment, and iconography of battle.^[10]

   Further, Basinger considers Bataan to provide a definition-by-example of
   "the World War II combat film", in which a diverse and apparently unsuited
   group of "hastily assembled volunteers" hold off a much larger group of
   the enemy through their "bravery and tenacity".^[11] She argues that the
   combat film is not a subgenre but the only genuine kind of war film. Since
   she notes that there were in fact only five true combat films made during
   the Second World War, in her view these few films, central to the genre,
   are outweighed by the many other films that are only just war films.^[12]
   However, other critics such as Russell Earl Shain propose a far broader
   definition of war film, to include films that deal "with the roles of
   civilians, espionage agents, and soldiers in any of the aspects of war
   (i.e. preparation, cause, prevention, conduct, daily life, and
   consequences or aftermath.)"^[13] Neale points out that genres overlap,
   with combat scenes for different purposes in other types of film, and
   suggests that war films are characterised by combat which "determines the
   fate of the principal characters". This in turn pushes combat scenes to
   the climactic ends of war films.^[6] Not all critics agree, either, that
   war films must be about 20th-century wars. James Clarke includes Edward
   Zwick's Oscar-winning Glory (1990) among the war films he discusses in
   detail; it is set in the American Civil War, and he lists six other films
   about that war which he considers "notable".^[14]^[a] The screenwriter and
   scholar Eric R. Williams identifies war films as one of eleven
   super-genres in his screenwriters' taxonomy, claiming that all
   feature-length narrative films can be classified as belonging to one of
   them.^[b]^[16]

   The British military historian Antony Beevor "despair[s]" at how
   film-makers from America and Britain "play fast and loose with the facts",
   yet imply that "their version is as good as the truth".^[17] For example,
   he calls the 2000 American film U-571 a "shameless deception" for
   pretending that a US warship had helped to win the Battle of the
   Atlantic—seven months before America entered the war.^[17] He is equally
   critical of Christopher Nolan's 2017 film Dunkirk with its unhistorically
   empty beaches, low-level air combat over the sea, and rescues mainly by
   the "little ships".^[17] Beevor feels, however, that Continental European
   film-makers are often "far more scrupulous"; for example, in his view the
   2004 German film Downfall accurately depicted the historical events of
   Hitler's final days in his Berlin bunker,^[17] and he considers the 1965
   French film The 317th Platoon, set in Vietnam, "the greatest war movie
   ever made". The 1966 film The Battle of Algiers is, he argues, a close
   second.^[17]

History[edit]

  American Civil War[edit]

   The costliest war in U.S. history in terms of American life, this war has
   been the subject of, or the backdrop to, numerous films, documentaries and
   mini-series. One of the earliest films using the Civil War as its subject
   was D.W. Griffith's 1910 silent picture, The Fugitive.^[18] Films that
   have the war as its main subject, or about a certain aspect of the war,
   include the 1989 film Glory, about the first formal unit of the Union Army
   during the American Civil War to be made up entirely of Black
   volunteers.^[19] Some films such as Gettysburg focused on a single battle
   during the war,^[20] or even on a single incident, like the French short
   film La Rivière du Hibou (An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge)^[21] and
   Disney's The Great Locomotive Chase (1956).^[22] Others like the 1993
   miniseries North and South spanned the entire breadth of the war. Some
   films deal with the human aspects of the war, such as The Red Badge of
   Courage (1951),^[23] or Shenandoah (1965), on the tragedy that the war
   inflicted on the civilian population.^[24] Ken Burns's The Civil War is
   the most-watched documentary in the history of PBS.^[25]

   [IMG]1918 film poster for Die grosse Schlacht in Frankreich (The Great
   Battle in France), with Hindenburg in the background

  The Spanish–American War[edit]

   The first war films come from the Spanish–American War of 1898. Short
   "actualities"—documentary film-clips—included Burial of the Maine Victims,
   Blanket-Tossing of a New Recruit, and Soldiers Washing Dishes. These
   non-combat films were accompanied by "reenactments" of fighting, such as
   of Theodore Roosevelt's "Rough Riders" in action against the Spanish,
   staged in the United States.^[26]

  First World War[edit]

   Further information: Fiction based on World War I, History of the United
   Kingdom during the First World War § Media, United States home front
   during World War I § Motion pictures, and Home front during World War I

   During the First World War, many films were made about life in the war.
   Topics included prisoners of war, covert operations, and military
   training. Both the Central Powers and the Allies produced war
   documentaries. The films were also used as propaganda in neutral countries
   like the United States. Among these was a film shot on the Eastern Front
   by official war photographer to the Central Powers, Albert K. Dawson: The
   Battle and Fall of Przemysl (1915), depicting the Siege of Przemyśl,
   disastrous for the Austrians, with incidents reenacted using soldiers as
   extras.^[27]^[28]

   The 1915 Australian film Within Our Gates (also known as Deeds that Won
   Gallipoli) by Frank Harvey was described by the Motion Picture News as "a
   really good war story, which is exceptional".^[29]

   [IMG]Staged scene of British troops advancing through barbed wire from The
   Battle of the Somme, 1916

   The 1916 British film The Battle of the Somme, by two official
   cinematographers, Geoffrey Malins and John McDowell, combined documentary
   and propaganda, seeking to give the public an impression of what trench
   warfare was like. Much of the film was shot on location at the Western
   Front in France; it had a powerful emotional impact. It was watched by
   some 20 million people in Britain in its six weeks of exhibition, making
   it what the critic Francine Stock called "one of the most successful films
   of all time".^[30]^[31]

   The 1925 American film The Big Parade depicted unglamorous elements of
   war: the protagonist loses his leg, and his friends are killed.^[32]
   William A. Wellman's Wings (1927) showed aerial combat during the war and
   was made in cooperation with the Army Air Corps. It proved a powerful
   recruiting tool.^[33] It became the first film (in any genre) to be
   awarded an Oscar for best picture.^[34] Later films of varied genres that
   deal with the First World War include David Lean's "colossal epic", both
   war film and biopic^[35] Lawrence of Arabia (1962), shot in the then
   unfamiliar and exciting 70mm Technicolor,^[36] and described by Steven
   Spielberg as "maybe the greatest screenplay ever written for the
   motion-picture medium";^[35] Richard Attenborough's satirical anti-war
   musical comedy based on Joan Littlewood's play of the same name, Oh! What
   a Lovely War (1969);^[37] Spielberg's 2011 war drama War Horse was based
   on Michael Morpurgo's children's novel of the same name.^[38]

   Many of the films promoted as "documentaries" added context to authentic
   battlefield scenes by staging critical events, and invented episodes and
   dialog to enhance excitement at the cost of authenticity.^[39]

  Finnish Civil War[edit]

   Although the 1918 Finnish Civil War between Whites and Reds remained a
   controversial topic a century later in Finland,^[40]^[41] many Finnish
   filmmakers have taken up the subject, often basing their work on a book.
   In 1957, Toivo Särkkä's 1918, based on Jarl Hemmer's play and novel, was
   screened at the 7th Berlin International Film Festival.^[42] Recent films
   include Lauri Törhönen's 2007 The Border,^[43]^[44] and Aku Louhimies's
   2008 Tears of April, based on Leena Lander's novel.^[45] Perhaps the most
   famous film about the Finnish Civil War is Edvin Laine's 1968 Here,
   Beneath the North Star, based on the first two books of Väinö Linna's
   Under the North Star trilogy; it describing the civil war from the losing
   side, Finland's Red Guards.^[46]

  Spanish Civil War[edit]

   Further information: List of Spanish Civil War films
   [IMG]Soviet poster for an exhibition about the Spanish Civil War, 1936

   The Spanish Civil War has attracted directors from different countries.
   Sam Wood's For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), based on Ernest Hemingway's
   book of the same name, portrays the fated romance between an American
   played by Gary Cooper and a partisan played by Ingrid Bergman against the
   backdrop of the civil war. The epic 168-minute film with its landscapes
   shot in Technicolor and a "beautiful" orchestral score was a success both
   with audiences and with critics.^[47] Alain Resnais's Guernica (1950) uses
   Picasso's 1937 painting of the same name to protest against war.^[47]
   Carlos Saura's La Caza (The Hunt, 1966) uses the metaphor of hunting to
   criticise the aggressiveness of Spanish fascism.^[48] It won the Silver
   Bear for Best Director at the 16th Berlin International Film Festival in
   1966.^[49] Ken Loach's Land and Freedom (Tierra y Libertad, 1995), loosely
   based on George Orwell's Homage to Catalonia, follows a British communist
   through the war to reveal the painful contradictions within the
   anti-fascist Republican side.^[47]

  Korean War[edit]

   See also: Category:Korean War films

   Samuel Fuller's The Steel Helmet (1951) was made during the Korean War
   (1950–1953). The critic Guy Westwell notes that it questioned the conduct
   of the war, as did later films like The Bridges at Toko-Ri (1954) and Pork
   Chop Hill (1959).^[50] Fuller agreed that all his films were anti-war. No
   Hollywood films about the Korean War did well at the box office; the
   historian Lary May suggested in 2001 that they reminded American viewers
   of "the only war we have lost".^[51]

   In 1955, after the fighting, the successful South Korean action film
   Piagol about leftist guerrilla atrocities encouraged other film-makers.
   The 1960s military government punished pro-communist film-makers and gave
   Grand Bell Awards to films with the strongest anti-communist message. The
   Taebaek Mountains (1994) dealt with leftists from the south who fought for
   the communists, while Silver Stallion (1991) and Spring in My Hometown
   (1998) showed the destructive impact of American military presence on
   village life. The violent action films Shiri (1999) and Joint Security
   Area (2000) presented North Korea in a favourable light.^[52]

   Films in North Korea were made by government film studios and had clear
   political messages. The first was My Home Village (1949), on the
   liberation of Korea from the Japanese, presented as the work of Kim Il
   Sung without help from the Americans. Similarly, the country's films about
   the Korean War show victory without help from the Chinese. The film
   scholar Johannes Schönherr concludes that the purpose of these films is
   "to portray North Korea as a country under siege", and that since the U.S.
   and its "puppet" South Korea invaded the North once, they would do so
   again.^[53]

  Algerian War[edit]

   Gillo Pontecorvo's dramatic The Battle of Algiers ((Italian: La battaglia
   di Algeri; Arabic: معركة الجزائر; French: La Bataille d'Alger), 1966)
   portrayed events in the Algerian War (1954–1956). It was shot on location
   as an Italo-Algerian co-production. It had the black and white newsreel
   style of Italian neorealism, and even-handedly depicts violence on both
   sides. It won various awards including Golden Lion at the Venice Film
   Festival.^[54] It was attacked by French critics and was for five years
   banned in France as well as Jamila, the Algerian (1958).^[55]

  Vietnam War[edit]

   Further information: Vietnam War in film

   Few films before the late 1970s about the Vietnam War actually depicted
   combat;^[56] exceptions include The Green Berets (1968).^[56] Critics such
   as Basinger explain that Hollywood avoided the subject because of
   opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, making the
   subject divisive; in addition, the film industry was in crisis, and the
   army did not wish to assist in making anti-war films.^[56]^[57]

   From the late 1970s, independently financed and produced films showed
   Hollywood that Vietnam could be treated in film. Successful but very
   different portrayals of the war in which America had been defeated
   included Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter (1978), and Francis Ford
   Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979).^[56] With the shift in American politics
   to the right in the 1980s, military success could again be shown in films
   such as Oliver Stone's Platoon (1986), Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket
   (1987) and John Irvin's Hamburger Hill (1987).^[56]

   The Vietnamese director Nguyễn Hồng Sến [vi]'s The Abandoned Field: Free
   Fire Zone (Cánh đồng hoang, 1979) gives an "unnerving and compelling ..
   subjective-camera-eye-view" of life under helicopter fire in the Mekong
   Delta during the Vietnam War. The film cuts to an (American)
   "helicopter-eye view", contrasting painfully with the human tenderness
   seen earlier.^[58]

  Later wars[edit]

   Dino Mustafić's Remake (2003), written by Zlatko Topčić, tells the
   parallel coming-of-age stories of a father living in Sarajevo during World
   War II and his son living through the Siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian
   War. According to Topčić, the story is based on incidents from his own
   life.^[59]^[60]

   The Iraq War served as the background story of U.S. movies, like The Hurt
   Locker from 2008, Green Zone from 2010,^[61] and American Sniper from
   2014.

   The War in Afghanistan since 2001 was depicted in various movies, among
   them Restrepo in 2010 and Lone Survivor from 2013.^[61]

Second World War[edit]

  Made by Western Allies[edit]

   Further information: List of Allied propaganda films of World War II

   The first popular Allied war films made during the Second World War came
   from Britain and combined the functions of documentary and propaganda.
   Films such as The Lion Has Wings and Target for Tonight were made under
   the control of the Films Division of the Ministry of Information. The
   British film industry began to combine documentary techniques with
   fictional stories in films like Noël Coward and David Lean's In Which We
   Serve (1942)—"the most successful British film of the war
   years"^[62]—Millions Like Us (1943), and The Way Ahead (1944).^[63]

   [IMG]B-25s about to launch from the USS Hornet in Thirty Seconds Over
   Tokyo (1944)

   In America, documentaries were produced in various ways: General Marshall
   commissioned the Why We Fight propaganda series from Frank Capra; the War
   Department's Information-Education Division started out making training
   films for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy; the Army made its own through
   the U.S. Signal Corps, including John Huston's The Battle of San
   Pietro.^[64] Hollywood made films with propaganda messages about America's
   allies, such as Mrs. Miniver (1942), which portrayed a British family on
   the home front;^[65] Edge of Darkness (1943) showed Norwegian resistance
   fighters,^[66] and The North Star (1943) showed the Soviet Union and its
   Communist Party.^[67] Towards the end of the war popular books provided
   higher quality and more serious stories for films such as Guadalcanal
   Diary (1943),^[68] Mervyn LeRoy's Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944),^[69]
   and John Ford's They Were Expendable (1945).^[70]

   ski infantry ride into battle on BT-7 cavalry tanks in the Battle of
   Moscow

   The Soviet Union, too, appreciated the propaganda value of film, to
   publicise both victories and German atrocities. Ilya Kopalin's documentary
   Moscow Strikes Back (Russian: Разгром немецких войск под Москвой,
   literally "The rout of the German troops near Moscow"), was made during
   the Battle of Moscow between October 1941 and January 1942. It depicted
   civilians helping to defend the city, the parade in Red Square and
   Stalin's speech rousing the Russian people to battle, actual fighting,
   Germans surrendering and dead, and atrocities including murdered children
   and hanged civilians. It won an Academy Award in 1943 for best
   documentary.^[71]^[72] Newsreel cameras were similarly rushed to
   Stalingrad early in 1943 to record "the spectacle which greeted the
   Russian soldiers"—the starvation of Russian prisoners of war in the
   Voropovono camp by the German Sixth Army, defeated in the Battle of
   Stalingrad.^[73]

   Feature films made in the west during the war were subject to censorship
   and were not always realistic in nature. One of the first to attempt to
   represent violence, and which was praised at the time for "gritty
   realism", was Tay Garnett's Bataan (1943). The depiction actually remained
   stylised. Jeanine Basinger gives as an example the "worst image for stark
   violence" when a Japanese soldier beheads an American: the victim shows
   pain and his lips freeze in a scream, yet no blood spurts and his head
   does not fall off. Basinger points out that while this is physically
   unrealistic, psychologically it may not have been. The wartime audience
   was, she points out, well aware of friends and relatives who had been
   killed or who had come home wounded.^[74]

  Made by Axis powers[edit]

   War II
   [IMG]Hitler and Goebbels visiting Universum Film AG in 1935. The studio
   made propaganda films such as Triumph des Willens (1935) and Kolberg
   (1945).

   The Axis powers similarly made films during the Second World War, for
   propaganda and other purposes. In Germany, the army high command brought
   out Sieg im Westen ("Victory in the West", 1941).^[75] Other Nazi
   propaganda films had varied subjects, as with Kolberg (1945), which
   depicts stubborn Prussian resistance in the Siege of Kolberg (1807) to the
   invading French troops under Napoleon.^[76] The propaganda minister Joseph
   Goebbels chose the historical subject as suitable for the worsening
   situation facing Nazi Germany when it was filmed from October 1943 to
   August 1944. At over eight million marks, using thousands of soldiers as
   extras and 100 railway wagonloads of salt to simulate snow, it was the
   most costly German film made during the war. The actual siege ended with
   the surrender of the town; in the film, the French generals abandon the
   siege.^[77]

   For Japan, the war began with the undeclared war and invasion of China in
   1937, which the Japanese authorities called "The China Incident". The
   government dispatched a "pen brigade" to write and film the action in
   China with "humanist values". Tomotaka Tasaka's Mud and Soldiers (1939)
   for instance, shot on location in China, Kōzaburō Yoshimura's Legend of
   Tank Commander Nishizumi, and Sato Takeshi's Chocolate and Soldiers (1938)
   show the common Japanese soldier as an individual and as a family man, and
   even enemy Chinese soldiers are presented as individuals, sometimes
   fighting bravely.^[78] Once war with the United States was declared, the
   Japanese conflict became known as the Pacific War. Japanese film critics
   worried that even with Western film techniques, their film output failed
   to represent native Japanese values.^[79] The historian John Dower found
   that Japanese wartime films had been largely forgotten, as "losers do not
   get reruns", yet they were so subtle and skilful that Frank Capra thought
   Chocolate and Soldiers unbeatable. Heroes were typically low-ranking
   officers, not samurai, calmly devoted to his men and his country.^[80]
   These films did not personalise the enemy and therefore lacked hatred,
   though Great Britain could figure as the "cultural enemy". For Japanese
   film-makers, war was not a cause but more like a natural disaster, and
   "what mattered was not whom one fought but how well". Asian enemies,
   especially the Chinese, were often portrayed as redeemable and even
   possible marriage partners. Japanese wartime films do not glorify war, but
   present the Japanese state as one great family and the Japanese people as
   an "innocent, suffering, self-sacrificing people". Dower comments that the
   perversity of this image "is obvious: it is devoid of any recognition
   that, at every level, the Japanese also victimized others."^[81]

  Postwar[edit]

   According to Andrew Pulver of The Guardian, the public fascination with
   war films became an "obsession", with over 200 war films produced in each
   decade of the 1950s and 1960s.^[82] War film production in the United
   Kingdom and United States reached its zenith in the mid-1950s. ^[83] Its
   popularity in the United Kingdom was brought on by the critical and
   commercial success of Charles Frend's The Cruel Sea (1953).^[83] Like
   others of the period, The Cruel Sea was based on a bestselling novel, in
   this case the former naval commander Nicholas Monsarrat's story of the
   battle of the Atlantic.^[84]^[85] Others, like The Dam Busters (1954),
   with its exciting tale of the inventor Barnes Wallis's unorthodox bouncing
   bomb and its distinctive theme music, were true stories. The Dam Busters
   became the most popular film in Britain in 1955,^[86] and remained a
   favourite as of 2015 with a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes,^[87] though,
   partly because it celebrated an "exclusively British [victory]", it failed
   in the American market.^[88] A large number of war films were made in the
   1955–1958 period in particular. In 1957 alone, Bitter Victory, Count Five
   and Die, The Enemy Below, Ill Met by Moonlight, Men in War, The One That
   Got Away, and Seven Thunders, and the highly successful, critically
   acclaimed pictures The Bridge on the River Kwai (which won the Academy
   Award for Best Picture that year^[89]) and Paths of Glory were
   released.^[90] Some, such as Bitter Victory, focused more on the
   psychological battle between officers and egotism rather than events
   during the war.^[91] The Bridge on the River Kwai brought a new complexity
   to the war picture, with a sense of moral uncertainty surrounding war. By
   the end of the decade the "sense of shared achievement" which had been
   common in war films "began to evaporate", according to Pulver.^[82]

   Hollywood films in the 1950s and 1960s could display spectacular heroics
   or self-sacrifice, as in the popular Sands of Iwo Jima (1949) starring
   John Wayne. U.S. Marines considered Sands of Iwo Jima visually authentic,
   but found Lewis Milestone's Battle Cry (1955), with its attention to the
   lives of the men, the more realistic film.^[92] The formula for a
   successful war film consisted, according to Lawrence Suid, of a small
   group of ethnically diverse men; an unreasonable senior officer; cowards
   became heroic, or died.^[92] Jeanine Basinger suggests that a traditional
   war film should have a hero, a group, and an objective, and that the group
   should contain "an Italian, a Jew, a cynical complainer from Brooklyn, a
   sharpshooter from the mountains, a midwesterner (nicknamed by his state,
   'Iowa' or 'Dakota'), and a character who must be initiated in some
   way".^[74] Films based on real commando missions, like The Gift Horse
   (1952) based on the St. Nazaire Raid, and Ill Met by Moonlight (1956)
   based on the capture of the German commander of Crete, inspired fictional
   adventure films such as The Guns of Navarone (1961), The Train (1964), and
   Where Eagles Dare (1968). These used the war as a backdrop for spectacular
   action.^[82]

   Darryl F. Zanuck produced the 178 minute documentary drama The Longest Day
   (1962), based on the first day of the D-Day landings, achieving commercial
   success and Oscars.^[94] It was followed by large-scale but thoughtful
   films like Andrei Tarkovsky's Ivan's Childhood (1962), and
   quasi-documentary all-star epics filmed in Europe such as Battle of the
   Bulge (1965), Battle of Britain (1969), The Battle of Neretva (1969),
   Midway (1976), and A Bridge Too Far (1977). In Lawrence Suid's view, The
   Longest Day "served as the model for all subsequent combat
   spectaculars".^[95] However, its cost also made it the last of the
   traditional war films, while the controversy around the help given by the
   U.S. Army and Zanuck's "disregard for Pentagon relations" changed the way
   that Hollywood and the Army collaborated.^[95]

   Zanuck, by then an executive at 20th Century Fox, set up an
   American–Japanese co-production for Richard Fleischer's Tora! Tora! Tora!
   (1970) to depict what "really happened on December 7, 1941" in the
   surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.^[96]^[97] The film, panned by Roger
   Ebert^[98] and The New York Times,^[99] was a major success in Japan.^[96]
   Its realistic-looking attack footage was reused in later films such as
   Midway (1976), The Final Countdown (1980), and Australia (2008).^[100] The
   story was revisited in Pearl Harbor (2001), described by The New York
   Times as a "noisy, expensive and very long new blockbuster", with the
   comment that "for all its epic pretensions (as if epic were a matter of
   running time, tumescent music and earnest voice-over pronouncements), the
   movie works best as a bang-and-boom action picture".^[101]

   Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (1998) uses hand-held camera, sound
   design, staging, and increased audio-visual detail to defamiliarise
   viewers accustomed to conventional combat films, so as to create what film
   historian Stuart Bender calls "reported realism", whether or not the
   portrayal is genuinely more realistic.^[102] Jeanine Basinger notes that
   critics experienced it as "groundbreaking and anti-generic", with, in
   James Wolcott's words, a "desire to bury the cornball, recruiting poster
   legend of John Wayne: to get it right this time"; and that combat films
   have always been "grounded in the need to help an audience understand and
   accept war".^[74] Its success revived interest in World War II
   films.^[103] Others tried to portray the reality of the war, as in Joseph
   Vilsmaier's Stalingrad (1993), which The New York Times said "goes about
   as far as a movie can go in depicting modern warfare as a stomach-turning
   form of mass slaughter".^[104]

   Many war films have been produced with the cooperation of a nation's
   military forces. Since the Second World War, the United States Navy has
   provided ships and technical guidance for films such as Top Gun. The U.S.
   Air Force assisted with The Big Lift, Strategic Air Command and A
   Gathering of Eagles, which were filmed on Air Force bases; Air Force
   personnel appeared in many roles.^[105] Critics have argued that the film
   Pearl Harbor's US-biased portrayal of events is a compensation for
   technical assistance received from the US armed forces, noting that the
   premiere was held on board a U.S. Navy carrier.^[106] In another case, the
   U.S. Navy objected to elements of Crimson Tide, especially mutiny on board
   an American naval vessel, so the film was produced without their
   assistance.^[107] The film historian Jonathan Rayner observes that such
   films "have also clearly been intended to serve vital propagandist,
   recruitment and public relations functions".^[106]

National traditions[edit]

  Chinese[edit]

   The first Chinese war films were newsreels like Battle of Wuhan (1911) and
   Battle of Shanghai (1913). Still in films such as Xu Xinfu's Battle
   Exploits (1925), war featured mainly as background. Only with the Second
   Sino–Japanese War from 1937 onwards did war film become a serious genre in
   China, with nationalistic films such as Shi Dongshan's Protect Our Land
   (1938). The Chinese Civil War, too, attracted films such as Cheng Yin's
   From Victory to Victory (1952). A more humanistic film set in the same
   period is Xie Jin's The Cradle (1979), while more recent large-scale
   commercial films include Lu Chuan's City of Life and Death (2009).^[108]
   Chinese directors have repeatedly attempted to cover the atrocities
   committed by the Japanese during the Nanjing Massacre (1937–1938), with
   films such as the political melodrama Massacre in Nanjing, Mou Tun Fei's
   docudrama Black Sun: The Nanking Massacre, and the "contrived
   Sino–Japanese romance" Don't Cry, Nanking.^[109] Zhang Yimou's epic
   Chinese film Flowers of War (2011), based on Geling Yan's novel, portrays
   the violent events through the eyes of a 13-year-old girl.^[110]

  Indonesian[edit]

   [IMG]The Siliwangi Division in combat, in a scene from Usmar Ismail's
   Darah dan Doa, 1950

   Many Indonesian films deal with the occupation of the archipelago by the
   Japanese during the Second World War. Teguh Karya's Doea Tanda Mata
   (Mementos, literally "Two Eye Marks", 1985) covers the limited nationalist
   resistance to Dutch colonial rule in the 1930s.^[111]^[112] A third group
   of films such as Enam Djam di Jogja (Six Hours in Yogyakarta, 1951) and
   Serangan Fajar (Attack at Dawn, 1983) covers the Indonesian war of
   independence (1945–1949). Two other films about the same period portray
   the Indonesian equivalent of the Chinese Long March: Usmar Ismail's Darah
   dan Doa (The Long March, literally "Blood and Prayer", 1950) and Mereka
   Kembali (They Return, 1975). Each of these films interprets the past from
   the perspective of its own time.^[112]

   The more recent Merdeka (Freedom) trilogy (2009–2011), starting with Merah
   Putih ("Red and White", the colours of the flag of the new Indonesia),
   revisits the campaign for independence through the lives of a diverse
   group of cadets who become guerillas.^[113]

   Karya's November 1828 (1979) looks at Indonesia's struggle for
   independence through historical drama about the Java or Diponegoro War
   (1825–1830), though the colonial enemy was the same, the Dutch. Deanne
   Schultz considered it "a valuable interpretation" of Indonesian history
   that "embodies the best of popular Indonesian cinema". It was the first
   Indonesian film to become well known internationally.^[114]

  Soviet[edit]

   [IMG]Russia's "cinema front": Yury Ozerov (left) directing the filming of
   Stalingrad, 1987

   War has been the Soviet Union's cinema's major genre, becoming known
   indeed as the "cinema front", and its war films ranged from grim
   portrayals of atrocities to sentimental and even quietly subversive
   accounts.^[115] Leonid Lukov's popular and "beautiful"^[116] Two Warriors
   (1943) depicted two stereotypical Soviet soldiers, a quiet Russian and an
   extrovert southerner from Odessa, singing in his dugout.^[117]

   The many Soviet films about the Second World War include both large-scale
   epics such as Yury Ozerov's Battle of Moscow (1985) and Mikhail
   Kalatozov's more psychological The Cranes are Flying (1957) on the cruel
   effects of war; it won the 1958 Palme d'Or at Cannes.^[118]

  Japanese[edit]

   See also: § Animated, and Category:Japanese war films

   Japanese directors have made popular films such as Submarine I-57 Will Not
   Surrender (1959), Battle of Okinawa (1971) and Japan's Longest Day (1967)
   from a Japanese perspective.^[119] These "generally fail to explain the
   cause of the war".^[120] In the decades immediately after the Second World
   War, Japanese films often focused on human tragedy rather than combat,
   such as The Burmese Harp (1956) and Fires on the Plain (1959).^[120] From
   the late 1990s, films started to take a positive view of the war and of
   Japanese actions. These nationalistic films, including Pride (1998),
   Merdeka 17805 (2001), and The Truth about Nanjing (2007), have emphasized
   positive traits of the Japanese military and contended that the Japanese
   were victims of post-war vindictiveness and viciousness. Such films have,
   however, been subject to protest for revisionism.^[120]^[121]^[122] The
   Eternal Zero (2013) narrates the tale of a Zero fighter pilot who is
   considered a coward by his comrades, as he returns alive from his
   missions. It broke the record takings for a Japanese live action
   film,^[123] and won the Golden Mulberry at the Udine Far East Film
   Festival,^[124] but was criticised for its nationalistic sympathy with
   kamikaze pilots.^[125]

Subgenres[edit]

  Documentary[edit]

   Further information: Documentary war film and List of World War II
   documentary films

   The wartime authorities in both Britain and America produced a wide
   variety of documentary films. Their purposes included military training,
   advice to civilians, and encouragement to maintain security. Since these
   films often carried messages, they grade into propaganda. Similarly,
   commercially produced films often combined information, support for the
   war effort, and a degree of propaganda.^[63]^[64] Newsreels, ostensibly
   simply for information, were made in both Allied and Axis countries, and
   were often dramatised.^[126]^[127]^[128] More recently, in the Iran–Iraq
   War, Morteza Avini's Ravayat-e Fath (Chronicles of Victory) television
   series combined front-line footage with commentary.^[129]

  Propaganda[edit]

   Sergei Eisenstein's 1938 historical drama Alexander Nevsky depicts Prince
   Alexander's defeat of the attempted invasion of the Russian city of
   Novgorod by the Teutonic Knights.^[130] By April 1939 the film had been
   seen by 23,000,000 people.^[131] In 1941 the director and three others
   were awarded the Stalin Prize for their contributions. The film features a
   musical score by the classical composer Sergei Prokofiev, considered by
   artists such as the composer André Previn the best ever written for
   cinema.^[132]^[133] Russell Merritt, writing in Film Quarterly, describes
   it as a "war propaganda film".^[134] A 1978 Mondadori poll placed
   Alexander Nevsky among the world's 100 best motion pictures.^[135]

   [IMG]Screenshot from Frank Capra's wartime Why We Fight series,^[136]
   depicting lies being broadcast by the Nazi propaganda machine

   During the Second World War, film propaganda was widely used. Kenneth
   Clark advised the British government that "If we renounced interest in
   entertainment as such, we might be deprived of a valuable weapon for
   getting across our propaganda"; he suggested using documentaries about the
   war and the war effort; celebrations of Britishness; and films about
   British life and character. Michael Powell and Clark agreed on a story
   about survivors of a U-boat crew, imbued with brutal Nazi ideology,
   travelling across Canada and meeting various kind, tolerant and
   intelligent Canadians, to encourage America into the war. The resulting
   film, 49th Parallel (1941), became the top film at British offices that
   year.^[137] Entertaining films could carry messages about the need for
   vigilance, too, as in Went the Day Well? (1942) or the avoidance of
   "careless talk", as in The Next of Kin (1942).^[63]

   [IMG]The romantic drama Casablanca (1943) vilified Nazism.

   In America, Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator (1940) clearly satirised
   fascism.^[138] Michael Curtiz's Casablanca (1943) was not simply a romance
   between the characters played by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, but
   vilified the Nazis and glorified resistance to them.^[138] Frank Capra's
   Why We Fight series (1942–1945) won the 1942 Academy Award for best
   documentary, though it was designed to "influence opinion in the U.S.
   military".^[64]^[139]

   During the Cold War, "propaganda played as much of a role in the United
   States' struggle with the Soviet Union as did the billions of dollars
   spent on weaponry."^[140] Face to Face with Communism (1951) dramatised an
   imagined invasion of the United States; other films portrayed threats such
   as communist indoctrination.^[140]

  Submarine[edit]

   Main article: Submarine films
   [IMG]The cramped, equipment-filled setting of a submarine film, Das Boot
   (1981), recreated in the Bavaria film studio

   Submarine films have their own particular meanings and conventions,
   concerned specifically with giving the effect of submarine warfare. A
   distinctive element in this subgenre is the soundtrack, which attempts to
   bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea.
   For example, in Wolfgang Petersen's 1981 Das Boot, the sound design works
   together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with
   depth charges, the ping of sonar, and threatening sounds such as of the
   propellers of enemy destroyers and torpedoes.^[141] Classic films in the
   genre include The Enemy Below (1957)^[142] and Run Silent, Run Deep
   (1958), both based on novels by naval commanders. Run Silent, Run Deep is
   a movie full of tension, both with the enemy and between the contrasting
   personalities of the submarine Commander and his Lieutenant, played by
   Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster.^[143]

  Prisoner of war[edit]

   Further information: Prisoner of war § In popular culture
   [IMG]Model of Stalag Luft III used in filming The Great Escape (1963)

   A popular subgenre of war films in the 1950s and 1960s was the prisoner of
   war film.^[144] The genre was popularised in Britain with major films like
   Guy Hamilton's The Colditz Story (1955) and John Sturges's American film
   The Great Escape (1963).^[144] They told stories of real escapes from
   German prisoner of war camps such as Stalag Luft III in the Second World
   War. Despite episodes of danger and human tragedy, these films delight in
   a continual boyish game of escape and ingenuity, celebrating the courage
   and the defiant spirit of the prisoners of war, and treating war as
   fun.^[144]^[145]^[146] David Lean's Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) was
   judged best picture at the Oscars; it took the genre from chilly German
   prisons to the heat of a camp in Thailand. It was the first, too, to use
   lush colour to bring out the British stiff upper lip of the colonel,
   played by Alec Guinness in an Oscar-winning performance.^[144] The
   "definitive" Oscar-winning prisoner of war film was Billy Wilder's Stalag
   17 (1953), while the brief but powerful prison camp scenes of The Deer
   Hunter (1978) lend an air of tragedy to the whole of that film.^[144]

  Comedy[edit]

   [IMG]First military comedy: Charlie Chaplin's Shoulder Arms (1918)
   Further information: Comedy film § Military comedy

   Charlie Chaplin's Shoulder Arms (1918) set a style for war films to come,
   and was the first comedy about war in film history.^[147]^[148]

   British cinema in the Second World War marked the evacuation of children
   from London with social comedies such as Those Kids from Town (1942) where
   the evacuees go to stay with an earl, while in Cottage to Let (1941) and
   Went the Day Well? (1942) the English countryside is thick with
   spies.^[149] Gasbags (1941) offered "zany, irreverent, knockabout" comedy
   making fun of everything from barrage balloons to concentration
   camps.^[150] Abbott and Costello's Buck Privates (1941) was successful in
   America,^[151] leading to many further wartime comedies.^[152]

  Animated[edit]

   [IMG]First animated propaganda film: Winsor McCay's The Sinking of the
   Lusitania (1918)

   Winsor McCay's The Sinking of the Lusitania (1918) was a silent First
   World War film. At 12 minutes long, it was the longest animated film made
   at that time. It was probably the first animated propaganda film to be
   made; it remains the earliest serious animated drama that has
   survived.^[153]^[154]^[155] Through World War II, animated propaganda
   shorts remained influential in American cinema. The Walt Disney Company,
   working with the American armed forces, produced 400,000 feet of war
   propaganda films between 1942 and 1945,^[156] including Der Fuehrer's Face
   (1943) and Education for Death (1943).^[157]

   Japanese anime films from the 1960s onwards addressed national memories of
   war. Akira (1988) moves from the atomic destruction of Hiroshima and
   Nagasaki to apocalyptic visions of global conflict; Grave of the Fireflies
   (1988) is elegiac on the effect of war on children.^[158]^[159] Barefoot
   Gen (1983) portrays the bombing of Hiroshima through the eyes of a
   child,^[160] but reviewers consider it a less well made film than Grave of
   the Fireflies with "stomach-churning detail" bizarrely paired with crude
   artwork, giving it the look of a "Saturday morning Warner Brothers
   cartoon".^[161]

  Anti-war[edit]

   Further information: List of anti-war films
   [IMG]Anti-war: Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front, 1930

   The anti-war genre began with films about the First World War. Films in
   the genre are typically revisionist, reflecting on past events and often
   generically blended. Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front
   (1930) was unquestionably powerful, and an early anti-war film, portraying
   a German point of view; it was the first film (in any genre) to win two
   Oscars, best picture and best director.^[148] Andrew Kelly, analysing All
   Quiet on the Western Front, defined the genre as showing: the brutality of
   war; the amount of human suffering; the betrayal of men's trust by
   incompetent officers. War and anti-war films often prove difficult to
   categorize as they contain many generic ambiguities.^[1] While many
   anti-war films criticize war directly through depictions of grisly combat
   in past wars, some films such as Penn's Alice's Restaurant criticized war
   obliquely by poking fun at such things as the draft board.^[162] The
   number of anti-war films produced in America dipped sharply during the
   1950s because of McCarthyism and the Hollywood blacklist.^[163] The end of
   the blacklist and the introduction of the MPAA rating system marked a time
   of resurgence for films of all type including anti-war films in the
   States. Robert Eberwein names two films as anti-war classics.^[164] The
   first is Jean Renoir's prisoner of war masterpiece^[148] La Grande
   Illusion (The Grand Illusion, 1937). Renoir's critique of contemporary
   politics and ideology celebrates the universal humanity that transcends
   national and racial boundaries and radical nationalism, suggesting that
   mankind's common experiences should prevail above political division, and
   its extension: war.^[165] The second is Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory
   (1957). The critic David Ehrenstein writes that Paths of Glory established
   Kubrick as the "leading commercial filmmaker of his generation" and a
   world-class talent. Ehrenstein describes the film as an "outwardly
   cool/inwardly passionate protest drama about a disastrous French army
   maneuver and the court-martial held in its wake", contrasting it with the
   "classic" All Quiet on the Western Front's story of an innocent "unstrung
   by the horrors of war".^[166]

  Mixed genres[edit]

   Comedy gave scope for satire, and post-war film-makers merged comedy and
   anti-war sentiment in films as varied as Stalag 17 (1953) and Dr
   Strangelove (1964).^[167] Black comedies like Mike Nichols's Catch-22
   (1970), based on Joseph Heller's satirical novel about the Second World
   War, and Robert Altman's MASH (1970), set in Korea, reflected the
   attitudes of an increasingly sceptical public during the Vietnam
   War.^[168]

   Other genres were combined in Franklin J. Schaffner's Patton (1970), about
   real life General George S. Patton, where combat scenes were interleaved
   with commentary about how he waged war, showing good and bad sides to a
   command. It and MASH became the two most profitable war/anti-war films
   made up to that time,^[169] and Patton won seven Academy Awards.^[170]

            War movies are big earners. What does that say about us?

   War film is serious business. It has been from the beginning, when William
   Wellman’s Wings (1927) became the first World War I romantic drama to win
   an Oscar for best picture. One hundred years later, the supply of war
   films seems inexhaustible and their box-office attraction unbroken.

   Adjusted for inflation, Lawrence of Arabia (1962) made US$589.2 million
   and Schindler’s List (1993) US$569.5 million. Michael Bay’s Pearl Harbor
   (2001) grossed US$648.5 million. American Sniper (2015) grossed US$590.5
   million.

   The war film genre and its fascination remains.

   There we sit, watching generations get wiped out. We see terrifying
   technological inventions like the atomic bomb being dropped on Hiroshima.
   Removed from actual war in time and place, these big-screen productions
   are horrible yet spellbinding at the same time.

   War Horse (2011) is a particularly effective exploration of this
   experience and what it gives to audiences. Steven Spielberg’s film tells
   the story of a young horse and his owner forced from the idyllic fields of
   rural England into the bloody trenches of first world war France.

   War Horse illustrates the fragile balance of peace, and how sacrifice
   forms lasting bonds across borders, languages and species, echoing the
   Great War’s hard-won reconciliation process as Europeans bonded over grief
   and common trauma. Spielberg pairs moral guidance and a sense of what
   really matters in life with breathtaking landscape shots and fast-paced
   action sequences.

   But this is only one story and only one way to present war as a noble
   sacrifice to forge unity. There is no standard formula to explain why the
   experience of war continuously attracts millions of viewers. The answer is
   different for each war story, and it is different in each nation.

The national war complex

   The first Australian film to win an Academy Award was Damien Parer’s
   documentary of the fighting in New Guinea in 1942. The film garnered a
   Best Documentary Oscar for bringing the immediate experience of humanity
   at war to Australia: the wounded; the anxiety; the young soldiers’ fear of
   death far from home.

   Parer himself was killed in action in 1944 in the Palau archipelago in
   Micronesia. His cinematic legacy is a sobering documentation of
   Australians at war without flagwavers or hyper-masculine action heroes.

   Damien Parer also shot photographs while in New Guinea, including this one
   at a rest spot on the Kokoda Trail. Australian War Memorial

   SBS recently ran a week of war films in the lead-up to ANZAC Day, leading
   with Churchill (2017), which portrays the inner world of Britain’s wartime
   prime minister.

   Downfall (2004) looks at Hitler’s final days barricaded in his Berlin
   Führerbunker. Testament of Youth (2015) is a heart-swollen romance of WWI
   nurse Vera Brittain’s literary memoirs and her calls for pacifism.

   SBS’s War Week included no actual documentary footage like that of
   Parer’s.

   Today, the idea of an authentic representation of war seems less appealing
   to audiences. Marvel Studios broke box-office records all over the world
   with its fantasy battle and sci-fi war film Avengers: Endgame (2019).
   Perhaps too much reality in depicting war, the starkest of all modern
   realities, is simply unbearable. And so the re-enchantment of war comes
   with laser battles and magic gauntlets.

Fact versus fiction

   How we explore war on film has sparked heated debates.

   One argument holds the true horror of war is increasingly obscured by
   technology, Hollywood star power, and clever marketing campaigns.

   The popular HBO documentary television miniseries Band of Brothers (2001)
   and The Pacific (2010) caused controversy among military historians who
   accused the series of endorsing war nostalgia, making the audience take
   sides, and actively shaping collective modern memory through re-enacted
   combat scenes.

   War has been co-opted as an entertainment favourite in countries all
   across the world, allowing audiences to think of it as a metaphor to
   explore issues like sexism or mortality.

   One of the most popular South Korean war films, Jang Hoon’s The Front Line
   (2011), suggests the meaning of life cannot be found in senseless wars.
   The Cave (2019), a war documentary by Syrian director Feras Fayyad, shows
   how a group of female doctors in Ghouta struggle with systemic sexism
   while tending to thousands of the injured.

   Peter Jackson’s They Shall Not Grow Old (2018) drew almost unanimous
   critical acclaim.

   Jackson’s film produces a modern war experience by enhancing documentary
   footage of the first world war. We see the real faces of war: they talk,
   they smoke makeshift cigarettes, they are shellshocked victims of their
   time.

   Jackson used computerised colouration and recordings of veteran interviews
   as voiceovers. He hired forensic lip readers to superimpose dialogue on
   the previously silent combatants’ voices.

   The result is a conflicting truth about war and how its memories grow
   truer and more real before our eyes and in our ears if we want them to,
   rather than feeling safe in the fact those bombastic Hollywood scenes on
   screen can never become our reality.

                             Children Under Attack

  Children are coming under attack in conflicts across the world. We can’t
  accept this as a ‘new normal.’

   Around the world, attacks on children continue unabated. The number of
   countries experiencing violent conflict is the highest it has been in the
   last 30 years. The result is that more than 30 million children have been
   displaced by conflict. Many of them are being enslaved, trafficked, abused
   and exploited. Many more are living in limbo, without official immigration
   status or access to education and health care. From Afghanistan to Mali,
   to South Sudan, Yemen and beyond, warring parties are flouting one of the
   most basic rules of war: the protection of children.

     Children have become frontline targets. This is a moral crisis of our
     age: We must never accept this as the ‘new normal.’

   To better monitor, prevent, and end attacks against children, the United
   Nations Security Council has identified and condemned six grave violations
   against children in times of war: Killing and maiming of children;
   recruitment or use of children in armed forces and armed groups; attacks
   on schools or hospitals; rape or other grave sexual violence; abduction of
   children; and denial of humanitarian access for children.  

   Between 2005 and 2022, more than 315,000 grave violations were verified
   against children, committed by parties to conflict in more than 30
   conflict situations across Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin
   America. The actual number is undoubtedly far higher.  

Stop attacks on children

   Ultimately children need peace to thrive. It is critical for children that
   efforts to end today’s seemingly endless armed conflicts are redoubled.
   But children cannot wait for protection – while wars continue, we must
   never accept attacks against children.

   More than 30 years since the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of
   the Child, and more than 70 years since the four Geneva Conventions – the
   international legal bedrock to protect civilians in war – it is time to
   say “Enough! Stop attacks on children.”

What we can all do to make change happen

   Citizens everywhere can begin by not averting their gaze from children’s
   suffering, because it seems too distant or the politics of conflict too
   complex.

   We must insist to national and international leaders that protecting
   children during armed conflict is the cornerstone of our shared humanity.

   We must demand leadership which is prepared to act to prevent attacks and
   violence against children trapped in war zones.

   Governments and all warring parties where conflicts rage must act to
   fulfil their obligations to protect children and enable access to
   specialized response services for children affected by violence.

   Communities in conflict-affected areas must be supported to create
   protective environments for girls and boys.

   Governments who support or who have influence over warring parties must
   use all their influence to insist children are protected according to the
   requirements of international law.

   International peace and security institutions such as the United Nations
   Security Council and regional organizations can do more to prioritize the
   safety and well-being of children trapped in armed conflicts.

   The international community can do more to support programmes which work
   to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation, and deliver
   the services needed to help children come through conflict with hope for a
   better future.

   By protecting children from attacks in armed conflict, we keep hope alive,
   we begin to prepare children to shape peaceful futures for themselves and
   their countries. Acting together, we can turn back this deadly ‘new
   normal’ of attacks against children and preserve humanity.

   Children cannot wait. We must act now.

Protecting children from explosive weapons in populated areas

   In conflicts around the world, civilians continue to endure the
   devastating consequences of the use of explosive weapons in populated
   areas (EWIPA). When used in cities, towns and villages, these weapons
   often have effects well beyond their targets. They claim countless lives
   and limbs, cause widespread destruction, and deprive people of essential
   civilian services, such as water and sanitation, electricity, health care
   and education.

   On 18 November 2022, a new political declaration was launched:
   “Strengthening the Protection of Civilians from the Humanitarian
   Consequences Arising from the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated
   Areas.” The declaration, which had been signed by 80 states by 19 November
   2022, sends a strong signal worldwide that harming civilians and damaging
   cities is not a reality we should accept by committing signatory States to
   restrict or refrain from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.

   Psychological warfare (PSYWAR), or the basic aspects of modern
   psychological operations (PsyOp), have been known by many other names or
   terms, including Military Information Support Operations (MISO), Psy Ops,
   political warfare, "Hearts and Minds", and propaganda.^[1] The term is
   used "to denote any action which is practiced mainly by psychological
   methods with the aim of evoking a planned psychological reaction in other
   people".^[2]

   Various techniques are used, and are aimed at influencing a target
   audience's value system, belief system, emotions, motives, reasoning, or
   behavior. It is used to induce confessions or reinforce attitudes and
   behaviors favorable to the originator's objectives, and are sometimes
   combined with black operations or false flag tactics. It is also used to
   destroy the morale of enemies through tactics that aim to depress troops'
   psychological states.^[3]^[4]

   Target audiences can be governments, organizations, groups, and
   individuals, and is not just limited to soldiers. Civilians of foreign
   territories can also be targeted by technology and media so as to cause an
   effect on the government of their country.^[5]

   Mass communication such as radio allows for direct communication with an
   enemy populace, and therefore has been used in many efforts. Social media
   channels and the internet allow for campaigns of disinformation and
   misinformation performed by agents anywhere in the world.^[6]

History[edit]

  Early[edit]

   [IMG]Mosaic of Alexander the Great on his campaign against the Persian
   Empire.

   Since prehistoric times, warlords and chiefs have recognized the
   importance of weakening the morale of their opponents. In the Battle of
   Pelusium (525 BC) between the Persian Empire and ancient Egypt, the
   Persian forces used cats and other animals as a psychological tactic
   against the Egyptians, who avoided harming cats due to religious belief
   and superstitions.

   Currying favor with supporters was the other side of psychological
   warfare, and an early practitioner of this was Alexander the Great, who
   successfully conquered large parts of Europe and the Middle East and held
   on to his territorial gains by co-opting local elites into the Greek
   administration and culture. Alexander left some of his men behind in each
   conquered city to introduce Greek culture and oppress dissident views. His
   soldiers were paid dowries to marry locals^[7] in an effort to encourage
   assimilation.

   Genghis Khan, leader of the Mongolian Empire in the 13th century AD
   employed less subtle techniques. Defeating the will of the enemy before
   having to attack and reaching a consented settlement was preferable to
   facing his wrath. The Mongol generals demanded submission to the Khan and
   threatened the initially captured villages with complete destruction if
   they refused to surrender. If they had to fight to take the settlement,
   the Mongol generals fulfilled their threats and massacred the survivors.
   Tales of the encroaching horde spread to the next villages and created an
   aura of insecurity that undermined the possibility of future
   resistance.^[8]

   Genghis Khan also employed tactics that made his numbers seem greater than
   they actually were. During night operations he ordered each soldier to
   light three torches at dusk to give the illusion of an overwhelming army
   and deceive and intimidate enemy scouts. He also sometimes had objects
   tied to the tails of his horses, so that riding on open and dry fields
   raised a cloud of dust that gave the enemy the impression of great
   numbers. His soldiers used arrows specially notched to whistle as they
   flew through the air, creating a terrifying noise.^[9]

   Another tactic favored by the Mongols was catapulting severed human heads
   over city walls to frighten the inhabitants and spread disease in the
   besieged city's closed confines. This was especially used by the
   later^[which?] Turko-Mongol chieftain.

   The Muslim caliph Omar, in his battles against the Byzantine Empire, sent
   small reinforcements in the form of a continuous stream, giving the
   impression that a large force would accumulate eventually if not swiftly
   dealt with.

   During the early Qin dynasty and late Eastern Zhou dynasty in 1st century
   AD China, the Empty Fort Strategy was used to trick the enemy into
   believing that an empty location was an ambush, in order to prevent them
   from attacking it using reverse psychology. This tactic also relied on
   luck, should the enemy believe that the location is a threat to them.

   In the 6th century BCE Greek Bias of Priene successfully resisted the
   Lydian king Alyattes by fattening up a pair of mules and driving them out
   of the besieged city.^[10] When Alyattes' envoy was then sent to Priene,
   Bias had piles of sand covered with wheat to give the impression of
   plentiful resources.

   This ruse appears to have been well known in medieval Europe: defenders in
   castles or towns under siege would throw food from the walls to show
   besiegers that provisions were plentiful. A famous example occurs in the
   8th-century legend of Lady Carcas, who supposedly persuaded the Franks to
   abandon a five-year siege by this means and gave her name to Carcassonne
   as a result.

   During the Granada War, Spanish captain Hernán Pérez del Pulgar routinely
   employed psychological tactics as part of his guerrilla actions against
   the Emirate of Granada. In 1490, infiltrating the city by night with a
   small retinue of soldiers, he nailed a letter of challenge on the main
   mosque and set fire to the alcaicería before withdrawing.^[11]

   In 1574, having been informed about the pirate attacks previous to the
   Battle of Manila, Spanish captain Juan de Salcedo had his relief force
   return to the city by night while playing marching music and carrying
   torches in loose formations, so they would appear to be a much larger army
   to any nearby enemy. They reached the city unopposed.^[12]

   During the Attack on Marstrand in 1719, Peter Tordenskjold carried out
   military deception against the Swedes. Although probably apocryphal, he
   apparently succeeded in making his small force appear larger and feed
   disinformation to his opponents, similar to the Operations Fortitude and
   Titanic in World War II.

  World War I[edit]

   [IMG]Lord Bryce led the commission of 1915 to document German atrocities
   committed against Belgian civilians.

   The start of modern psychological operations in war is generally dated to
   World War I. By that point, Western societies were increasingly educated
   and urbanized, and mass media was available in the form of large
   circulation newspapers and posters. It was also possible to transmit
   propaganda to the enemy via the use of airborne leaflets or through
   explosive delivery systems like modified artillery or mortar rounds.^[13]

   At the start of the war, the belligerents, especially the British and
   Germans, began distributing propaganda, both domestically and on the
   Western front. The British had several advantages that allowed them to
   succeed in the battle for world opinion; they had one of the world's most
   reputable news systems, with much experience in international and
   cross-cultural communication, and they controlled much of the undersea
   communications cable system then in operation. These capabilities were
   easily transitioned to the task of warfare.

   The British also had a diplomatic service that maintained good relations
   with many nations around the world, in contrast to the reputation of the
   German services.^[14] While German attempts to foment revolution in parts
   of the British Empire, such as Ireland and India, were ineffective,
   extensive experience in the Middle East allowed the British to
   successfully induce the Arabs to revolt against the Ottoman Empire.

   In August 1914, David Lloyd George appointed a Member of Parliament (MP),
   Charles Masterman, to head a Propaganda Agency at Wellington House. A
   distinguished body of literary talent was enlisted for the task, with its
   members including Arthur Conan Doyle, Ford Madox Ford, G. K. Chesterton,
   Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling and H. G. Wells. Over 1,160 pamphlets were
   published during the war and distributed to neutral countries, and
   eventually, to Germany. One of the first significant publications, the
   Report on Alleged German Outrages of 1915, had a great effect on general
   opinion across the world. The pamphlet documented atrocities, both actual
   and alleged, committed by the German army against Belgian civilians. A
   Dutch illustrator, Louis Raemaekers, provided the highly emotional
   drawings which appeared in the pamphlet.^[15]

   In 1917, the bureau was subsumed into the new Department of Information
   and branched out into telegraph communications, radio, newspapers,
   magazines and the cinema. In 1918, Viscount Northcliffe was appointed
   Director of Propaganda in Enemy Countries. The department was split
   between propaganda against Germany organized by H.G Wells, and propaganda
   against the Austro-Hungarian Empire supervised by Wickham Steed and Robert
   William Seton-Watson; the attempts of the latter focused on the lack of
   ethnic cohesion in the Empire and stoked the grievances of minorities such
   as the Croats and Slovenes. It had a significant effect on the final
   collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Army at the Battle of Vittorio
   Veneto.^[13]

   Aerial leaflets were dropped over German trenches containing postcards
   from prisoners of war detailing their humane conditions, surrender notices
   and general propaganda against the Kaiser and the German generals. By the
   end of the war, MI7b had distributed almost 26 million leaflets. The
   Germans began shooting the leaflet-dropping pilots, prompting the British
   to develop unmanned leaflet balloons that drifted across no-man's land. At
   least one in seven of these leaflets were not handed in by the soldiers to
   their superiors, despite severe penalties for that offence. Even General
   Hindenburg admitted that "Unsuspectingly, many thousands consumed the
   poison", and POWs admitted to being disillusioned by the propaganda
   leaflets that depicted the use of German troops as mere cannon fodder. In
   1915, the British began airdropping a regular leaflet newspaper Le
   Courrier de l'Air for civilians in German-occupied France and
   Belgium.^[16]

   At the start of the war, the French government took control of the media
   to suppress negative coverage. Only in 1916, with the establishment of the
   Maison de la Presse, did they begin to use similar tactics for the purpose
   of psychological warfare. One of its sections was the "Service de la
   Propagande aérienne" (Aerial Propaganda Service), headed by Professor
   Tonnelat and Jean-Jacques Waltz, an Alsatian artist code-named "Hansi".
   The French tended to distribute leaflets of images only, although the full
   publication of US President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, which had
   been heavily edited in the German newspapers, was distributed via airborne
   leaflets by the French.^[13]

   The Central Powers were slow to use these techniques; however, at the
   start of the war the Germans succeeded in inducing the Sultan of the
   Ottoman Empire to declare 'holy war', or Jihad, against the Western
   infidels. They also attempted to foment rebellion against the British
   Empire in places as far afield as Ireland, Afghanistan, and India. The
   Germans' greatest success was in giving the Russian revolutionary, Lenin,
   free transit on a sealed train from Switzerland to Finland after the
   overthrow of the Tsar. This soon paid off when the Bolshevik Revolution
   took Russia out of the war.^[17]

  World War II[edit]

   Adolf Hitler was greatly influenced by the psychological tactics of
   warfare the British had employed during World War I, and attributed the
   defeat of Germany to the effects this propaganda had on the soldiers. He
   became committed to the use of mass propaganda to influence the minds of
   the German population in the decades to come. By calling his movement The
   Third Reich, he was able to convince many civilians that his cause was not
   just a fad, but the way of their future. Joseph Goebbels was appointed as
   Propaganda Minister when Hitler came to power in 1933, and he portrayed
   Hitler as a messianic figure for the redemption of Germany. Hitler also
   coupled this with the resonating projections of his orations for effect.

   Germany's Fall Grün plan of invasion of Czechoslovakia had a large part
   dealing with psychological warfare aimed both at the Czechoslovak
   civilians and government as well as, crucially, at Czechoslovakia's
   allies.^[18] It became successful to the point that Germany gained support
   of UK and France through appeasement to occupy Czechoslovakia without
   having to fight an all-out war, sustaining only minimum losses in covert
   war before the Munich Agreement.

   At the start of the Second World War, the British set up the Political
   Warfare Executive to produce and distribute propaganda. Through the use of
   powerful transmitters, broadcasts could be made across Europe. Sefton
   Delmer managed a successful black propaganda campaign through several
   radio stations which were designed to be popular with German troops while
   at the same time introducing news material that would weaken their morale
   under a veneer of authenticity. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill
   made use of radio broadcasts for propaganda against the Germans. Churchill
   favoured deception; he said "In wartime, truth is so precious that she
   should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.".^[19]

   [IMG]Map depicting the targets of all the subordinate plans of Operation
   Bodyguard.

   During World War II, the British made extensive use of deception –
   developing many new techniques and theories. The main protagonists at this
   time were 'A' Force, set up in 1940 under Dudley Clarke, and the London
   Controlling Section, chartered in 1942 under the control of John
   Bevan.^[20]^[21] Clarke pioneered many of the strategies of military
   deception. His ideas for combining fictional orders of battle, visual
   deception and double agents helped define Allied deception strategy during
   the war, for which he has been referred to as "the greatest British
   deceiver of WW2".^[22]

   During the lead-up to the Allied invasion of Normandy, many new tactics in
   psychological warfare were devised. The plan for Operation Bodyguard set
   out a general strategy to mislead German high command as to the date and
   location of the invasion, which was obviously going to happen. Planning
   began in 1943 under the auspices of the London Controlling Section (LCS).
   A draft strategy, referred to as Plan Jael, was presented to Allied high
   command at the Tehran Conference. Operation Fortitude was intended to
   convince the Germans of a greater Allied military strength than was the
   case, through fictional field armies, faked operations to prepare the
   ground for invasion and "leaked" misinformation about the Allied order of
   battle and war plans.

   Elaborate naval deceptions (Operations Glimmer, Taxable and Big Drum) were
   undertaken in the English Channel.^[23] Small ships and aircraft simulated
   invasion fleets lying off Pas de Calais, Cap d'Antifer and the western
   flank of the real invasion force.^[24] At the same time Operation Titanic
   involved the RAF dropping fake paratroopers to the east and west of the
   Normandy landings.

   [IMG]A dummy Sherman tank, used to deceive the Germans.

   The deceptions were implemented with the use of double agents, radio
   traffic and visual deception. The British "Double Cross" anti-espionage
   operation had proven very successful from the outset of the war,^[25] and
   the LCS was able to use double agents to send back misleading information
   about Allied invasion plans.^[26] The use of visual deception, including
   mock tanks and other military hardware had been developed during the North
   Africa campaign. Mock hardware was created for Bodyguard; in particular,
   dummy landing craft were stockpiled to give the impression that the
   invasion would take place near Calais.

   The Operation was a strategic success and the Normandy landings caught
   German defences unawares. Continuing deception, portraying the landings as
   a diversion from a forthcoming main invasion in the Calais region, led
   Hitler into delaying transferring forces from Calais to the real
   battleground for nearly seven weeks.^[27]

  Vietnam War[edit]

   [IMG]"Viet Cong, beware!" – South Vietnam leaflets urging the defection of
   Viet Cong.

   The United States ran an extensive program of psychological warfare during
   the Vietnam War. The Phoenix Program had the dual aim of assassinating
   National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (NLF or Viet Cong) personnel
   and terrorizing any potential sympathizers or passive supporters. During
   the Phoenix Program, over 19,000 NLF supporters were killed.^[28] The
   United States also used tapes of distorted human sounds and played them
   during the night making the Vietnamese soldiers think that the dead were
   back for revenge.

   The Vietcong and their forces also used a program of psychological warfare
   during this war. Trịnh Thị Ngọ([ṯɕïŋ˧ˀ˨ʔ tʰi˧ˀ˨ʔ ŋɔ˧ˀ˨ʔ]; 1931 – 30
   September 2016), also known as Thu Hương and Hanoi Hannah, was a
   Vietnamese radio personality. She made English-language broadcasts for
   North Vietnam directed at United States troops. During the Vietnam War,
   Ngọ became famous among US soldiers for her propaganda broadcasts on Radio
   Hanoi. Her scripts were written by the North Vietnamese Army and were
   intended to frighten and shame the soldiers into leaving their posts. She
   made three broadcasts a day, reading a list of newly killed or imprisoned
   Americans, and playing popular US anti-war songs in an effort to incite
   feelings of nostalgia and homesickness, attempting to persuade US GIs that
   the US involvement in the Vietnam War was unjust and immoral.^[29] A
   typical broadcast began as follows:

     How are you, GI Joe? It seems to me that most of you are poorly informed
     about the going of the war, to say nothing about a correct explanation
     of your presence over here. Nothing is more confused than to be ordered
     into a war to die or to be maimed for life without the faintest idea of
     what's going on.^[30]

  21st century[edit]

   [IMG]An American PSYOP leaflet disseminated during the Iraq War. It shows
   a caricature of Al-Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi caught in a
   rat trap. The caption reads "This is your future, Zarqawi".

   The CIA made extensive use of Contra soldiers to destabilize the
   Sandinista government in Nicaragua.^[31] The CIA used psychological
   warfare techniques against the Panamanians by delivering unlicensed TV
   broadcasts. The United States government has used propaganda broadcasts
   against the Cuban government through TV Marti, based in Miami, Florida.
   However, the Cuban government has been successful at jamming the signal of
   TV Marti.

   In the Iraq War, the United States used the shock and awe campaign to
   psychologically maim and break the will of the Iraqi Army to fight.

   In cyberspace, social media has enabled the use of disinformation on a
   wide scale. Analysts have found evidence of doctored or misleading
   photographs spread by social media in the Syrian Civil War and 2014
   Russian military intervention in Ukraine, possibly with state
   involvement.^[32] Military and governments have engaged in psychological
   operations (PSYOP) and informational warfare (IW) on social networking
   platforms to regulate foreign propaganda, which includes countries like
   the US, Russia, and China.^[33]^[34]

   In 2022, Meta and the Stanford Internet Observatory found that over five
   years people associated with the U.S. military, who tried to conceal their
   identities, created fake accounts on social media systems including
   Balatarin, Facebook, Instagram, Odnoklassniki, Telegram, Twitter,
   VKontakte and YouTube in an influence operation in Central Asia and the
   Middle East. Their posts, primarily in Arabic, Farsi and Russian,
   criticized Iran, China and Russia and gave pro-Western narratives. Data
   suggested the activity was a series of covert campaigns rather than a
   single operation.^[35]^[36]

   In operations in the South and East China Seas, both the United States and
   China have been engaged in "Cognitive Warfare", which involves both
   displays of force, staged photographs and sharing of
   disinformation.^[37]^[38]^[39]

   Most modern uses of the term psychological warfare refer to the following
   military methods:

     * Demoralization:
          * Distributing pamphlets that encourage desertion or supply
            instructions on how to surrender.
          * Shock and awe military strategy.
          * Projecting repetitive and disturbing noises and music for long
            periods at high volume towards groups under siege like during
            Operation Nifty Package.
     * Propaganda radio stations, such as Lord Haw-Haw in World War II on the
       "Germany calling" station.
     * Renaming cities and other places when captured, such as the renaming
       of Saigon to Ho Chi Minh City after Communist victory in the Vietnam
       War.
     * False flag events.
     * Terrorism^[40]
     * The threat of chemical weapons.^[41]
     * Information warfare.

   Most of these techniques were developed during World War II or earlier,
   and have been used to some degree in every conflict since. Daniel Lerner
   was in the OSS (the predecessor to the American CIA) and in his book,
   attempts to analyze how effective the various strategies were. He
   concludes that there is little evidence that any of them were dramatically
   successful, except perhaps surrender instructions over loudspeakers when
   victory was imminent. Measuring the success or failure of psychological
   warfare is very hard, as the conditions are very far from being a
   controlled experiment.

   Lerner also divides psychological warfare operations into three
   categories:^[42]^[page needed]

     * White propaganda (omissions and emphasis): Truthful and not strongly
       biased, where the source of information is acknowledged.
     * Grey propaganda (omissions, emphasis and racial/ethnic/religious
       bias): Largely truthful, containing no information that can be proven
       wrong; the source is not identified.
     * Black propaganda (commissions of falsification): Inherently deceitful,
       information given in the product is attributed to a source that was
       not responsible for its creation.

   Lerner says grey and black operations ultimately have a heavy cost, in
   that the target population sooner or later recognizes them as propaganda
   and discredits the source. He writes, "This is one of the few dogmas
   advanced by Sykewarriors that is likely to endure as an axiom of
   propaganda: Credibility is a condition of persuasion. Before you can make
   a man do as you say, you must make him believe what you say."^[42]^: 28 
   Consistent with this idea, the Allied strategy in World War II was
   predominantly one of truth (with certain exceptions).^[citation needed]

   In Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes, Jacques Ellul discusses
   psychological warfare as a common peace policy practice between nations as
   a form of indirect aggression. This type of propaganda drains the public
   opinion of an opposing regime by stripping away its power on public
   opinion. This form of aggression is hard to defend against because no
   international court of justice is capable of protecting against
   psychological aggression since it cannot be legally adjudicated.

     "Here the propagandists is [sic] dealing with a foreign adversary whose
     morale he seeks to destroy by psychological means so that the opponent
     begins to doubt the validity of his beliefs and actions."^[43]^[44]

By country[edit]

  China[edit]

   According to U.S. military analysts, attacking the enemy's mind is an
   important element of the People's Republic of China's military
   strategy.^[45]^[46]^[47] This type of warfare is rooted in the Chinese
   Stratagems outlined by Sun Tzu in The Art of War and Thirty-Six
   Stratagems. In its dealings with its rivals, China is expected to utilize
   Marxism to mobilize communist loyalists, as well as flex its economic and
   military muscle to persuade other nations to act in the Chinese
   government's interests. The Chinese government also tries to control the
   media to keep a tight hold on propaganda efforts for its people.^[47] The
   Chinese government also utilizes cognitive warfare against Taiwan.^[48]

  France[edit]

   The Centre interarmées des actions sur l'environnement is an organization
   made up of 300 soldiers whose mission is to assure to the four service arm
   of the French Armed Forces psychological warfare capacities. Deployed in
   particular to Mali and Afghanistan, its missions "consist in better
   explaining and accepting the action of French forces in operation with
   local actors and thus gaining their trust: direct aid to the populations,
   management of reconstruction sites, actions of communication of influence
   with the population, elites and local elected officials". The center has
   capacities for analysis, influence, expertise and instruction.^[49]

  Germany[edit]

   In the German Bundeswehr, the Zentrum Operative Kommunikation is
   responsible PSYOP efforts. The center is subordinate to the Cyber and
   Information Domain Service branch alongside multiple IT and Electronic
   Warfare battalions and consists of around 1000 soldiers. One project of
   the German PSYOP forces is the radio station Stimme der Freiheit (Sada-e
   Azadi, Voice of Freedom),^[50] heard by thousands of Afghans. Another is
   the publication of various newspapers and magazines in Kosovo and
   Afghanistan, where German soldiers serve with NATO.

  Iran[edit]

   The Iranian government had an operation program to use the 2022 FIFA World
   Cup as a psyop against concurrent people's
   protests.^[51]^[52]^[53]^[54]^[55]

  Israel[edit]

   The Israeli government and its military make use of psychological warfare.
   In 2021, Israeli newspaper Haaretz revealed that "Abu Ali Express", a
   popular news page on Telegram and Twitter purportedly dedicated to "Arab
   affairs", was actually run by a Jewish Israeli paid consultant to the
   Israel Defense Forces. The IDF's psyops account had been the source of a
   number of noteworthy reports that were afterwards cited by the Israeli and
   international media. Abu Ali Express was, for example, the source for the
   report that Qatari funds were entering the Gaza Strip in suitcases.^[56]

  United Kingdom[edit]

   The British were one of the first major military powers to use
   psychological warfare in the First and Second World Wars. In the current
   British Armed Forces, PsyOps are handled by the tri-service 15
   Psychological Operations Group. (See also MI5 and Secret Intelligence
   Service). The Psychological Operations Group comprises over 150 personnel,
   approximately 75 from the regular Armed Services and 75 from the Reserves.
   The Group supports deployed commanders in the provision of psychological
   operations in operational and tactical environments.^[57]^[58]

   The Group was established immediately after the 1991 Gulf War,^[59] has
   since grown significantly in size to meet operational requirements,^[60]
   and since 2015 has been one of the sub-units of the 77th Brigade, formerly
   called the Security Assistance Group.^[61]

   In June 2015, NSA files published by Glenn Greenwald revealed details of
   the JTRIG group at British intelligence agency GCHQ covertly manipulating
   online communities.^[62] This is in line with JTRIG's goal: to "destroy,
   deny, degrade [and] disrupt" enemies by "discrediting" them, planting
   misinformation and shutting down their communications.^[63]

   In March 2019, it emerged that the Defence Science and Technology
   Laboratory (DSTL) of the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) is tendering to
   arms companies and universities for £70M worth of assistance under a
   project to develop new methods of psychological warfare. The project is
   known as the human and social sciences research capability (HSSRC).^[64]

   The term psychological warfare is believed to have migrated from Germany
   to the United States in 1941.^[65] During World War II, the United States
   Joint Chiefs of Staff defined psychological warfare broadly, stating
   "Psychological warfare employs any weapon to influence the mind of the
   enemy. The weapons are psychological only in the effect they produce and
   not because of the weapons themselves."^[66] The U.S. Department of
   Defense currently defines psychological warfare as:

     "The planned use of propaganda and other psychological actions having
     the primary purpose of influencing the opinions, emotions, attitudes,
     and behavior of hostile foreign groups in such a way as to support the
     achievement of national objectives."^[67]

   This definition indicates that a critical element of the U.S.
   psychological operations capabilities includes propaganda and by extension
   counterpropaganda. Joint Publication 3–53 establishes specific policy to
   use public affairs mediums to counter propaganda from foreign
   origins.^[68]

   The purpose of United States psychological operations is to induce or
   reinforce attitudes and behaviors favorable to US objectives. The Special
   Activities Center (SAC) is a division of the Central Intelligence Agency's
   National Clandestine Service, responsible for Covert Action and "Special
   Activities". These special activities include covert political influence
   (which includes psychological operations) and paramilitary
   operations.^[69] SAC's political influence group is the only US unit
   allowed to conduct these operations covertly and is considered the primary
   unit in this area.^[69]

   Dedicated psychological operations units exist in the United States Army
   and United States Marine Corps. The United States Navy and the 193rd
   Special Operations Wing of the United States Air Force also plans and
   executes limited PSYOP missions. United States PSYOP units and soldiers of
   all branches of the military are prohibited by law from targeting U.S.
   citizens with PSYOP within the borders of the United States (Executive
   Order S-1233, DOD Directive S-3321.1, and National Security Decision
   Directive 130). While United States Army PSYOP units may offer non-PSYOP
   support to domestic military missions, they can only target foreign
   audiences.

   A U.S. Army field manual released in January 2013 states that "Inform and
   Influence Activities" are critical for describing, directing, and leading
   military operations. Several Army Division leadership staff are assigned
   to “planning, integration and synchronization of designated
   information-related capabilities."^[70]

   In September 2022, an audit of covert information warfare took place after
   social media companies identified a suspected U.S. military
   operation.^[71]
