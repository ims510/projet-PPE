   War is an intense armed conflict^[a] between states, governments,
   societies, or paramilitary groups such as mercenaries, insurgents, and
   militias. It is generally characterized by extreme violence,
   destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces.
   Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of
   war, or of wars in general.^[2] Total war is warfare that is not
   restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in
   massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties.

   While some war studies scholars consider war a universal and ancestral
   aspect of human nature,^[3] others argue it is a result of specific
   socio-cultural, economic, or ecological circumstances.^[4]

Etymology

   [350px-Gari-Melchers-War-Highsmith.jpeg] Mural of War (1896), by Gari
   Melchers

   The English word war derives from the 11th-century Old English words
   wyrre and werre, from Old French werre (also guerre as in modern
   French), in turn from the Frankish *werra, ultimately deriving from the
   Proto-Germanic *werzō 'mixture, confusion'. The word is related to the
   Old Saxon werran, Old High German werran, and the modern German
   verwirren, meaning 'to confuse, to perplex, to bring into
   confusion'.^[5]

History

   Main article: Military history

   [310px-War_deaths_caused_by_warfare.svg.png] The percentages of men
   killed in war in eight tribal societies, and Europe and the U.S. in the
   20th century. (Lawrence H. Keeley,
   archeologist)[170px-Ramesseum_siege_of_Dapur.jpg] The Egyptian siege of
   Dapur in the 13th century BCE, from Ramesseum, Thebes.

   The earliest evidence of prehistoric warfare is a Mesolithic cemetery
   in Jebel Sahaba, which has been determined to be about 13,400 years
   old.^[6] About forty-five percent of the skeletons there displayed
   signs of violent death, specifically traumatic bone lesions.^[7]

   Since the rise of the state some 5,000 years ago,^[8] military activity
   has occurred over much of the globe. Estimates for total deaths due to
   war vary wildly. For the period 3000 BCE until 1991, estimates range
   from 145 million to 2 billion.^[9] In one estimate, primitive warfare
   prior to 3000 BCE has been thought to have claimed 400 million victims
   based on the assumption that it accounted for the 15.1% of all
   deaths.^[10] For comparison, an estimated 1,680,000,000 people died
   from infectious diseases in the 20th century.^[11]

   In War Before Civilization, Lawrence H. Keeley, a professor at the
   University of Illinois, says approximately 90–95% of known societies
   throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare,^[12] and
   many fought constantly.^[13]

   Keeley describes several styles of primitive combat such as small
   raids, large raids, and massacres. All of these forms of warfare were
   used by primitive societies, a finding supported by other
   researchers.^[14] Keeley explains that early war raids were not well
   organized, as the participants did not have any formal training.
   Scarcity of resources meant defensive works were not a cost-effective
   way to protect the society against enemy raids.^[15]

   William Rubinstein wrote "Pre-literate societies, even those organized
   in a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied
   cruelty.'"^[16] The invention of gunpowder, and its eventual use in
   warfare, together with the acceleration of technological advances have
   fomented major changes to war itself.

   ship, 13th century

   In Western Europe, since the late 18th century, more than 150 conflicts
   and about 600 battles have taken place.^[17] During the 20th century,
   war resulted in a dramatic intensification of the pace of social
   changes, and was a crucial catalyst for the growth of left-wing
   politics.^[18]

   the Winter War.

   In 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences
   of modern warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences
   and costs of the newly developed atom bomb, Albert Einstein famously
   stated, "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but
   World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."^[19]

   Mao Zedong urged the socialist camp not to fear nuclear war with the
   United States since, even if "half of mankind died, the other half
   would remain while imperialism would be razed to the ground and the
   whole world would become socialist."^[20]

   A distinctive feature of war since 1945 is that combat has largely been
   a matter of civil wars and insurgencies.^[21] The major exceptions were
   the Korean War, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Iran–Iraq War, the
   Gulf War, the Eritrean–Ethiopian War, and the Russo-Ukrainian War.

   The Human Security Report 2005 documented a significant decline in the
   number and severity of armed conflicts since the end of the Cold War in
   the early 1990s. However, the evidence examined in the 2008 edition of
   the Center for International Development and Conflict Management's
   "Peace and Conflict" study indicated the overall decline in conflicts
   had stalled.^[22]

Types of warfare

   Main article: Types of war

     * Asymmetric warfare is the methods used in conflicts between
       belligerents of drastically different levels of military capability
       or size.^[23]
     * Biological warfare, or germ warfare, is the use of biological
       infectious agents or toxins such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi
       against people, plants, or animals. This can be conducted through
       sophisticated technologies, like cluster munitions,^[24] or with
       rudimentary techniques like catapulting an infected corpse behind
       enemy lines,^[25] and can include weaponized or non-weaponized
       pathogens.
     * Chemical warfare involves the use of weaponized chemicals in
       combat. Poison gas as a chemical weapon was principally used during
       World War I, and resulted in over a million estimated casualties,
       including more than 100,000 civilians.^[26]
     * Cold warfare is an intense international rivalry without direct
       military conflict, but with a sustained threat of it, including
       high levels of military preparations, expenditures, and
       development, and may involve active conflicts by indirect means,
       such as economic warfare, political warfare, covert operations,
       espionage, cyberwarfare, or proxy wars.
     * Conventional warfare is declared war between states in which
       nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons are not used or see
       limited deployment.
     * Cyberwarfare involves the actions by a nation-state or
       international organization to attack and attempt to damage another
       nation's information systems.
     * Insurgency is a rebellion against authority, when those taking part
       in the rebellion are not recognized as belligerents (lawful
       combatants). An insurgency can be fought via counterinsurgency, and
       may also be opposed by measures to protect the population, and by
       political and economic actions of various kinds aimed at
       undermining the insurgents' claims against the incumbent regime.
     * Information warfare is the application of destructive force on a
       large scale against information assets and systems, against the
       computers and networks that support the four critical
       infrastructures (the power grid, communications, financial, and
       transportation).^[27]
     * Nuclear warfare is warfare in which nuclear weapons are the
       primary, or a major, method of achieving capitulation.
     * Total war is warfare by any means possible, disregarding the laws
       of war, placing no limits on legitimate military targets, using
       weapons and tactics resulting in significant civilian casualties,
       or demanding a war effort requiring significant sacrifices by the
       friendly civilian population.
     * Unconventional warfare, the opposite of conventional warfare, is an
       attempt to achieve military victory through acquiescence,
       capitulation, or clandestine support for one side of an existing
       conflict.

Aims

   States Army soldiers engaged in a firefight with Taliban insurgents
   during the War in Afghanistan, 2009

   Entities contemplating going to war and entities considering whether to
   end a war may formulate war aims as an evaluation/propaganda tool. War
   aims may stand as a proxy for national-military resolve.^[28]

  Definition

   Fried defines war aims as "the desired territorial, economic, military
   or other benefits expected following successful conclusion of a
   war".^[29]

  Classification

   Tangible/intangible aims:
     * Tangible war aims may involve (for example) the acquisition of
       territory (as in the German goal of Lebensraum in the first half of
       the 20th century) or the recognition of economic concessions (as in
       the Anglo-Dutch Wars).
     * Intangible war aims – like the accumulation of credibility or
       reputation^[30] – may have more tangible expression ("conquest
       restores prestige, annexation increases power").^[31]

   Explicit/implicit aims:
     * Explicit war aims may involve published policy decisions.
     * Implicit war aims^[32] can take the form of minutes of discussion,
       memoranda and instructions.^[33]

   Positive/negative aims:
     * "Positive war aims" cover tangible outcomes.
     * "Negative war aims" forestall or prevent undesired outcomes.^[34]

   War aims can change in the course of conflict and may eventually morph
   into "peace conditions"^[35] – the minimal conditions under which a
   state may cease to wage a particular war.

   Throughout the course of human history, the average number of people
   dying from war has fluctuated relatively little, being about 1 to 10
   people dying per 100,000. However, major wars over shorter periods have
   resulted in much higher casualty rates, with 100–200 casualties per
   100,000 over a few years. While conventional wisdom holds that
   casualties have increased in recent times due to technological
   improvements in warfare, this is not generally true. For instance, the
   Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) had about the same number of casualties
   per capita as World War I, although it was higher during World War II
   (WWII). That said, overall the number of casualties from war has not
   significantly increased in recent times. Quite to the contrary, on a
   global scale the time since WWII has been unusually peaceful.^[38]

  Largest by death toll

   Main articles: List of wars by death toll, Outline of war § Wars, and
   Casualty recording

   The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of
   deaths since its start, is World War II, from 1939 to 1945, with
   70–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests^[39] at up to
   60 million. As concerns a belligerent's losses in proportion to its
   prewar population, the most destructive war in modern history may have
   been the Paraguayan War (see Paraguayan War casualties). In 2013 war
   resulted in 31,000 deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990.^[40] War
   usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the
   ecosystem, a decrease in social spending, famine, large-scale
   emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of prisoners
   of war or civilians.^[41]^[42]^[43] For instance, of the nine million
   people who were on the territory of the Byelorussian SSR in 1941, some
   1.6 million were killed by the Germans in actions away from
   battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 Jews,
   and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were
   unarmed civilians).^[44] Another byproduct of some wars is the
   prevalence of propaganda by some or all parties in the conflict,^[45]
   and increased revenues by weapons manufacturers.^[46]

   Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been
   waged in the last century. These are the two World Wars, followed by
   the Second Sino-Japanese War (which is sometimes considered part of
   World War II, or as overlapping). Most of the others involved China or
   neighboring peoples. The death toll of World War II, being over
   60 million, surpasses all other war-death-tolls.^[47]

  On military personnel

   Military personnel subject to combat in war often suffer mental and
   physical injuries, including depression, posttraumatic stress disorder,
   disease, injury, and death.

     In every war in which American soldiers have fought in, the chances
     of becoming a psychiatric casualty – of being debilitated for some
     period of time as a consequence of the stresses of military life –
     were greater than the chances of being killed by enemy fire.

   — No More Heroes, Richard Gabriel^[17]

   Swank and Marchand's World War II study found that after sixty days of
   continuous combat, 98% of all surviving military personnel will become
   psychiatric casualties. Psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in
   fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety,
   obsessional and compulsive states, and character disorders.^[60]

     One-tenth of mobilised American men were hospitalised for mental
     disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and after thirty-five days of
     uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric
     disturbances in varying degrees.

   Apotheosis of War (1871) by Vasily Vereshchagin

   Additionally, it has been estimated anywhere from 18% to 54% of Vietnam
   war veterans suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder.^[60]

   Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white American males aged 13 to
   43 died in the American Civil War, including about 6% in the North and
   approximately 18% in the South.^[61] The war remains the deadliest
   conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000
   military personnel. United States military casualties of war since 1775
   have totaled over two million. Of the 60 million European military
   personnel who were mobilized in World War I, 8 million were killed,
   7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously
   injured.^[62]
   [220px-DeadCrowIndians1874.jpg] The remains of dead Crow Indians killed
   and scalped by Sioux c. 1874

   During Napoleon's retreat from Moscow, more French military personnel
   died of typhus than were killed by the Russians.^[63] Of the 450,000
   soldiers who crossed the Neman on 25 June 1812, less than 40,000
   returned. More military personnel were killed from 1500 to 1914 by
   typhus than from military action.^[64] In addition, if it were not for
   modern medical advances there would be thousands more dead from disease
   and infection. For instance, during the Seven Years' War, the Royal
   Navy reported it conscripted 184,899 sailors, of whom 133,708 (72%)
   died of disease or were 'missing'.^[65]

   It is estimated that between 1985 and 1994, 378,000 people per year
   died due to war.^[66]

  On civilians

   See also: Civilian casualties

   [220px-Hanging_from_The_Miseries_and_Misfortunes_of_War_by_Jacques_Call
   ot.jpg] Les Grandes Misères de la guerre depict the destruction
   unleashed on civilians during the Thirty Years' War.

   Most wars have resulted in significant loss of life, along with
   destruction of infrastructure and resources (which may lead to famine,
   disease, and death in the civilian population). During the Thirty
   Years' War in Europe, the population of the Holy Roman Empire was
   reduced by 15 to 40 percent.^[67]^[68] Civilians in war zones may also
   be subject to war atrocities such as genocide, while survivors may
   suffer the psychological aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of
   war. War also results in lower quality of life and worse health
   outcomes. A medium-sized conflict with about 2,500 battle deaths
   reduces civilian life expectancy by one year and increases infant
   mortality by 10% and malnutrition by 3.3%. Additionally, about 1.8% of
   the population loses access to drinking water.^[69]

   Most estimates of World War II casualties indicate around 60 million
   people died, 40 million of whom were civilians.^[70] Deaths in the
   Soviet Union were around 27 million.^[71] Since a high proportion of
   those killed were young men who had not yet fathered any children,
   population growth in the postwar Soviet Union was much lower than it
   otherwise would have been.^[72]

  Economic

   See also: Military Keynesianism

   Once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay war
   reparations to the victorious nations. In certain cases, land is ceded
   to the victorious nations. For example, the territory of
   Alsace-Lorraine has been traded between France and Germany on three
   different occasions.^[73]

   Typically, war becomes intertwined with the economy and many wars are
   partially or entirely based on economic reasons. Following World War
   II, consensus opinion for many years amongst economists and historians
   was that war can stimulate a country's economy as evidenced by the
   U.S's emergence from the Great Depression,^[74] though modern economic
   analysis has thrown significant doubt on these views. In most cases,
   such as the wars of Louis XIV, the Franco-Prussian War, and World War
   I, warfare primarily results in damage to the economy of the countries
   involved. For example, Russia's involvement in World War I took such a
   toll on the Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly
   contributed to the start of the Russian Revolution of 1917.^[75]

    World War II

   [170px-Cyprian_War.jpg] Ruins of Warsaw's Napoleon Square in the
   aftermath of World War II

   World War II was the most financially costly conflict in history; its
   belligerents cumulatively spent about a trillion U.S. dollars on the
   war effort (as adjusted to 1940 prices).^[76]^[77] The Great Depression
   of the 1930s ended as nations increased their production of war
   materials.^[78]

   By the end of the war, 70% of European industrial infrastructure was
   destroyed.^[79] Property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the
   Axis invasion was estimated at a value of 679 billion rubles. The
   combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710
   cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings,
   31,850 industrial establishments, 40,000 mi (64,374 km) of railroad,
   4100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000
   public libraries.^[80]

Theories of motivation

   See also: International relations theory

   [170px-Szigetvar_1566.jpg] The Ottoman campaign for territorial
   expansion in Europe in 1566

   There are many theories about the motivations for war, but no consensus
   about which are most common.^[81] Military theorist Carl von Clausewitz
   said, "Every age has its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions,
   and its own peculiar preconceptions."^[82]

  Psychoanalytic

   Dutch psychoanalyst Joost Meerloo held that, "War is often...a mass
   discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of
   mankind are discharged in mass destruction."^[83]

   Other psychoanalysts such as E.F.M. Durban and John Bowlby have argued
   human beings are inherently violent.^[84] This aggressiveness is fueled
   by displacement and projection where a person transfers his or her
   grievances into bias and hatred against other races, religions, nations
   or ideologies. By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the
   local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare.

   The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of Melanie Klein,
   thought war was the paranoid or projective "elaboration" of
   mourning.^[85] Fornari thought war and violence develop out of our
   "love need": our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which
   we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. For
   the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare.
   Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing
   willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over
   their bodies to their nation.

   Despite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for
   self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war,
   few wars have originated from a desire for war among the general
   populace.^[86] Far more often the general population has been
   reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory that
   looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh.^[87] He argues the
   general populace is more neutral towards war and wars occur when
   leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are
   placed into power. War is caused by leaders who seek war such as
   Napoleon and Hitler. Such leaders most often come to power in times of
   crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the
   nation to war.

     Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor
     in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is
     understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who
     determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the
     people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or
     a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. ... the people can always
     be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have
     to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the
     pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.
     It works the same way in any country.

   — Hermann Göring at the Nuremberg trials, 18 April 1946^[88]

   [220px-Aftermath_Battle_of_Triboltingen.jpg] Women and priests retrieve

   Constance after the battle of Schwaderloh. (Luzerner Schilling)

   Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are
   two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging in or after
   the Mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater
   population density and competition over resources; the other sees human
   warfare as a more ancient practice derived from common animal
   tendencies, such as territoriality and sexual competition.^[89]

   The latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found
   in many primate species such as chimpanzees,^[90] as well as in many
   ant species,^[91] group conflict may be a general feature of animal
   social behavior. Some proponents of the idea argue that war, while
   innate, has been intensified greatly by developments of technology and
   social organization such as weaponry and states.^[92]

   Psychologist and linguist Steven Pinker argued that war-related
   behaviors may have been naturally selected in the ancestral environment
   due to the benefits of victory.^[b] He also argued that in order to
   have credible deterrence against other groups (as well as on an
   individual level), it was important to have a reputation for
   retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for revenge as well as
   for protecting a group's (or an individual's) reputation ("honor").^[b]
   [260px-Reproduction_of_Bonampak_murals_%28panorama%29.JPG] Increasing
   population and constant warfare among the Maya city-states over
   resources may have contributed to the eventual collapse of the Maya
   civilization by 900 CE.

   Crofoot and Wrangham have argued that warfare, if defined as group
   interactions in which "coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or
   kill members of other groups", is a characteristic of most human
   societies. Those in which it has been lacking "tend to be societies
   that were politically dominated by their neighbors".^[94]

   Ashley Montagu strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments,
   arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important
   in determining the nature and presence of warfare. Thus, he argues,
   warfare is not a universal human occurrence and appears to have been a
   historical invention, associated with certain types of human
   societies.^[95] Montagu's argument is supported by ethnographic
   research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems
   to be entirely absent, e.g. the Chewong and Semai of the Malay
   peninsula.^[96] Bobbi S. Low has observed correlation between warfare
   and education, noting societies where warfare is commonplace encourage
   their children to be more aggressive.^[97]

   See also: Resource war

   War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive
   international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets
   for natural resources and for wealth. War has also been linked to
   economic development by economic historians and development economists
   studying state-building and fiscal capacity.^[98] While this theory has
   been applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less
   valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the
   distributions of wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is
   relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars. There
   are those on the extreme right of the political spectrum who provide
   support, fascists in particular, by asserting a natural right of a
   strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force.^[99]^[100]
   Some centrist, capitalist, world leaders, including Presidents of the
   United States and U.S. Generals, expressed support for an economic view
   of war.

  Marxist

   Main article: Marxist explanations of warfare

   The Marxist theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states all
   modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between
   great (imperialist) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of
   capitalism. Marxist economists Karl Kautsky, Rosa Luxemburg, Rudolf
   Hilferding and Vladimir Lenin theorized that imperialism was the result
   of capitalist countries needing new markets. Expansion of the means of
   production is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in
   consumer demand. Since the workers in a capitalist economy would be
   unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist
   markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving
   imperialism.^[101]

  Demographic

   Demographic theories can be grouped into two classes, Malthusian and
   youth bulge theories:

    Malthusian

   [220px-Aerial_view_of_a_US_helicopter_as_it_flies_over_a_Mogadishu_resi
   dential_area.JPEG] A U.S. Marine Corps helicopter on patrol in Somalia
   as part of the Unified Task Force, 1992

   Malthusian theories see expanding population and scarce resources as a
   source of violent conflict.

   Pope Urban II in 1095, on the eve of the First Crusade, advocating
   Crusade as a solution to European overpopulation, said:

     For this land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea
     and the mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population; it
     scarcely furnishes food enough for its cultivators. Hence it is that
     you murder and devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many
     among you perish in civil strife. Let hatred, therefore, depart from
     among you; let your quarrels end. Enter upon the road to the Holy
     Sepulchre; wrest that land from a wicked race, and subject it to
     yourselves.^[102]

   This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called
   the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding
   populations and limited resources. Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) wrote
   that populations always increase until they are limited by war,
   disease, or famine.^[103]

   The violent herder–farmer conflicts in Nigeria, Mali, Sudan and other
   countries in the Sahel region have been exacerbated by land degradation
   and population growth.^[104]^[105]^[106]

    Youth bulge

   [310px-2017_world_map%2C_median_age_by_country.svg.png] Median age by
   country. War reduces life expectancy. A youth bulge is evident for
   Africa, and to a lesser extent in some countries in West Asia, South
   Asia, Southeast Asia and Central America.

   According to Heinsohn, who proposed youth bulge theory in its most
   generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the
   males of a nation belong to the "fighting age" cohorts from 15 to 29
   years of age. It will follow periods with total fertility rates as high
   as 4–8 children per woman with a 15–29-year delay.^[107]^[108]

   Heinsohn saw both past "Christianist" European colonialism and
   imperialism, as well as today's Islamist civil unrest and terrorism as
   results of high birth rates producing youth bulges.^[109] Among
   prominent historical events that have been attributed to youth bulges
   are the role played by the historically large youth cohorts in the
   rebellion and revolution waves of early modern Europe, including the
   French Revolution of 1789,^[110] and the effect of economic depression
   upon the largest German youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of
   Nazism in Germany in the 1930s.^[111] The 1994 Rwandan genocide has
   also been analyzed as following a massive youth bulge.^[112]

   Youth bulge theory has been subjected to statistical analysis by the
   World Bank,^[113] Population Action International,^[114] and the Berlin
   Institute for Population and Development.^[115] Youth bulge theories
   have been criticized as leading to racial, gender and age
   discrimination.^[116]

  Cultural

   Geoffrey Parker argues that what distinguishes the "Western way of war"
   based in Western Europe chiefly allows historians to explain its
   extraordinary success in conquering most of the world after 1500:

     The Western way of war rests upon five principal foundations:
     technology, discipline, a highly aggressive military tradition, a
     remarkable capacity to innovate and to respond rapidly to the
     innovation of others and – from about 1500 onward – a unique system
     of war finance. The combination of all five provided a formula for
     military success....The outcome of wars has been determined less by
     technology, then by better war plans, the achievement of surprise,
     greater economic strength, and above all superior discipline.^[117]

   Parker argues that Western armies were stronger because they emphasized
   discipline, that is, "the ability of a formation to stand fast in the
   face of the enemy, where they're attacking or being attacked, without
   giving way to the natural impulse of fear and panic." Discipline came
   from drills and marching in formation, target practice, and creating
   small "artificial kinship groups: such as the company and the platoon,
   to enhance psychological cohesion and combat efficiency.^[118]

  Rationalist

   [220px-U.S._Marines_in_Operation_Allen_Brook_%28Vietnam_War%29_001.jpg]

   during the Vietnam War, 8 May 1968

   Rationalism is an international relations theory or framework.
   Rationalism (and Neorealism (international relations)) operate under
   the assumption that states or international actors are rational, seek
   the best possible outcomes for themselves, and desire to avoid the
   costs of war.^[119] Under one game theory approach, rationalist
   theories posit all actors can bargain, would be better off if war did
   not occur, and likewise seek to understand why war nonetheless
   reoccurs. Under another rationalist game theory without bargaining, the
   peace war game, optimal strategies can still be found that depend upon
   number of iterations played. In "Rationalist Explanations for War",
   James Fearon examined three rationalist explanations for why some
   countries engage in war:
     * Issue indivisibilities
     * Incentives to misrepresent or information asymmetry
     * Commitment problems^[119]

   "Issue indivisibility" occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by
   bargaining, because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be
   shared between them, but only owned entirely by one side or the other.

   "Information asymmetry with incentives to misrepresent" occurs when two
   countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not
   agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of
   state's victory or loss. For instance, Geoffrey Blainey argues that war
   is a result of miscalculation of strength. He cites historical examples
   of war and demonstrates, "war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic
   crisis which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting
   estimates of their bargaining power."^[120] Thirdly, bargaining may
   fail due to the states' inability to make credible commitments.^[121]

   Within the rationalist tradition, some theorists have suggested that
   individuals engaged in war suffer a normal level of cognitive
   bias,^[122] but are still "as rational as you and me".^[123] According
   to philosopher Iain King, "Most instigators of conflict overrate their
   chances of success, while most participants underrate their chances of
   injury...."^[124] King asserts that "Most catastrophic military
   decisions are rooted in groupthink" which is faulty, but still
   rational.^[125]

   The rationalist theory focused around bargaining is currently under
   debate. The Iraq War proved to be an anomaly that undercuts the
   validity of applying rationalist theory to some wars.^[126]

  Political science

   The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by Lewis Fry Richardson
   following World War I. More recent databases of wars and armed conflict
   have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project, Peter Brecke and
   the Uppsala Conflict Data Program.^[127]

   The following subsections consider causes of war from system, societal,
   and individual levels of analysis. This kind of division was first
   proposed by Kenneth Waltz in Man, the State, and War and has been often
   used by political scientists since then.^[128]^: 143 

    System-level

   There are several different international relations theory schools.
   Supporters of realism in international relations argue that the
   motivation of states is the quest for security, and conflicts can arise
   from the inability to distinguish defense from offense, which is called
   the security dilemma.^[128]^: 145 

   Within the realist school as represented by scholars such as Henry
   Kissinger and Hans Morgenthau, and the neorealist school represented by
   scholars such as Kenneth Waltz and John Mearsheimer, two main
   sub-theories are:
    1. Balance of power theory: States have the goal of preventing a
       single state from becoming a hegemon, and war is the result of the
       would-be hegemon's persistent attempts at power acquisition. In
       this view, an international system with more equal distribution of
       power is more stable, and "movements toward unipolarity are
       destabilizing."^[128]^: 147  However, evidence has shown power
       polarity is not actually a major factor in the occurrence of
       wars.^[128]^: 147–48 
    2. Power transition theory: Hegemons impose stabilizing conditions on
       the world order, but they eventually decline, and war occurs when a
       declining hegemon is challenged by another rising power or aims to
       preemptively suppress them.^[128]^: 148  On this view, unlike for
       balance-of-power theory, wars become more probable when power is
       more equally distributed. This "power preponderance" hypothesis has
       empirical support.^[128]^: 148 

   The two theories are not mutually exclusive and may be used to explain
   disparate events according to the circumstance.^[128]^: 148 

   Liberalism as it relates to international relations emphasizes factors
   such as trade, and its role in disincentivizing conflict which will
   damage economic relations. Realists^[who?] respond that military force
   may sometimes be at least as effective as trade at achieving economic
   benefits, especially historically if not as much today.^[128]^: 149 
   Furthermore, trade relations which result in a high level of dependency
   may escalate tensions and lead to conflict.^[128]^: 150  Empirical data
   on the relationship of trade to peace are mixed, and moreover, some
   evidence suggests countries at war do not necessarily trade less with
   each other.^[128]^: 150 

    Societal-level

     * Diversionary theory, also known as the "scapegoat hypothesis",
       suggests the politically powerful may use war to as a diversion or
       to rally domestic popular support.^[128]^: 152  This is supported
       by literature showing out-group hostility enhances in-group
       bonding, and a significant domestic "rally effect" has been
       demonstrated when conflicts begin.^[128]^: 152–13  However, studies
       examining the increased use of force as a function of need for
       internal political support are more mixed.^[128]^: 152–53  U.S.
       war-time presidential popularity surveys taken during the
       presidencies of several recent U.S. leaders have supported
       diversionary theory.^[129]

    Individual-level

   These theories suggest differences in people's personalities,
   decision-making, emotions, belief systems, and biases are important in
   determining whether conflicts get out of hand.^[128]^: 157  For
   instance, it has been proposed that conflict is modulated by bounded
   rationality and various cognitive biases,^[128]^: 157  such as prospect
   theory.^[130]

Ethics

   [220px-Morgen_nach_der_Schlacht967b.jpg] Morning after the Battle of
   Waterloo, by John Heaviside Clark, 1816

   The morality of war has been the subject of debate for thousands of
   years.^[131]

   The two principal aspects of ethics in war, according to the just war
   theory, are jus ad bellum and jus in bello.^[132]

   Jus ad bellum (right to war), dictates which unfriendly acts and
   circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another
   nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war:
   first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it
   must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit
   large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful
   intentions – namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil;
   fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success;
   fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought
   must be proportional to means being used.^[133]^[134]
   [220px-RIAN_archive_324_In_besieged_Leningrad.jpg] In besieged
   Leningrad. "Hitler ordered that Moscow and Leningrad were to be razed
   to the ground; their inhabitants were to be annihilated or driven out
   by starvation. These intentions were part of the 'General Plan East'."
   – The Oxford Companion to World War II.^[135]

   Jus in bello (right in war), is the set of ethical rules when
   conducting war. The two main principles are proportionality and
   discrimination. Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and
   morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice
   suffered.^[136] The principle of discrimination determines who are the
   legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation
   between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants,
   who it is not.^[136] Failure to follow these rules can result in the
   loss of legitimacy for the just-war-belligerent.^[137]

   The just war theory was foundational in the creation of the United
   Nations and in international law's regulations on legitimate war.^[131]

   Lewis Coser, an American conflict theorist and sociologist, argued
   conflict provides a function and a process whereby a succession of new
   equilibriums are created. Thus, the struggle of opposing forces, rather
   than being disruptive, may be a means of balancing and maintaining a
   social structure or society.^[138]

Limiting and stopping

   [220px-Washington_March15_2003-02.jpg] Anti-war rally in Washington,
   D.C., 15 March 2003

   Main article: Anti-war movement

   Religious groups have long formally opposed or sought to limit war as
   in the Second Vatican Council document Gaudiem et Spes: "Any act of war
   aimed indiscriminately at the destruction of entire cities of extensive
   areas along with their population is a crime against God and man
   himself. It merits unequivocal and unhesitating condemnation."^[139]

   Anti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th
   century, including, most prominently, World War I, World War II, and
   the Vietnam War. In the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements
   occurred in response to the United States invasion of Afghanistan and
   Iraq. Protests opposing the War in Afghanistan occurred in Europe,
   Asia, and the United States.

Pauses

   During a war, brief pauses of violence may be called for, and further
   agreed to – ceasefire, temporary cessation, humanitarian pauses and
   corridors, days of tranquility, de-confliction arrangements.^[140]
   There are a number of disadvantages, obstacles and hesitations against
   implementing such pauses such as a humanitarian corridor.^[141]^[142]
   Pauses in conflict can also be ill-advised, for reasons such as "delay
   of defeat" and the "weakening of credibility".^[143] Natural causes for
   a pause may include events such as the 2019 coronavirus
   pandemic.^[144]^[145]

Notes

    1. ^ The term "armed conflict" is used instead of, or in addition to,
       the term "war" with the former being more general in scope. The
       International Committee of the Red Cross differentiates between
       international and non-international armed conflict in their
       definition, "International armed conflicts exist whenever there is
       resort to armed force between two or more States....
       Non-international armed conflicts are protracted armed
       confrontations occurring between governmental armed forces and the
       forces of one or more armed groups, or between such groups arising
       on the territory of a State [party to the Geneva Conventions]. The
       armed confrontation must reach a minimum level of intensity and the
       parties involved in the conflict must show a minimum of
       organisation."^[1]
    2. ^ ^a ^b The argument is made from pages 314 to 332 of The Blank
       Slate.^[93] Relevant quotes include on p332 "The first step in
       understanding violence is to set aside our abhorrence of it long
       enough to examine why it can sometimes pay off in evolutionary
       terms.", "Natural selection is powered by competition, which means
       that the products of natural selection – survival machines, in
       Richard Dawkins metaphor – should, by default, do whatever helps
       them survive and reproduce.". On p323 "If an obstacle stands in the
       way of something an organism needs, it should neutralize the
       obstacle by disabling or eliminating it.", "Another human obstacle
       consists of men monopolozing women who could otherwise be taken as
       wives.", "The competition can be violent". On p324 "So people have
       invented, and perhaps evolved, an alternate defense: the advertised
       deterrence policy known as lex talionis, the law of retaliation,
       familiar from the biblical injunction "An eye for an eye, a tooth
       for a tooth." If you can credibly say to potential adversaries, "We
       won't attack first, but if we are attacked, we will survive and
       strike back," you removee Hobbes's first two incentives for
       quarrel, gain and mistrust.". On p326 "Also necessary for vengeance
       to work as a deterrent is that the willingness to pursue it be made
       public, because the whole point of deterrence is to give would-be
       attackers second thoughts beforehand. And this brings us to
       Hobbes's final reason for quarrel. Thirdly, glory – though a more
       accurate word would be "honor"."

   War is generally defined as violent conflict between states or nations.
   Nations go to war for a variety of reasons. It has been argued that a
   nation will go to war if the benefits of war are deemed to outweigh the
   disadvantages, and if there is a sense that there is not another
   mutually agreeable solution. More specifically, some have argued that
   wars are fought primarily for economic, religious, and political
   reasons. Others have claimed that most wars today are fought for
   ideological reasons.
   In the United States, the legal power to declare war is vested in
   Congress; however, the president is the commander-in-chief of the
   military, so he or she holds power to conduct a war once it has been
   declared. In many instances, the president has used military force
   without declaring war.
   Just War Theory
   In Western tradition, there is a sense that the reasons for war must be
   just. This idea dates back to ancient times, but is most clearly traced
   to the writings of St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas. They attempted
   to justify war, and reconcile it with the Christian belief that taking
   a human life is wrong.
   To Aquinas, a war must be just in both the reasons for going to war and
   how war is fought. Reasons for going to war—jus ad bellum—are just if
   (1) war is declared by an appropriate authority; (2) the war is waged
   for a just cause; and (3) the war is waged for just intentions. An
   appropriate authority is a proper, governing authority. A “just cause”
   may include self-defense or a response to injustice. “Just intentions”
   mean that it must not be fought for self-interest, but for justice or a
   common good. In addition, (4) there must be a reasonable chance of
   success; (5) the good that will be achieved must outweigh the bad; and
   (6) war must be a last resort.
   Once just reasons for going to war are satisfied, conduct in the
   war—jus in bello—must be just as well. Just conduct in a war means that
   it must be specific and proportional. That is, noncombatants and
   civilians must not be deliberately targeted. Further, only such force
   as is necessary must be used, and harms must be proportionate to the
   goal sought.
   Law of War
   Some of the just war theories have been adopted as parts of
   international agreements and incorporated into the law of war (i.e.,
   international law) that regulates the resort to armed force, the
   conduct of hostilities, and the protection of war victims.
   The Geneva Conventions, for example, are a series of international
   treaties that are designed to protect noncombatants, civilians, and
   prisoners of war. The treaties were negotiated in Geneva, Switzerland,
   between 1864 and 1977. The First and Second Geneva Conventions apply to
   sick and wounded soldiers and sailors. They contain provisions related
   to protecting the wounded and sick, as well as medical personnel and
   transports. The Third Geneva Convention applies to prisoners of war,
   and the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to people in occupied
   territories. The Third Convention requires humane treatment of
   prisoners, including adequate food and water. The Fourth Convention
   includes provisions that forbid torture and the taking of hostages, as
   well as provisions related to medical care and hospitals.

   war, in the popular sense, a conflict between political groups
   involving hostilities of considerable duration and magnitude. In the
   usage of social science, certain qualifications are added. Sociologists
   usually apply the term to such conflicts only if they are initiated and
   conducted in accordance with socially recognized forms. They treat war
   as an institution recognized in custom or in law. Military writers
   usually confine the term to hostilities in which the contending groups
   are sufficiently equal in power to render the outcome uncertain for a
   time. Armed conflicts of powerful states with isolated and powerless
   peoples are usually called pacifications, military expeditions, or
   explorations; with small states, they are called interventions or
   reprisals; and with internal groups, rebellions or insurrections. Such
   incidents, if the resistance is sufficiently strong or protracted, may
   achieve a magnitude that entitles them to the name “war.”

   In all ages war has been an important topic of analysis. In the latter
   part of the 20th century, in the aftermath of two World Wars and in the
   shadow of nuclear, biological, and chemical holocaust, more was written
   on the subject than ever before. Endeavours to understand the nature of
   war, to formulate some theory of its causes, conduct, and prevention,
   are of great importance, for theory shapes human expectations and
   determines human behaviour. The various schools of theorists are
   generally aware of the profound influence they can exercise upon life,
   and their writings usually include a strong normative element, for,
   when accepted by politicians, their ideas can assume the
   characteristics of self-fulfilling prophecies.

   The analysis of war may be divided into several categories.
   Philosophical, political, economic, technological, legal, sociological,
   and psychological approaches are frequently distinguished. These
   distinctions indicate the varying focuses of interest and the different
   analytical categories employed by the theoretician, but most of the
   actual theories are mixed because war is an extremely complex social
   phenomenon that cannot be explained by any single factor or through any
   single approach.

Evolution of theories of war

   Reflecting changes in the international system, theories of war have
   passed through several phases in the course of the past three
   centuries. After the ending of the wars of religion, about the middle
   of the 17th century, wars were fought for the interests of individual
   sovereigns and were limited both in their objectives and in their
   scope. The art of maneuver became decisive, and analysis of war was
   couched accordingly in terms of strategies. The situation changed
   fundamentally with the outbreak of the French Revolution, which
   increased the size of forces from small professional to large conscript
   armies and broadened the objectives of war to the ideals of the
   revolution, ideals that appealed to the masses who were subject to
   conscription. In the relative order of post-Napoleonic Europe, the
   mainstream of theory returned to the idea of war as a rational, limited
   instrument of national policy. This approach was best articulated by
   the Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz in his famous
   classic On War (1832–37).

   World War I, which was “total” in character because it resulted in the
   mobilization of entire populations and economies for a prolonged period
   of time, did not fit into the Clausewitzian pattern of limited
   conflict, and it led to a renewal of other theories. These no longer
   regarded war as a rational instrument of state policy. The theorists
   held that war, in its modern, total form, if still conceived as a
   national state instrument, should be undertaken only if the most vital
   interests of the state, touching upon its very survival, are concerned.
   Otherwise, warfare serves broad ideologies and not the more narrowly
   defined interests of a sovereign or a nation. Like the religious wars
   of the 17th century, war becomes part of “grand designs,” such as the
   rising of the proletariat in communist eschatology or the Nazi doctrine
   of a master race.

   Some theoreticians have gone even further, denying war any rational
   character whatsoever. To them war is a calamity and a social disaster,
   whether it is afflicted by one nation upon another or conceived of as
   afflicting humanity as a whole. The idea is not new—in the aftermath of
   the Napoleonic Wars it was articulated, for example, by Tolstoy in the
   concluding chapter of War and Peace (1865–69). In the second half of
   the 20th century it gained new currency in peace research, a
   contemporary form of theorizing that combines analysis of the origins
   of warfare with a strong normative element aiming at its prevention.
   Peace research concentrates on two areas: the analysis of the
   international system and the empirical study of the phenomenon of war.

   World War II and the subsequent evolution of weapons of mass
   destruction made the task of understanding the nature of war even more
   urgent. On the one hand, war had become an intractable social
   phenomenon, the elimination of which seemed to be an essential
   precondition for the survival of mankind. On the other hand, the use of
   war as an instrument of policy was calculated in an unprecedented
   manner by the nuclear superpowers, the United States and the Soviet
   Union. War also remained a stark but rational instrumentality in
   certain more limited conflicts, such as those between Israel and the
   Arab nations. Thinking about war, consequently, became increasingly
   more differentiated because it had to answer questions related to very
   different types of conflict.
   Carl von Clausewitz (BUTTON)

   Clausewitz cogently defines war as a rational instrument of foreign
   policy: “an act of violence intended to compel our opponent to fulfill
   our will.” Modern definitions of war, such as “armed conflict between
   political units,” generally disregard the narrow, legalistic
   definitions characteristic of the 19th century, which limited the
   concept to formally declared war between states. Such a definition
   includes civil wars but at the same time excludes such phenomena as
   insurrections, banditry, or piracy. Finally, war is generally
   understood to embrace only armed conflicts on a fairly large scale,
   usually excluding conflicts in which fewer than 50,000 combatants are
   involved.

   Nov 26, 2023 - ISW Press

   Russian forces conducted a series of Shahed drone strikes on Ukraine on
   the night of November 25-26. Ukrainian military officials reported that
   Russian forces launched nine Shahed-136/131 from Primorsko-Akhtarsk
   direction and that Ukrainian air defenses shot down eight drones.
   Ukrainian Joint Forces Commander Lieutenant General Serhiy Nayev, like
   other Ukrainian officials on November 25, continued to praise the
   actions of Ukrainian mobile fire groups in intercepting Russian drones.
   Nayev stated that mobile fire groups will receive foreign-made
   man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) in the near future.

   Nov 26, 2023 - ISW Press

   Neither Israel nor Hamas claimed violations of the humanitarian pause
   in the Gaza Strip as they completed the third swap of Hamas-held
   hostages for Israeli-held prisoners on November 26. Israel and Hamas
   confirmed that Hamas released 17 hostages held in the Gaza Strip in
   exchange for Israel releasing 39 Palestinian prisoners. The hostages
   included the first American whom Hamas has released since the war
   began. Hamas also released a Russian citizen whom they claimed that
   they released because of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s support for
   the Palestinian cause. Russia hosted Hamas leadership in Moscow on
   October 26. Hamas separately said on November 26 that it seeks to
   extend the pause after the four-day period ends on November 27. Israeli
   Army Radio reported that there are efforts to extend the pause by an
   additional four days in return for Hamas releasing 40 hostages. This
   report is consistent with previous reports saying that Israel and Hamas
   agreed to extend the pause for 24 hours for every 10 hostages released
   by Hamas.

   Russian forces launched the largest drone strike against Ukraine since
   the start of the full-scale invasion overnight on November 24 to 25
   using a new modification of the Iranian Shahed 131/136 drones.
   Ukrainian military officials reported that Russian forces launched 75
   Shahed drones that mainly targeted Kyiv City from the southeast
   (Primorsko-Akhtarsk) and northeast (Kursk Oblast) and that Ukrainian
   forces shot down 74 drones. Ukrainian military officials also reported
   that Ukrainian forces shot down a Russian Kh-59 cruise missile over
   Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and that air defenses activated in at least six
   regions, including Kyiv, Sumy, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhia, Mykolaiv,
   and Kirovohrad oblasts. Ukrainian Air Force officials stated that
   mobile fire groups enabled Ukrainian forces to shoot down a significant
   number of drones. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky observed that
   Russian forces launched the drone attack on the Ukrainian remembrance
   day of the 1932-1933 Holodomor man-made famine.

   Nov 25, 2023 - ISW Press

   Hamas released a second round of hostages after Hamas accused Israel of
   violating the humanitarian pause agreement and threatened to delay the
   hostages’ release.

   CTP-ISW did not record verifiable reports of kinetic activity inside
   the Gaza Strip or reports of attacks from the Gaza Strip into Israel.

   CTP-ISW recorded nine small arms clashes between Israeli forces and
   Palestinian fighters in the West Bank.

   Palestinian militias are trying to exert greater control over the
   Palestinian population in the West Bank to facilitate further militia
   operations against Israeli targets.

   Israeli and Lebanese Hezbollah (LH) media suggested that LH conducted
   2-3 attacks into northern Israel.

   Iranian-backed Iraqi factions are trying to exploit the Israel-Hamas
   war to erode US military and political influence in Iraq.

   Iran and its Axis of Resistance appear to be continuing to threaten
   Israeli-affiliated commercial shipping.

   The Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi
   militias—did not claim any attacks against US forces in Iraq or Syria.

   The Israel–Hamas four-day humanitarian pause went into effect on
   November 24. Israeli forces and Hamas have not claimed attacks in the
   Gaza Strip in accordance with the pause. Israel and Hamas agreed to a
   prisoner/hostage swap but characterized it with different levels of
   detail on November 22. The Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed
   on November 24 that 24 hostages were freed from the Gaza Strip,
   including 13 Israeli citizens, 10 Thai citizens, and one Filipino
   citizen. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on November 22
   that the deal allows Red Cross representatives to visit hostages in the
   Gaza Strip and deliver medicine. Qatar confirmed that Israel freed 39
   Palestinians from prison in return during the first stage of the swap.

   that occurred in October. Ukrainian Tavriisk Group of Forces Commander
   Brigadier General Oleksandr Tarnavskyi reported on November 23 that
   Russian forces launched a “third wave” of assaults as part of the
   Russia offensive operation in the Avdiivka direction, and Tavriisk
   Group of Forces Spokesperson Colonel Oleksandr Shtupun stated that this
   “third wave” began on November 22. Shtupun reported a 25 to 30 percent
   increase in Russian ground attacks near Avdiivka on November 22 and
   stated that Ukrainian forces repelled several Russian columns of
   roughly a dozen armored vehicles in total during assaults. The
   Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled at
   least 50 Russian assaults in the Avdiivka direction on November 23 and
   24. Russian sources claimed that Russian forces continued offensive
   operations on Avdiivka’s northern and southern flanks but did not
   characterize any Russian assaults as heavily mechanized.

   World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War or the
   Great War in historical contexts, was a global conflict from 1914 to
   1918. It was fought between two coalitions: the Allied Powers and the
   Central Powers. Fighting took place throughout Europe, the Middle East,
   Africa, the Pacific, and parts of Asia. One of the deadliest wars in
   history, it resulted in an estimated 9 million soldiers dead and 23
   million wounded, plus another 5 million civilian deaths from various
   causes. Millions more died as a result of genocide, and the war was a
   major factor in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.

   The first decade of the 20th century saw increasing diplomatic tension
   between the European great powers. This reached a breaking point on 28
   June 1914, when a Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip assassinated
   Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne.
   Austria-Hungary held Serbia responsible, and declared war on 28 July.
   Russia came to Serbia's defence, and by 4 August, Germany, France, and
   Britain were drawn into the war, with the Ottoman Empire joining in
   November of that same year.

   Germany's strategy in 1914 was to first defeat France, then transfer
   forces to the Russian front. However, this failed, and by the end of
   1914, the Western Front consisted of a continuous line of trenches
   stretching from the English Channel to Switzerland. The Eastern Front
   was more dynamic, but neither side could gain a decisive advantage,
   despite costly offensives. As the war expanded to more fronts,
   Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Italy and others joined in from 1915 onward.

   In early 1917, the United States entered the war on the side of the
   Allies, and later the same year, the Bolsheviks seized power in the
   Russian October Revolution, making peace with the Central Powers in
   early 1918. Germany launched an offensive in the west in March 1918,
   and despite initial success, it left the German Army exhausted and
   demoralised. A successful Allied counter-offensive later that year
   caused a collapse of the German frontline. By the end of 1918,
   Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary agreed to armistices
   with the Allies, leaving Germany isolated. Facing revolution at home
   and with his army on the verge of mutiny, Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated
   on 9 November.

   Fighting ended with the Armistice of 11 November 1918, while the
   subsequent Paris Peace Conference imposed various settlements on the
   defeated powers, notably the Treaty of Versailles. The dissolution of
   the Russian, German, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman Empires resulted in
   the creation of new independent states, including Poland, Finland,
   Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The inability to manage post-war
   instability contributed to the outbreak of World War II in September
   1939.

Names

   The term world war was first coined in September 1914 by German
   biologist and philosopher Ernst Haeckel. He claimed that "there is no
   doubt that the course and character of the feared 'European War' ...
   will become the first world war in the full sense of the word,"^[1] in
   The Indianapolis Star on 20 September 1914.

   The term First World War had been used by Lt-Col. Charles à Court
   Repington, as a title for his memoirs (published in 1920); he had noted
   his discussion on the matter with a Major Johnstone of Harvard
   University in his diary entry of 10 September 1918.^[2]^[3]

   Prior to World War II, the events of 1914–1918 were generally known as
   the Great War or simply the World War.^[4] In August 1914, the magazine
   The Independent wrote "This is the Great War. It names itself".^[5] In
   October 1914, the Canadian magazine Maclean's similarly wrote, "Some
   wars name themselves. This is the Great War."^[6] Contemporary
   Europeans also referred to it as "the war to end war" and it was also
   described as "the war to end all wars" due to their perception of its
   unparalleled scale, devastation, and loss of life.^[7]

  Political and military alliances

   For much of the 19th century, the major European powers maintained a
   tenuous balance of power among themselves, known as the Concert of
   Europe.^[8] After 1848, this was challenged by a variety of factors,
   including Britain's withdrawal into so-called splendid isolation, the
   decline of the Ottoman Empire, New Imperialism, and the rise of Prussia
   under Otto von Bismarck. The 1866 Austro-Prussian War established
   Prussian hegemony in German states, while victory in the 1870–1871
   Franco-Prussian War allowed Bismarck to consolidate the German states
   into a German Empire under Prussian leadership. Avenging the defeat of
   1871, or revanchism, and recovering the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine
   became the principal objects of French policy for the next forty
   years.^[9]

     Triple Entente

     Triple Alliance

   In order to isolate France and avoid a war on two fronts, Bismarck
   negotiated the League of the Three Emperors (German: Dreikaiserbund)
   between Austria-Hungary, Russia and Germany. After Russian victory in
   the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War, the League was dissolved due to
   Austrian concerns over Russian influence in the Balkans, an area they
   considered of vital strategic interest. Germany and Austria-Hungary
   then formed the 1879 Dual Alliance, which became the Triple Alliance
   when Italy joined in 1882.^[10] For Bismarck, the purpose of these
   agreements was to isolate France by ensuring the three Empires resolved
   any disputes between themselves; when this was threatened in 1880 by
   British and French attempts to negotiate directly with Russia, he
   reformed the League in 1881, which was renewed in 1883 and 1885. After
   the agreement lapsed in 1887, he replaced it with the Reinsurance
   Treaty, a secret agreement between Germany and Russia to remain neutral
   if either were attacked by France or Austria-Hungary.^[11]

   Bismarck viewed peace with Russia as the foundation of German foreign
   policy but after becoming Kaiser in 1890, Wilhelm II forced him to
   retire and was persuaded not to renew the Reinsurance Treaty by his new
   Chancellor, Leo von Caprivi.^[12] This provided France an opportunity
   to counteract the Triple Alliance by signing the Franco-Russian
   Alliance in 1894, followed by the 1904 Entente Cordiale with Britain.
   The Triple Entente was completed by the 1907 Anglo-Russian Convention.
   While these were not formal alliances, by settling long-standing
   colonial disputes in Africa and Asia, the notion of British entry into
   any future conflict involving France or Russia became a
   possibility.^[13] British and Russian support for France against
   Germany during the Agadir Crisis in 1911 reinforced their relationship
   and increased Anglo-German estrangement, deepening the divisions that
   would erupt in 1914.^[14]

  Arms race

   German industrial strength and production significantly increased after
   1871, driven by the creation of a unified Reich, French indemnity
   payments, and the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine. Backed by Wilhelm II,
   Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz sought to use this growth in economic power
   to build a Kaiserliche Marine, or Imperial German Navy, which could
   compete with the British Royal Navy for world naval supremacy.^[15] His
   thinking was influenced by US naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, who
   argued possession of a blue-water navy was vital for global power
   projection; Tirpitz had his books translated into German, while Wilhelm
   made them required reading for his advisors and senior military
   personnel.^[16]

   However, it was also an emotional decision, driven by Wilhelm's
   simultaneous admiration for the Royal Navy and desire to outdo and
   surpass it. Bismarck thought that the British would not interfere in
   Europe, so long as its maritime supremacy remained secure, but his
   dismissal in 1890 led to a change in policy and an Anglo-German naval
   arms race began.^[17] Despite the vast sums spent by Tirpitz, the
   launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1906 gave the British a technological
   advantage over their German rivals which they never lost.^[15]
   Ultimately, the race diverted huge resources into creating a German
   navy large enough to antagonise Britain, but not defeat it; in 1911,
   Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg acknowledged defeat, leading
   to the Rüstungswende or 'armaments turning point', when he switched
   expenditure from the navy to the army.^[18]

   nd%22.jpg] SMS Rheinland, a Nassau-class battleship, Germany's first
   response to the British Dreadnought

   This decision was not driven by a reduction in political tensions, but
   German concern over Russia's quick recovery from its defeat in the
   Russo-Japanese War and subsequent 1905 Russian Revolution that same
   year. Economic reforms backed by funding from the French led to a
   significant post-1908 expansion of railways and transportation
   infrastructure, particularly in its western border regions.^[19] Since
   Germany and Austria-Hungary relied on faster mobilisation to compensate
   for their numerical inferiority compared to Russia, the threat posed by
   the closing of this gap was more important than competing with the
   Royal Navy. After Germany expanded its standing army by 170,000 troops
   in 1913, France extended compulsory military service from two to three
   years; similar measures were taken by the Balkan powers and Italy,
   which led to increased expenditure by the Ottomans and Austria-Hungary.
   Absolute figures are hard to calculate due to differences in
   categorising expenditure, since they often omit civilian infrastructure
   projects like railways which also had logistical importance and
   military use. It is known, however, that from 1908 to 1913, military
   spending by the six major European powers increased by over 50% in real
   terms.^[20]

  Conflicts in the Balkans

   proclamation of the Austrian annexation in 1908

   The years before 1914 were marked by a series of crises in the Balkans
   as other powers sought to benefit from Ottoman decline. While
   Pan-Slavic and Orthodox Russia considered itself the protector of
   Serbia and other Slav states, they preferred the strategically vital
   Bosporus straits to be controlled by a weak Ottoman government, rather
   than an ambitious Slav power like Bulgaria. Since Russia had its own
   ambitions in northeastern Anatolia and their clients had over-lapping
   claims in the Balkans, balancing these divided Russian policy-makers
   and added to regional instability.^[21]

   Austrian statesmen viewed the Balkans as essential for the continued
   existence of their Empire, and saw Serbian expansion as a direct
   threat. The 1908–1909 Bosnian Crisis began when Austria annexed the
   former Ottoman territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which it had
   occupied since 1878. Timed to coincide with the Bulgarian Declaration
   of Independence from the Ottoman Empire, this unilateral action was
   denounced by the European powers, but accepted as there was no
   consensus on how to resolve the situation. Some historians see this as
   a significant escalation, ending any chance of Austria co-operating
   with Russia in the Balkans while also damaging diplomatic relations
   between Serbia and Italy, both of whom had their own expansionist
   ambitions in the region.^[22]

   Tensions increased after the 1911–1912 Italo-Turkish War demonstrated
   Ottoman weakness and led to the formation of the Balkan League, an
   alliance of Serbia, Bulgaria, Montenegro, and Greece.^[23] The League
   quickly overran most of the Ottomans' territory in the Balkans during
   the 1912–1913 First Balkan War, much to the surprise of outside
   observers.^[24] The Serbian capture of ports on the Adriatic resulted
   in partial Austrian mobilisation starting on 21 November 1912,
   including units along the Russian border in Galicia. In a meeting the
   next day, the Russian government decided not to mobilise in response,
   unwilling to precipitate a war for which they were not as of yet
   prepared to handle.^[25]

   The Great Powers sought to re-assert control through the 1913 Treaty of
   London, which created an independent Albania, while enlarging the
   territories of Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Greece. However,
   disputes between the victors sparked the 33-day Second Balkan War, when
   Bulgaria attacked Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913; it was defeated,
   losing most of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece, and Southern Dobruja to
   Romania.^[26] The result was that even countries which benefited from
   the Balkan Wars, such as Serbia and Greece, felt cheated of their
   "rightful gains", while for Austria it demonstrated the apparent
   indifference with which other powers viewed their concerns, including
   Germany.^[27] This complex mix of resentment, nationalism and
   insecurity helps explain why the pre-1914 Balkans became known as the
   "powder keg of Europe".^[28]

  Sarajevo assassination

   Main article: Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand

   [220px-Gavrilo_Princip_captured_in_Sarajevo_1914.jpg] Traditionally
   thought to show the arrest of Gavrilo Princip (right), this photo is
   now believed by historians to depict an innocent bystander, Ferdinand
   Behr^[29]^[30]

   On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive
   to Emperor Franz Joseph, visited Sarajevo, capital of the recently
   annexed provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Six assassins^[k] from the
   movement known as Young Bosnia, or Mlada Bosna, took up positions along
   the route taken by the Archduke's motorcade, with the intention of
   assassinating him. Supplied with arms by extremists within the Serbian
   Black Hand intelligence organisation, they hoped his death would free
   Bosnia from Austrian rule, although there was little agreement on what
   would replace it.^[32]

   Nedeljko Čabrinović threw a grenade at the Archduke's car and injured
   two of his aides, who were taken to hospital while the convoy carried
   on. The other assassins were also unsuccessful but an hour later, as
   Ferdinand was returning from visiting the injured officers, his car
   took a wrong turn into a street where Gavrilo Princip was standing. He
   stepped forward and fired two pistol shots, fatally wounding Ferdinand
   and his wife Sophie, who both died shortly thereafter.^[33] Although
   Emperor Franz Joseph was shocked by the incident, political and
   personal differences meant the two men were not close; allegedly, his
   first reported comment was "A higher power has re-established the order
   which I, alas, could not preserve".^[34]

   According to historian Zbyněk Zeman, his reaction was reflected more
   broadly in Vienna, where "the event almost failed to make any
   impression whatsoever. On 28 and 29 June, the crowds listened to music
   and drank wine, as if nothing had happened."^[35] Nevertheless, the
   impact of the murder of the heir to the throne was significant, and has
   been described by historian Christopher Clark as a "9/11 effect, a
   terrorist event charged with historic meaning, transforming the
   political chemistry in Vienna".^[36]

  Expansion of violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina

   Crowds on the streets in the aftermath of the anti-Serb riots in
   Sarajevo, 29 June 1914

   The Austro-Hungarian authorities encouraged the subsequent anti-Serb
   riots in Sarajevo, in which Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks killed two
   Bosnian Serbs and damaged numerous Serb-owned buildings.^[37]^[38]
   Violent actions against ethnic Serbs were also organised outside
   Sarajevo, in other cities in Austro-Hungarian-controlled Bosnia and
   Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia. Austro-Hungarian authorities in
   Bosnia and Herzegovina imprisoned and extradited approximately 5,500
   prominent Serbs, 700 to 2,200 of whom died in prison. A further 460
   Serbs were sentenced to death. A predominantly Bosniak special militia
   known as the Schutzkorps was established and carried out the
   persecution of Serbs.^[39]^[40]^[41]^[42]

  July Crisis

   Austro-Hungarian entry into World War I, and Russian entry into World
   War I

   The assassination initiated the July Crisis, a month of diplomatic
   manoeuvring between Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France and
   Britain. Believing Serbian intelligence helped organise Franz
   Ferdinand's murder, Austrian officials wanted to use the opportunity to
   end their interference in Bosnia and saw war as the best way of
   achieving this.^[43] However, the Foreign Ministry had no solid proof
   of Serbian involvement and a dossier used to make its case was riddled
   with errors.^[44] On 23 July, Austria delivered an ultimatum to Serbia,
   listing ten demands made intentionally unacceptable to provide an
   excuse for starting hostilities.^[45]
   [310px-Austria_Hungary_ethnic.svg.png] Ethno-linguistic map of
   Austria-Hungary, 1910. Bosnia-Herzegovina was annexed in 1908.

   Serbia ordered general mobilisation on 25 July, but accepted all the
   terms, except for those empowering Austrian representatives to suppress
   "subversive elements" inside Serbia, and take part in the investigation
   and trial of Serbians linked to the assassination.^[46]^[47] Claiming
   this amounted to rejection, Austria broke off diplomatic relations and
   ordered partial mobilisation the next day; on 28 July, they declared
   war on Serbia and began shelling Belgrade. Having initiated war
   preparations on 25 July, Russia now ordered general mobilisation in
   support of Serbia on 30th.^[48]

   Anxious to ensure backing from the SPD political opposition by
   presenting Russia as the aggressor, German Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg
   delayed commencement of war preparations until 31 July.^[49] That
   afternoon the Russian government were handed a note requiring them to
   "cease all war measures against Germany and Austria-Hungary" within 12
   hours.^[50] A further German demand for neutrality was refused by the
   French who ordered general mobilisation but delayed declaring war.^[51]
   The German General Staff had long assumed they faced a war on two
   fronts; the Schlieffen Plan envisaged using 80% of the army to defeat
   France in the west, then switch to Russia. Since this required them to
   move quickly, mobilisation orders were issued that afternoon.^[52]
   [220px-The_War_of_the_Nations_WW1_337.jpg] Cheering crowds in London
   and Paris on the day war was declared.

   At a meeting on 29 July, the British cabinet had narrowly decided its
   obligations to Belgium under the 1839 Treaty of London did not require
   it to oppose a German invasion with military force. However, this was
   largely driven by Prime Minister Asquith's desire to maintain unity; he
   and his senior Cabinet ministers were already committed to support
   France, the Royal Navy had been mobilised and public opinion was
   strongly in favour of intervention.^[53] On 31 July, Britain sent notes
   to Germany and France, asking them to respect Belgian neutrality;
   France pledged to do so, Germany did not reply.^[54]

   Once the German ultimatum to Russia expired on the morning of 1 August,
   the two countries were at war. Later the same day, Wilhelm was informed
   by his ambassador in London, Prince Lichnowsky, that Britain would
   remain neutral if France was not attacked, and might not intervene at
   all given the ongoing Home Rule Crisis in Ireland.^[55] Jubilant at
   this news, he ordered General Moltke, the German chief of staff, to
   "march the whole of the ... army to the East". This allegedly brought
   Moltke to the verge of a nervous breakdown, who protested that "it
   cannot be done. The deployment of millions cannot be improvised."^[56]
   Lichnowsky soon realised he was mistaken, although Wilhelm insisted on
   waiting for a telegram from his cousin George V; once received it
   confirmed there had been a misunderstanding, and he told Moltke, "Now
   do what you want."^[57]

   Aware of German plans to attack through Belgium, French
   Commander-in-Chief Joseph Joffre asked his government for permission to
   cross the border and pre-empt such a move. To avoid a violation of
   Belgian neutrality, he was told any advance could come only after a
   German invasion.^[58] On 2 August, Germany occupied Luxembourg and
   exchanged fire with French units; on 3 August, they declared war on
   France and demanded free passage across Belgium, which was refused.
   Early on the morning of 4 August, the Germans invaded and Albert I of
   Belgium called for assistance under the Treaty of London.^[59]^[60]
   Britain sent Germany an ultimatum demanding they withdraw from Belgium;
   when this expired at midnight without a response, the two empires were
   at war.^[61]

  Opening hostilities

    Confusion among the Central Powers

   The strategy of the Central Powers suffered from miscommunication.
   Germany had promised to support Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia,
   but interpretations of what this meant differed. Previously tested
   deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914, but those had never
   been tested in exercises. Austro-Hungarian leaders believed Germany
   would cover its northern flank against Russia.^[62]

    Serbian campaign

   Main article: Serbian campaign

   [220px-FirstSerbianArmedPlane1915.jpg] Serbian Army Blériot XI "Oluj",
   1915

   Beginning on 12 August, the Austrian and Serbs clashed at the battles
   of the Cer and Kolubara; over the next two weeks, Austrian attacks were
   repulsed with heavy losses, dashing their hopes of a swift victory and
   marking the first major Allied victories of the war. As a result,
   Austria had to keep sizeable forces on the Serbian front, weakening its
   efforts against Russia.^[63] Serbia's defeat of the 1914 invasion has
   been called one of the major upset victories of the twentieth
   century.^[64] In spring 1915, the campaign saw the first use of
   anti-aircraft warfare after an Austrian plane was shot down with
   ground-to-air fire, as well as the first medical evacuation by the
   Serbian army in autumn 1915.^[65]^[66]

    German offensive in Belgium and France

   Main article: Great Retreat

   [220px-German_soldiers_in_a_railroad_car_on_the_way_to_the_front_during

   German soldiers on the way to the front in 1914; at this stage, all
   sides expected the conflict to be a short one.

   Upon mobilisation in 1914, 80% of the German Army was located on the
   Western Front, with the remainder acting as a screening force in the
   East; officially titled Aufmarsch II West, it is better known as the
   Schlieffen Plan after its creator, Alfred von Schlieffen, head of the
   German General Staff from 1891 to 1906. Rather than a direct attack
   across their shared frontier, the German right wing would sweep through
   the Netherlands and Belgium, then swing south, encircling Paris and
   trapping the French army against the Swiss border. Schlieffen estimated
   this would take six weeks, after which the German army would transfer
   to the East and defeat the Russians.^[67]

   The plan was substantially modified by his successor, Helmuth von
   Moltke the Younger. Under Schlieffen, 85% of German forces in the west
   were assigned to the right wing, with the remainder holding along the
   frontier. By keeping his left wing deliberately weak, he hoped to lure
   the French into an offensive into the "lost provinces" of
   Alsace-Lorraine, which was in fact the strategy envisaged by their Plan
   XVII.^[67] However, Moltke grew concerned the French might push too
   hard on his left flank and as the German Army increased in size from
   1908 to 1914, he changed the allocation of forces between the two wings
   from 85:15 to 70:30.^[68] He also considered Dutch neutrality essential
   for German trade and cancelled the incursion into the Netherlands,
   which meant any delays in Belgium threatened the entire viability of
   the plan.^[69] Historian Richard Holmes argues these changes meant the
   right wing was not strong enough to achieve decisive success and thus
   led to unrealistic goals and timings.^[70]
   [220px-Georges_Scott%2C_A_la_ba%C3%AFonnette_%21.jpg] French bayonet
   charge during the Battle of the Frontiers; by the end of August, French
   casualties exceeded 260,000, including 75,000 dead.

   The initial German advance in the West was very successful and by the
   end of August the Allied left, which included the British Expeditionary
   Force (BEF), was in full retreat. At the same time, the French
   offensive in Alsace-Lorraine was a disastrous failure, with casualties
   exceeding 260,000, including 27,000 killed on 22 August during the
   Battle of the Frontiers.^[71] German planning provided broad strategic
   instructions, while allowing army commanders considerable freedom in
   carrying them out at the front; this worked well in 1866 and 1870 but
   in 1914, von Kluck used this freedom to disobey orders, opening a gap
   between the German armies as they closed on Paris.^[72]

   In 1911, the Russian Stavka had agreed with the French to attack
   Germany within fifteen days of mobilisation, ten days before the
   Germans had anticipated, although it meant the two Russian armies that
   entered East Prussia on 17 August did so without many of their support
   elements.^[73]

   By the end of 1914, German troops held strong defensive positions
   inside France, controlled the bulk of France's domestic coalfields and
   had inflicted 230,000 more casualties than it lost itself. However,
   communications problems and questionable command decisions cost Germany
   the chance of a decisive outcome, while it had failed to achieve the
   primary objective of avoiding a long, two-front war.^[74] As was
   apparent to a number of German leaders, this amounted to a strategic
   defeat; shortly after the Marne, Crown Prince Wilhelm told an American
   reporter; "We have lost the war. It will go on for a long time but lost
   it is already."^[75]

    Asia and the Pacific

   colonies around 1914

   On 30 August 1914, New Zealand occupied German Samoa, now the
   independent state of Samoa. On 11 September, the Australian Naval and
   Military Expeditionary Force landed on the island of New Britain, then
   part of German New Guinea. On 28 October, the German cruiser SMS Emden
   sank the Russian cruiser Zhemchug in the Battle of Penang. Japan
   declared war on Germany prior to seizing territories in the Pacific
   which later became the South Seas Mandate, as well as German Treaty
   ports on the Chinese Shandong peninsula at Tsingtao. After Vienna
   refused to withdraw its cruiser SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth from Tsingtao,
   Japan declared war on Austria-Hungary as well, and the ship was sunk at
   Tsingtao in November 1914.^[76] Within a few months, Allied forces had
   seized all German territories in the Pacific, leaving only isolated
   commerce raiders and a few holdouts in New Guinea.^[77]^[78]

    African campaigns

   Main article: African theatre of World War I

   Some of the first clashes of the war involved British, French, and
   German colonial forces in Africa. On 6–7 August, French and British
   troops invaded the German protectorate of Togoland and Kamerun. On 10
   August, German forces in South-West Africa attacked South Africa;
   sporadic and fierce fighting continued for the rest of the war. The
   German colonial forces in German East Africa, led by Colonel Paul von
   Lettow-Vorbeck, fought a guerrilla warfare campaign during World War I
   and only surrendered two weeks after the armistice took effect in
   Europe.^[79]

    Indian support for the Allies

   troops were withdrawn in December 1915, and served in the Mesopotamian
   campaign.

   Prior to the war, Germany had attempted to use Indian nationalism and
   pan-Islamism to its advantage, a policy continued post-1914 by
   instigating uprisings in India, while the Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition
   urged Afghanistan to join the war on the side of Central Powers.
   However, contrary to British fears of a revolt in India, the outbreak
   of the war saw a reduction in nationalist activity.^[80]^[81] This was
   largely because leaders from the Indian National Congress and other
   groups believed support for the British war effort would hasten Indian
   Home Rule, a promise allegedly made explicit in 1917 by Edwin Montagu,
   then Secretary of State for India.^[82]

   In 1914, the British Indian Army was larger than the British Army
   itself, and between 1914 and 1918 an estimated 1.3 million Indian
   soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East,
   while the Government of India and their princely allies supplied large
   quantities of food, money, and ammunition. In all, 140,000 soldiers
   served on the Western Front and nearly 700,000 in the Middle East, with
   47,746 killed and 65,126 wounded.^[83]

   The suffering engendered by the war, as well as the failure of the
   British government to grant self-government to India after the end of
   hostilities, bred disillusionment and resulted in the campaign for full
   independence led by Mahatma Gandhi.^[84]

   Pre-war military tactics that emphasised open warfare and the
   individual rifleman proved obsolete when confronted with conditions
   prevailing in 1914. Technological advances allowed the creation of
   strong defensive systems largely impervious to massed infantry
   advances, such as barbed wire, machine guns and above all far more
   powerful artillery, which dominated the battlefield and made crossing
   open ground extremely difficult.^[85] Both sides struggled to develop
   tactics for breaching entrenched positions without suffering heavy
   casualties. In time, however, technology enabled the production of new
   offensive weapons, such as gas warfare and the tank.^[86]

   After the First Battle of the Marne in September 1914, Allied and
   German forces unsuccessfully tried to outflank each other, a series of
   manoeuvres later known as the "Race to the Sea". By the end of 1914,
   the opposing forces confronted each other along an uninterrupted line
   of entrenched positions from the Channel to the Swiss border.^[87]
   Since the Germans were normally able to choose where to stand, they
   generally held the high ground, while their trenches tended to be
   better built; those constructed by the French and English were
   initially considered "temporary", only needed until an offensive would
   smash the German defences.^[88] Both sides tried to break the stalemate
   using scientific and technological advances. On 22 April 1915, at the
   Second Battle of Ypres, the Germans (violating the Hague Convention)
   used chlorine gas for the first time on the Western Front. Several
   types of gas soon became widely used by both sides, and though it never
   proved a decisive, battle-winning weapon, it became one of the
   most-feared and best-remembered horrors of the war.^[89]^[90]

    Continuation of trench warfare

   [220px-The_Battle_of_the_Somme%2C_July-november_1916_Q4218.jpg] German
   casualties at the Somme, 1916

   In February 1916 the Germans attacked French defensive positions at the
   Battle of Verdun, lasting until December 1916. The Germans made initial
   gains, before French counter-attacks returned matters to near their
   starting point. Casualties were greater for the French, but the Germans
   bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000^[91] to 975,000^[92]
   casualties suffered between the two combatants. Verdun became a symbol
   of French determination and self-sacrifice.^[93]

   The Battle of the Somme was an Anglo-French offensive of July to
   November 1916. The opening day on 1 July 1916 was the bloodiest single
   day in the history of the British Army, which suffered 57,470
   casualties, including 19,240 dead. As a whole, the Somme offensive led
   to an estimated 420,000 British casualties, along with 200,000 French
   and 500,000 German.^[94] Gun fire was not the only factor taking lives;
   the diseases that emerged in the trenches were a major killer on both
   sides. The living conditions made it so that countless diseases and
   infections occurred, such as trench foot, shell shock, blindness/burns
   from mustard gas, lice, trench fever, "cooties" (body lice) and the
   'Spanish flu'.^[citation needed]

  Naval war

   Main article: Naval warfare of World War I

   [220px-Hochseeflotte_2.jpg] Battleships of the Hochseeflotte, 1917

   At the start of the war, German cruisers were scattered across the
   globe, some of which were subsequently used to attack Allied merchant
   shipping. The British Royal Navy systematically hunted them down,
   though not without some embarrassment from its inability to protect
   Allied shipping. For example, the light cruiser SMS Emden, which was
   part of the German East Asia Squadron stationed at Qingdao, seized or
   sank 15 merchantmen, as well as a Russian cruiser and a French
   destroyer. Most of the squadron was returning to Germany when it sank
   two British armoured cruisers at the Battle of Coronel in November
   1914, before being virtually destroyed at the Battle of the Falkland
   Islands in December. The SMS Dresden escaped with a few auxiliaries,
   but after the Battle of Más a Tierra, these too had either been
   destroyed or interned.^[95]

   Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade
   of Germany. The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military
   and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated accepted
   international law codified by several international agreements of the
   past two centuries.^[96] Britain mined international waters to prevent
   any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to
   even neutral ships.^[97] Since there was limited response to this
   tactic of the British, Germany expected a similar response to its
   unrestricted submarine warfare.^[98]

   The Battle of Jutland (German: Skagerrakschlacht, or "Battle of the
   Skagerrak") in May/June 1916 developed into the largest naval battle of
   the war. It was the only full-scale clash of battleships during the
   war, and one of the largest in history. The Kaiserliche Marine's High
   Seas Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, fought the Royal
   Navy's Grand Fleet, led by Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. The engagement
   was a stand off, as the Germans were outmanoeuvred by the larger
   British fleet, but managed to escape and inflicted more damage to the
   British fleet than they received. Strategically, however, the British
   asserted their control of the sea, and the bulk of the German surface
   fleet remained confined to port for the duration of the war.^[99]
   [220px-NationaalArchief_uboat155London.jpg] U-155 exhibited near Tower
   Bridge in London, after the 1918 Armistice

   German U-boats attempted to cut the supply lines between North America
   and Britain.^[100] The nature of submarine warfare meant that attacks
   often came without warning, giving the crews of the merchant ships
   little hope of survival.^[100]^[101] The United States launched a
   protest, and Germany changed its rules of engagement. After the sinking
   of the passenger ship RMS Lusitania in 1915, Germany promised not to
   target passenger liners, while Britain armed its merchant ships,
   placing them beyond the protection of the "cruiser rules", which
   demanded warning and movement of crews to "a place of safety" (a
   standard that lifeboats did not meet).^[102] Finally, in early 1917,
   Germany adopted a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, realising
   the Americans would eventually enter the war.^[100]^[103] Germany
   sought to strangle Allied sea lanes before the United States could
   transport a large army overseas, but after initial successes eventually
   failed to do so.^[100]

   The U-boat threat lessened in 1917, when merchant ships began
   travelling in convoys, escorted by destroyers. This tactic made it
   difficult for U-boats to find targets, which significantly lessened
   losses; after the hydrophone and depth charges were introduced,
   accompanying destroyers could attack a submerged submarine with some
   hope of success. Convoys slowed the flow of supplies since ships had to
   wait as convoys were assembled. The solution to the delays was an
   extensive program of building new freighters. Troopships were too fast
   for the submarines and did not travel the North Atlantic in
   convoys.^[104] The U-boats had sunk more than 5,000 Allied ships, at a
   cost of 199 submarines.^[105]

   World War I also saw the first use of aircraft carriers in combat, with
   HMS Furious launching Sopwith Camels in a successful raid against the
   Zeppelin hangars at Tondern in July 1918, as well as blimps for
   antisubmarine patrol.^[106]

   Faced with Russia in the east, Austria-Hungary could spare only
   one-third of its army to attack Serbia. After suffering heavy losses,
   the Austrians briefly occupied the Serbian capital, Belgrade. A Serbian
   counter-attack in the Battle of Kolubara succeeded in driving them from
   the country by the end of 1914. For the first ten months of 1915,
   Austria-Hungary used most of its military reserves to fight Italy.
   German and Austro-Hungarian diplomats, however, scored a coup by
   persuading Bulgaria to join the attack on Serbia.^[107] The
   Austro-Hungarian provinces of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia provided
   troops for Austria-Hungary in the fight with Serbia, Russia and Italy.
   Montenegro allied itself with Serbia.^[108]

   Bulgaria declared war on Serbia on 14 October 1915 and joined in the
   attack by the Austro-Hungarian army under Mackensen's army of 250,000
   that was already underway. Serbia was conquered in a little more than a
   month, as the Central Powers, now including Bulgaria, sent in 600,000
   troops total. The Serbian army, fighting on two fronts and facing
   certain defeat, retreated into northern Albania. The Serbs suffered
   defeat in the Battle of Kosovo. Montenegro covered the Serbian retreat
   towards the Adriatic coast in the Battle of Mojkovac in 6–7 January
   1916, but ultimately the Austrians also conquered Montenegro. The
   surviving Serbian soldiers were evacuated by ship to Greece.^[109]
   After conquest, Serbia was divided between Austro-Hungary and
   Bulgaria.^[110]

   In late 1915, a Franco-British force landed at Salonica in Greece to
   offer assistance and to pressure its government to declare war against
   the Central Powers. However, the pro-German King Constantine I
   dismissed the pro-Allied government of Eleftherios Venizelos before the
   Allied expeditionary force arrived.^[111]

   The Macedonian front was initially mostly static. French and Serbian
   forces retook limited areas of Macedonia by recapturing Bitola on 19
   November 1916 following the costly Monastir offensive, which brought
   stabilisation of the front.^[112]
   [220px-Austrians_executing_Serbs_1917.JPG] Austro-Hungarian troops
   executing captured Serbians, 1917. Serbia lost about 850,000 people
   during the war, a quarter of its pre-war population.^[113]

   Serbian and French troops finally made a breakthrough in September 1918
   in the Vardar offensive, after most of the German and Austro-Hungarian
   troops had been withdrawn. The Bulgarians were defeated at the Battle
   of Dobro Pole, and by 25 September British and French troops had
   crossed the border into Bulgaria proper as the Bulgarian army
   collapsed. Bulgaria capitulated four days later, on 29 September
   1918.^[114] The German high command responded by despatching troops to
   hold the line, but these forces were far too weak to re-establish a
   front.^[115]

   The disappearance of the Macedonian front meant that the road to
   Budapest and Vienna was now opened to Allied forces. Hindenburg and
   Ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now
   shifted decidedly against the Central Powers and, a day after the
   Bulgarian collapse, insisted on an immediate peace settlement.^[116]

   Gallipoli Campaign

   The Ottomans threatened Russia's Caucasian territories and Britain's
   communications with India via the Suez Canal. As the conflict
   progressed, the Ottoman Empire took advantage of the European powers'
   preoccupation with the war and conducted large-scale ethnic cleansing
   of the indigenous Armenian, Greek, and Assyrian Christian populations,
   known as the Armenian genocide, Greek genocide, and Sayfo
   respectively.^[117]^[118]^[119]

   The British and French opened overseas fronts with the Gallipoli (1915)
   and Mesopotamian campaigns (1914). In Gallipoli, the Ottoman Empire
   successfully repelled the British, French, and Australian and New
   Zealand Army Corps (ANZACs). In Mesopotamia, by contrast, after the
   defeat of the British defenders in the siege of Kut by the Ottomans
   (1915–16), British Imperial forces reorganised and captured Baghdad in
   March 1917. The British were aided in Mesopotamia by local Arab and
   Assyrian fighters, while the Ottomans employed local Kurdish and
   Turcoman tribes.^[120]

   Further to the west, the Suez Canal was defended from Ottoman attacks
   in 1915 and 1916; in August, a German and Ottoman force was defeated at
   the Battle of Romani by the ANZAC Mounted Division and the 52nd
   (Lowland) Infantry Division. Following this victory, an Egyptian
   Expeditionary Force advanced across the Sinai Peninsula, pushing
   Ottoman forces back in the Battle of Magdhaba in December and the
   Battle of Rafa on the border between the Egyptian Sinai and Ottoman
   Palestine in January 1917.^[121]
   [220px-Sarikam.jpg] Russian forest trench at the Battle of Sarikamish,

   Russian armies generally had success in the Caucasus campaign. Enver
   Pasha, supreme commander of the Ottoman armed forces, was ambitious and
   dreamed of re-conquering central Asia and areas that had been lost to
   Russia previously. He was, however, a poor commander.^[122] He launched
   an offensive against the Russians in the Caucasus in December 1914 with
   100,000 troops, insisting on a frontal attack against mountainous
   Russian positions in winter. He lost 86% of his force at the Battle of
   Sarikamish.^[123]

   The Ottoman Empire, with German support, invaded Persia (modern Iran)
   in December 1914 in an effort to cut off British and Russian access to
   petroleum reservoirs around Baku near the Caspian Sea.^[124] Persia,
   ostensibly neutral, had long been under the spheres of British and
   Russian influence. The Ottomans and Germans were aided by Kurdish and
   Azeri forces, together with a large number of major Iranian tribes,
   such as the Qashqai, Tangistanis, Lurs, and Khamseh, while the Russians
   and British had the support of Armenian and Assyrian forces. The
   Persian campaign was to last until 1918 and end in failure for the
   Ottomans and their allies. However, the Russian withdrawal from the war
   in 1917 led to Armenian and Assyrian forces, who had hitherto inflicted
   a series of defeats upon the forces of the Ottomans and their allies,
   being cut off from supply lines, outnumbered, outgunned and isolated,
   forcing them to fight and flee towards British lines in northern
   Mesopotamia.^[125]

   General Yudenich, the Russian commander from 1915 to 1916, drove the
   Turks out of most of the southern Caucasus with a string of
   victories.^[123]

   The Arab Revolt, instigated by the Arab bureau of the British Foreign
   Office, started June 1916 with the Battle of Mecca, led by Sharif
   Hussein of Mecca, and ended with the Ottoman surrender of Damascus.
   Fakhri Pasha, the Ottoman commander of Medina, resisted for more than
   two and half years during the siege of Medina before surrendering in
   January 1919.^[126]

   The Senussi tribe, along the border of Italian Libya and British Egypt,
   incited and armed by the Turks, waged a small-scale guerrilla war
   against Allied troops. The British were forced to dispatch 12,000
   troops to oppose them in the Senussi campaign. Their rebellion was
   finally crushed in mid-1916.^[127]

   Total Allied casualties on the Ottoman fronts amounted 650,000 men.
   Total Ottoman casualties were 725,000, with 325,000 dead and 400,000
   wounded.^[128]

   [220px-Italian_Front_1915-1917.jpg] Isonzo Offensives 1915–1917

   Although Italy joined the Triple Alliance in 1882, a treaty with its
   traditional Austrian enemy was so controversial that subsequent
   governments denied its existence and the terms were only made public in
   1915.^[129] This arose from nationalist designs on Austro-Hungarian
   territory in Trentino, the Austrian Littoral, Rijeka and Dalmatia,
   which were considered vital to secure the borders established in
   1866.^[130] In 1902, Rome secretly agreed with France to remain neutral
   if the latter was attacked by Germany, effectively nullifying its role
   in the Triple Alliance.^[131]

   When the war began in 1914, Italy argued the Triple Alliance was
   defensive in nature and it was not obliged to support an Austrian
   attack on Serbia. Opposition to joining the Central Powers increased
   when Turkey became a member in September, since in 1911 Italy had
   occupied Ottoman possessions in Libya and the Dodecanese islands.^[132]
   To secure Italian neutrality, the Central Powers offered them the
   French protectorate of Tunisia, while in return for an immediate entry
   into the war, the Allies agreed to their demands for Austrian territory
   and sovereignty over the Dodecanese.^[133] Although they remained
   secret, these provisions were incorporated into the April 1915 Treaty
   of London; Italy joined the Triple Entente and on 23 May declared war
   on Austria-Hungary,^[134] followed by Germany fifteen months later.

   f_first_world_war.jpg] Austro-Hungarian trench at 3,850 metres in the
   Ortler Alps, one of the most challenging fronts of the war

   The pre-1914 Italian army was the weakest in Europe, short of officers,
   trained men, adequate transport and modern weapons; by April 1915, some
   of these deficiencies had been remedied but it was still unprepared for
   the major offensive required by the Treaty of London.^[135] The
   advantage of superior numbers was offset by the difficult terrain; much
   of the fighting took place at altitudes of over 3000 metres in the Alps
   and Dolomites, where trench lines had to be cut through rock and ice
   and keeping troops supplied was a major challenge. These issues were
   exacerbated by unimaginative strategies and tactics.^[136] Between 1915
   and 1917, the Italian commander, Luigi Cadorna, undertook a series of
   frontal assaults along the Isonzo which made little progress and cost
   many lives; by the end of the war, total Italian combat deaths totalled
   around 548,000.^[137]

   In the spring of 1916, the Austro-Hungarians counterattacked in Asiago
   in the Strafexpedition, but made little progress and were pushed by the
   Italians back to the Tyrol.^[138] Although an Italian corps occupied
   southern Albania in May 1916, their main focus was the Isonzo front
   which after the capture of Gorizia in August 1916 remained static until
   October 1917. After a combined Austro-German force won a major victory
   at Caporetto, Cadorna was replaced by Armando Diaz who retreated more
   than 100 kilometres (62 mi) before holding positions along the Piave
   River.^[139] A second Austrian offensive was repulsed in June 1918 and
   by October it was clear the Central Powers had lost the war. On 24
   October, Diaz launched the Battle of Vittorio Veneto and initially met
   stubborn resistance, ^[140] but with Austria-Hungary collapsing,
   Hungarian divisions in Italy now demanded they be sent home.^[141] When
   this was granted, many others followed and the Imperial army
   disintegrated, the Italians taking over 300,000 prisoners.^[142] On
   3 November, the Armistice of Villa Giusti ended hostilities between
   Austria-Hungary and Italy which occupied Trieste and areas along the
   Adriatic Sea awarded to it in 1915.^[143]

   Romania key locations 1916–1918 (note; using 2022 borders)

   Despite secretly agreeing to support the Triple Alliance in 1883,
   Romania increasingly found itself at odds with the Central Powers over
   their support for Bulgaria in the 1912 to 1913 Balkan Wars and the
   status of ethnic Romanian communities in Hungarian-controlled
   Transylvania,^[144] which comprised an estimated 2.8 million of the 5.0
   million population.^[145] With the ruling elite split into pro-German
   and pro-Entente factions, Romania remained neutral in 1914, arguing
   like Italy that because Austria-Hungary had declared war on Serbia, it
   was under no obligation to join them.^[146] They maintained this
   position for the next two years, while allowing Germany and Austria to
   transport military supplies and advisors across Romanian
   territory.^[147]

   In September 1914, Russia had acknowledged Romanian rights to
   Austro-Hungarian territories including Transylvania and Banat, whose
   acquisition had widespread popular support, ^[145] and Russian success
   against Austria led Romania to join the Entente in the August 1916
   Treaty of Bucharest.^[147] Under the strategic plan known as Hypothesis
   Z, the Romanian army planned an offensive into Transylvania, while
   defending Southern Dobruja and Giurgiu against a possible Bulgarian
   counterattack.^[148] On 27 August 1916, they attacked Transylvania and
   occupied substantial parts of the province before being driven back by
   the recently formed German 9th Army, led by former Chief of Staff
   Falkenhayn.^[149] A combined German-Bulgarian-Turkish offensive
   captured Dobruja and Giurgiu, although the bulk of the Romanian army
   managed to escape encirclement and retreated to Bucharest, which
   surrendered to the Central Powers on 6 December 1916.^[150]

   On 7 May 1918 Romania signed the Treaty of Bucharest with the Central
   Powers, which recognised Romanian sovereignty over Bessarabia in return
   for ceding control of passes in the Carpathian Mountains to
   Austria-Hungary and granting oil concessions to Germany.^[151] Romania
   re-entered the war on 10 November 1918 on the side of the Allies and
   the Treaty of Bucharest was formally annulled by the Armistice of 11
   November 1918.^[152]^[l]

  Eastern Front

    Initial actions

   [220px-Mikolaj_II_w_Twierdzy_Przemysl.jpg] Emperor Nicholas II and
   Grand Duke Nikolaevich following the Russian capture of Przemyśl, the
   longest siege of the war.

   As previously agreed with France, Russian plans at the start of the war
   were to simultaneously advance into Austrian Galicia and East Prussia
   as soon as possible. Although their attack on Galicia was largely
   successful, and the invasions achieved their aim of forcing Germany to
   divert troops from the Western Front, the speed of mobilisation meant
   they did so without much of their heavy equipment and support
   functions. These weaknesses contributed to Russian defeats at
   Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes in August and September 1914, forcing
   them to withdraw from East Prussia with heavy losses.^[154]^[155] By
   spring 1915, they had also retreated from Galicia, and the May 1915
   Gorlice–Tarnów offensive then allowed the Central Powers to invade
   Russian-occupied Poland.^[156]

   Despite the successful June 1916 Brusilov offensive against the
   Austrians in eastern Galicia,^[157] shortages of supplies, heavy losses
   and command failures prevented the Russians from fully exploiting their
   victory. However, it was one of the most significant and impactful
   offensives of the war, diverting German resources from Verdun,
   relieving Austro-Hungarian pressure on the Italians, and convincing
   Romania to enter the war on the side of the Allies on 27 August. It
   also fatally weakened both the Austrian and Russian armies, whose
   offensive capabilities were badly affected by their losses and
   increased the disillusionment with the war that ultimately led to the
   Russian revolutions.^[158]

   Meanwhile, unrest grew in Russia as the Tsar remained at the front,
   with the home front controlled by Empress Alexandra. Her increasingly
   incompetent rule and food shortages in urban areas led to widespread
   protests and the murder of her favourite, Grigori Rasputin, at the end
   of 1916.^[159]

  Central Powers peace overtures

   [220px-River_Crossing_NGM-v31-p338.jpg] "They shall not pass", a phrase
   typically associated with the defence of Verdun

   On 12 December 1916, after ten brutal months of the Battle of Verdun
   and a successful offensive against Romania, Germany attempted to
   negotiate a peace with the Allies.^[160] However, this attempt was
   rejected out of hand as a "duplicitous war ruse".^[160]

   Soon after, US president Woodrow Wilson attempted to intervene as a
   peacemaker, asking in a note for both sides to state their demands and
   start negotiations. Lloyd George's War Cabinet considered the German
   offer to be a ploy to create divisions amongst the Allies. After
   initial outrage and much deliberation, they took Wilson's note as a
   separate effort, signalling that the United States was on the verge of
   entering the war against Germany following the "submarine outrages".
   While the Allies debated a response to Wilson's offer, the Germans
   chose to rebuff it in favour of "a direct exchange of views". Learning
   of the German response, the Allied governments were free to make clear
   demands in their response of 14 January. They sought restoration of
   damages, the evacuation of occupied territories, reparations for
   France, Russia and Romania, and a recognition of the principle of
   nationalities.^[161] This included the liberation of Italians, Slavs,
   Romanians, Czecho-Slovaks, and the creation of a "free and united
   Poland".^[161] On the question of security, the Allies sought
   guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars, complete with
   sanctions, as a condition of any peace settlement.^[162] The
   negotiations failed and the Entente powers rejected the German offer on
   the grounds that Germany had not put forward any specific
   proposals.^[citation needed]

    Russian Revolution and withdrawal

   Main articles: Russian Revolution, February Revolution, and October
   Revolution

   By the end of 1916, Russian casualties totalled nearly five million
   killed, wounded or captured, with major urban areas affected by food
   shortages and high prices. In March 1917, Tsar Nicholas ordered the
   military to forcibly suppress a wave of strikes in Petrograd but the
   troops refused to fire on the crowds.^[163] Revolutionaries set up the
   Petrograd Soviet and fearing a left-wing takeover, the State Duma
   forced Nicholas to abdicate and established the Russian Provisional
   Government, which confirmed Russia's willingness to continue the war.
   However, the Petrograd Soviet refused to disband, creating competing
   power centres and caused confusion and chaos, with frontline soldiers
   becoming increasingly demoralised and unwilling to fight on.^[164]

   Following the Tsar's abdication, Vladimir Lenin—with the help of the
   German government—was ushered by train from Switzerland into Russia on
   16 April 1917. Discontent and the weaknesses of the Provisional
   Government led to a rise in the popularity of the Bolshevik Party, led
   by Lenin, which demanded an immediate end to the war. The Revolution of
   November was followed in December by an armistice and negotiations with
   Germany. At first, the Bolsheviks refused the German terms, but when
   German troops began marching across Ukraine unopposed, the new
   government acceded to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on 3 March 1918. The
   treaty ceded vast territories, including Finland, Estonia, Latvia,
   Lithuania, parts of Poland and Ukraine to the Central Powers.^[165]

   With the Russian Empire out of the war, Romania found itself alone on
   the Eastern Front and signed the Treaty of Bucharest with the Central
   Powers in May 1918, ending the state of war between Romania and the
   Central Powers. Under the terms of the treaty, Romania had to give
   territory to Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, and lease its oil reserves
   to Germany. However, the terms also included the Central Powers
   recognition of the union of Bessarabia with Romania.^[166]^[167]

    United States enters the war

   on Germany, 2 April 1917

   The United States was a major supplier of war materiel to the Allies
   but remained neutral in 1914, in large part due to domestic
   opposition.^[168] The most significant factor in creating the support
   Wilson needed was the German submarine offensive, which not only cost
   American lives, but paralysed trade as ships were reluctant to put to
   sea.^[169]

   On 6 April 1917, Congress declared war on Germany as an "Associated
   Power" of the Allies.^[170] The United States Navy sent a battleship
   group to Scapa Flow to join the Grand Fleet and provided convoy
   escorts. In April 1917, the United States Army had fewer than 300,000
   men, including National Guard units, compared to British and French
   armies of 4.1 and 8.3 million respectively. The Selective Service Act
   of 1917 drafted 2.8 million men, although training and equipping such
   numbers was a huge logistical challenge. By June 1918, over 667,000
   members of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF), had been
   transported to France, a figure which reached 2 million by the end of
   November.^[171]

   Despite his conviction Germany must be defeated, Wilson went to war to
   ensure the US played a leading role in shaping the peace, which meant
   preserving the AEF as a separate military force, rather than being
   absorbed into British or French units as his Allies wanted.^[172] He
   was strongly supported by AEF commander General John J. Pershing, a
   proponent of pre-1914 "open warfare" who considered the French and
   British emphasis on artillery as misguided and incompatible with
   American "offensive spirit".^[173] Much to the frustration of his
   Allies, who had suffered heavy losses in 1917, he insisted on retaining
   control of American troops and refused to commit them to the front line
   until able to operate as independent units. As a result, the first
   significant US involvement was the Meuse–Argonne offensive in late
   September 1918.^[174]

   [260px-Assaut-chemin-des-dames.jpg] French infantry advance on the
   Chemin des Dames, April 1917

   In December 1916, Robert Nivelle replaced Pétain as commander of French
   armies on the Western Front and began planning a spring attack in
   Champagne, part of a joint Franco-British operation. Nivelle claimed
   the capture of his main objective, the Chemin des Dames, would achieve
   a massive breakthrough and cost no more than 15,000 casualties.^[175]
   Poor security meant German intelligence was well informed on tactics
   and timetables, but despite this, when the attack began on 16 April the
   French made substantial gains, before being brought to a halt by the
   newly built and extremely strong defences of the Hindenburg Line.
   Nivelle persisted with frontal assaults and by 25 April the French had
   suffered nearly 135,000 casualties, including 30,000 dead, most
   incurred in the first two days.^[176]
   Files of soldiers with rifles slung follow close behind a tank, there
   is a dead body in the foreground Canadian Corps troops at the Battle of
   Vimy Ridge, 1917

   Concurrent British attacks at Arras were more successful, although
   ultimately of little strategic value.^[177] Operating as a separate
   unit for the first time, the Canadian Corps capture of Vimy Ridge
   during the battle is viewed by many Canadians as a defining moment in
   creating a sense of national identity.^[178]^[179] Although Nivelle
   continued the offensive, on 3 May the 21st Division, which had been
   involved in some of the heaviest fighting at Verdun, refused orders to
   go into battle, initiating the French Army mutinies; within days, acts
   of "collective indiscipline" had spread to 54 divisions, while over
   20,000 deserted.^[180] Unrest was almost entirely confined to the
   infantry, whose demands were largely non-political, including better
   economic support for families at home, and regular periods of leave,
   which Nivelle had ended.^[181]

   In March and April 1917, at the First and Second Battles of Gaza,
   German and Ottoman forces stopped the advance of the Egyptian
   Expeditionary Force, which had begun in August 1916 at the Battle of
   Romani.^[182]^[183] At the end of October, the Sinai and Palestine
   campaign resumed, when General Edmund Allenby's XXth Corps, XXI Corps
   and Desert Mounted Corps won the Battle of Beersheba.^[184] Two Ottoman
   armies were defeated a few weeks later at the Battle of Mughar Ridge
   and, early in December, Jerusalem was captured following another
   Ottoman defeat at the Battle of Jerusalem.^[185]^[186]^[187] About this
   time, Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein was relieved of his
   duties as the Eighth Army's commander, replaced by Djevad Pasha, and a
   few months later the commander of the Ottoman Army in Palestine, Erich
   von Falkenhayn, was replaced by Otto Liman von Sanders.^[188]^[189]

   In early 1918, the front line was extended and the Jordan Valley was
   occupied, following the First Transjordan and the Second Transjordan
   attacks by British Empire forces in March and April 1918.^[190]

   In December 1917, the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia,
   thus freeing large numbers of German troops for use in the west. With
   German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in, the outcome
   was to be decided on the Western Front. The Central Powers knew that
   they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for
   success based on a final quick offensive.^[192] Ludendorff drew up
   plans (codenamed Operation Michael) for the 1918 offensive on the
   Western Front. The operation commenced on 21 March 1918 with an attack
   on British forces near Saint-Quentin. German forces achieved an
   unprecedented advance of 60 kilometres (37 mi).^[193] The initial
   offensive a success; after heavy fighting, however, the offensive was
   halted. Lacking tanks or motorised artillery, the Germans were unable
   to consolidate their gains. The problems of re-supply were also
   exacerbated by increasing distances that now stretched over terrain
   that was shell-torn and often impassable to traffic.^[194]

   Following this, Germany launched Operation Georgette against the
   northern English Channel ports. The Allies halted the drive after
   limited territorial gains by Germany. The German Army to the south then
   conducted Operations Blücher and Yorck, pushing broadly towards Paris.
   Germany launched Operation Marne (Second Battle of the Marne) on 15
   July, in an attempt to encircle Reims. The resulting counter-attack,
   which started the Hundred Days Offensive on 8 August,^[195] caused a
   marked collapse in German morale.^[196]^[197]^[198]

   By September, the Germans had fallen back to the Hindenburg Line. The
   Allies had advanced to the Hindenburg Line in the north and centre.
   German forces launch numerous counterattacks, but positions and
   outposts of the Line continued to fall, with the BEF alone taking
   30,441 prisoners in the last week of September. On 24 September,
   Supreme Army Command informed the leaders in Berlin that armistice
   talks were inevitable.^[199]

   The final assault on the Hindenburg Line began with the Meuse-Argonne
   offensive, launched by American and French troops on 26 September. Two
   days later the Allied armies (Belgian French and British) attacked
   around Ypres and the day after the British Fourth and French First Army
   at St Quentin in the centre of the line. The following week,
   co-operating American and French units broke through in Champagne at
   the Battle of Blanc Mont Ridge (3 October - 27 October), forcing the
   Germans off the commanding heights, and closing towards the Belgian
   frontier.^[200] On 8 October the Hindenburg Line was pierced again by
   British and Dominion troops of the First and Third British Armies at
   the Second Battle of Cambrai.^[201]

   Allied forces started the Vardar offensive on 15 September at two key
   points: Dobro Pole and near Dojran Lake. In the Battle of Dobro Pole,
   the Serbian and French armies had success after a three day long battle
   with relatively small casualties, and subsequently made a breakthrough
   in the front, something which was rarely seen in World War I. After the
   front was broken, Allied forces started to liberate Serbia and reached
   Skopje at 29 September, after which Bulgaria signed an armistice with
   the Allies on 30 September.^[202]^[203]

   The collapse of the Central Powers came swiftly. Bulgaria was the first
   to sign an armistice, the Armistice of Salonica on 29 September
   1918.^[204] German Emperor Wilhelm II in a telegram to Bulgarian Tsar
   Ferdinand I described the situation thus: "Disgraceful! 62,000 Serbs
   decided the war!".^[205]^[206] On the same day, the German Supreme Army
   Command informed Kaiser Wilhelm II and the Imperial Chancellor Count
   Georg von Hertling, that the military situation facing Germany was
   hopeless.^[207]

   On 24 October, the Italians began a push that rapidly recovered
   territory lost after the Battle of Caporetto. This culminated in the
   Battle of Vittorio Veneto, which marked the end of the Austro-Hungarian
   Army as an effective fighting force. The offensive also triggered the
   disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During the last week of
   October, declarations of independence were made in Budapest, Prague,
   and Zagreb. On 29 October, the imperial authorities asked Italy for an
   armistice, but the Italians continued advancing, reaching Trento,
   Udine, and Trieste. On 3 November, Austria-Hungary sent a flag of truce
   to ask for an armistice (Armistice of Villa Giusti). The terms,
   arranged by telegraph with the Allied Authorities in Paris, were
   communicated to the Austrian commander and accepted. The Armistice with
   Austria was signed in the Villa Giusti, near Padua, on 3 November.
   Austria and Hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow
   of the Habsburg monarchy. In the following days, the Italian Army
   occupied Innsbruck and all Tyrol with over 20,000 soldiers.^[208]

   On 30 October, the Ottoman Empire capitulated, signing the Armistice of
   Mudros.^[204]

   With the military faltering and with widespread loss of confidence in
   the Kaiser leading to his abdication and fleeing of the country,
   Germany moved towards surrender. Prince Maximilian of Baden took charge
   of a new government on 3 October as Chancellor of Germany to negotiate
   with the Allies. Negotiations with President Wilson began immediately,
   in the hope that he would offer better terms than the British and
   French. Wilson demanded a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary
   control over the German military.^[210]

   In northern Germany, the German Revolution of 1918–1919 began at the
   end of October 1918. Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a
   last, large-scale operation in a war they believed to be as good as
   lost, initiating the uprising. The sailors' revolt, which then ensued
   in the naval ports of Wilhelmshaven and Kiel, spread across the whole
   country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on
   9 November 1918, shortly thereafter to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm
   II, and to German surrender.^[211]^[212]^[213]^[214]^[215]

Aftermath

   Main article: Aftermath of World War I

   In the aftermath of the war, four empires disappeared: the German,
   Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian.^[m] Numerous nations regained
   their former independence, and new ones were created. Four dynasties,
   together with their ancillary aristocracies, fell as a result of the
   war: the Romanovs, the Hohenzollerns, the Habsburgs, and the Ottomans.
   Belgium and Serbia were badly damaged, as was France, with 1.4 million
   soldiers dead,^[216] not counting other casualties. Germany and Russia
   were similarly affected.^[217]

  Formal end of the war

   The signing of the Treaty of Versailles in the Hall of Mirrors,

   A formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven
   months, until the signing of the Treaty of Versailles with Germany on
   28 June 1919. The United States Senate did not ratify the treaty
   despite public support for it,^[218]^[219] and did not formally end its
   involvement in the war until the Knox–Porter Resolution was signed on
   2 July 1921 by President Warren G. Harding.^[220] For the United
   Kingdom and the British Empire, the state of war ceased under the
   provisions of the Termination of the Present War (Definition) Act 1918
   with respect to:

          + Germany on 10 January 1920.^[221]
          + Austria on 16 July 1920.^[222]
          + Bulgaria on 9 August 1920.^[223]
          + Hungary on 26 July 1921.^[224]
          + Turkey on 6 August 1924.^[225]

   [220px-Venizelos_signing_the_Treaty_of_Sevres.jpeg] Greek prime

   Some war memorials date the end of the war as being when the Versailles
   Treaty was signed in 1919, which was when many of the troops serving
   abroad finally returned home; by contrast, most commemorations of the
   war's end concentrate on the armistice of 11 November 1918.^[226]

  Peace treaties and national boundaries

   [280px-Map_Europe_1923-en.svg.png] Map of territorial changes in Europe
   after World War I (as of 1923)

   After the war, there grew a certain amount of academic focus on the
   causes of war and on the elements that could make peace flourish. In
   part, these led to the institutionalization of peace and conflict
   studies, security studies and International Relations (IR) in
   general.^[227] The Paris Peace Conference imposed a series of peace
   treaties on the Central Powers officially ending the war. The 1919
   Treaty of Versailles dealt with Germany and, building on Wilson's 14th
   point, brought into being the League of Nations on 28 June
   1919.^[228]^[229]

   The Central Powers had to acknowledge responsibility for "all the loss
   and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their
   nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon
   them by" their aggression. In the Treaty of Versailles, this statement
   was Article 231. This article became known as the War Guilt clause as
   the majority of Germans felt humiliated and resentful.^[230] Overall
   the Germans felt they had been unjustly dealt with by what they called
   the "diktat of Versailles". German historian Hagen Schulze said the
   Treaty placed Germany "under legal sanctions, deprived of military
   power, economically ruined, and politically humiliated."^[231] Belgian
   historian Laurence Van Ypersele emphasises the central role played by
   memory of the war and the Versailles Treaty in German politics in the
   1920s and 1930s:

     Active denial of war guilt in Germany and German resentment at both
     reparations and continued Allied occupation of the Rhineland made
     widespread revision of the meaning and memory of the war
     problematic. The legend of the "stab in the back" and the wish to
     revise the "Versailles diktat", and the belief in an international
     threat aimed at the elimination of the German nation persisted at
     the heart of German politics. Even a man of peace such as [Gustav]
     Stresemann publicly rejected German guilt. As for the Nazis, they
     waved the banners of domestic treason and international conspiracy
     in an attempt to galvanise the German nation into a spirit of
     revenge. Like a Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany sought to redirect the
     memory of the war to the benefit of its own policies.^[232]

   Meanwhile, new nations liberated from German rule viewed the treaty as
   recognition of wrongs committed against small nations by much larger
   aggressive neighbours.^[233]
   [280px-Dissolution_of_Austria-Hungary.png] Dissolution of
   Austria-Hungary after war

   Austria-Hungary was partitioned into several successor states, largely
   but not entirely along ethnic lines. Apart from Austria and Hungary,
   Czechoslovakia, Italy, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia received
   territories from the Dual Monarchy (the formerly separate and
   autonomous Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia was incorporated into
   Yugoslavia). The details were contained in the Saint-Germain-en-Laye
   and the Treaty of Trianon. As a result, Hungary lost 64% of its total
   population, decreasing from 20.9 million to 7.6 million and losing 31%
   (3.3 out of 10.7 million) of its ethnic Hungarians.^[234] According to
   the 1910 census, speakers of the Hungarian language included
   approximately 54% of the entire population of the Kingdom of Hungary.
   Within the country, numerous ethnic minorities were present: 16.1%
   Romanians, 10.5% Slovaks, 10.4% Germans, 2.5% Ruthenians, 2.5% Serbs
   and 8% others.^[235] Between 1920 and 1924, 354,000 Hungarians fled
   former Hungarian territories attached to Romania, Czechoslovakia, and
   Yugoslavia.^[236]

   The Russian Empire, which had withdrawn from the war in 1917 after the
   October Revolution, lost much of its western frontier as the newly
   independent nations of Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland
   were carved from it. Romania took control of Bessarabia in April
   1918.^[237]

  National identities

   Further information: Sykes–Picot Agreement

   After 123 years, Poland re-emerged as an independent country. The
   Kingdom of Serbia and its dynasty, as a "minor Entente nation" and the
   country with the most casualties per capita,^[238]^[239]^[240] became
   the backbone of a new multinational state, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats
   and Slovenes, later renamed Yugoslavia. Czechoslovakia, combining the
   Kingdom of Bohemia with parts of the Kingdom of Hungary, became a new
   nation. Romania would unite all Romanian-speaking people under a single
   state leading to Greater Romania.^[241]

   In the British Empire, the war unleashed new forms of nationalism. In
   Australia and New Zealand, the Battle of Gallipoli became known as
   those nations' "Baptism of Fire". It was the first major war in which
   the newly established countries fought, and it was one of the first
   times that Australian troops fought as Australians, not just subjects
   of the British Crown, and independent national identities for these
   nations took hold. Anzac Day, commemorating the Australian and New
   Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), celebrates this defining
   moment.^[242]^[243]

   In the aftermath of World War I, Greece fought against Turkish
   nationalists led by Mustafa Kemal, a war that eventually resulted in a
   massive population exchange between the two countries under the Treaty
   of Lausanne.^[244] According to various sources,^[245] several hundred
   thousand Greeks died during this period, which was tied in with the
   Greek genocide.^[246]

   Of the 60 million European military personnel who were mobilised from
   1914 to 1918, 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently
   disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured. Germany lost 15.1% of
   its active male population, Austria-Hungary lost 17.1%, and France lost
   10.5%.^[247] France mobilised 7.8 million men, of which 1.4 million
   died and 3.2 million were injured.^[248] Among the soldiers mutilated
   and surviving in the trenches, approximately 15,000 sustained horrific
   facial injuries, causing them to undergo social stigma and
   marginalisation; they were called the gueules cassées. In Germany,
   civilian deaths were 474,000 higher than in peacetime, due in large
   part to food shortages and malnutrition that weakened resistance to
   disease. These excess deaths are estimated as 271,000 in 1918, plus
   another 71,000 in the first half of 1919 when the blockade was still in
   effect.^[249] By the end of the war, starvation caused by famine had
   killed approximately 100,000 people in Lebanon.^[250] Between 5 and
   10 million people died in the Russian famine of 1921.^[251] By 1922,
   there were between 4.5 million and 7 million homeless children in
   Russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from World War I,
   the Russian Civil War, and the subsequent famine of 1920–1922.^[252]
   Numerous anti-Soviet Russians fled the country after the Revolution; by
   the 1930s, the northern Chinese city of Harbin had
   100,000 Russians.^[253]

   Diseases flourished in the chaotic wartime conditions. In 1914 alone,
   louse-borne epidemic typhus killed 200,000 in Serbia.^[254] From 1918
   to 1922, Russia had about 25 million infections and 3 million deaths
   from epidemic typhus.^[255] In 1923, 13 million Russians contracted
   malaria, a sharp increase from the pre-war years.^[256] Starting in
   early 1918, a major influenza epidemic known as Spanish flu spread
   around the world, accelerated by the movement of large number of
   soldiers, often crammed together in camps and transport ships with poor
   sanitation. Overall, the Spanish flu killed at least 17 million to
   25 million people,^[257]^[258] including an estimated 2.64 million
   Europeans and as many as 675,000 Americans.^[259] Moreover, between
   1915 and 1926, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica spread around the
   world affecting nearly five million people.^[260]^[261]

   if.jpg] French soldiers making a gas and flame attack on German
   trenches in Flanders

   The German army was the first to successfully deploy chemical weapons
   during the Second Battle of Ypres (22 April – 25 May 1915), after
   German scientists working under the direction of Fritz Haber at the
   Kaiser Wilhelm Institute developed a method to weaponize
   chlorine.^[n]^[262] The use of chemical weapons was sanctioned by the
   German High Command in an effort to force Allied soldiers out of their
   entrenched positions, complementing rather than supplanting more lethal
   conventional weapons.^[262] In time, chemical weapons were deployed by
   all major belligerents throughout the war, inflicting approximately
   1.3 million casualties, but relatively few fatalities: About 90,000 in
   total.^[262] For example, there were an estimated 186,000 British
   chemical weapons casualties during the war (80% of which were the
   result of exposure to the vesicant 'mustard gas', introduced to the
   battlefield by the Germans in July 1917, which burns the skin at any
   point of contact and inflicts more severe lung damage than chlorine or
   phosgene),^[262] and up to one-third of American casualties were caused
   by them. The Russian Army reportedly suffered roughly 500,000 chemical
   weapon casualties in World War I.^[263] The use of chemical weapons in
   warfare was in direct violation of the 1899 Hague Declaration
   Concerning Asphyxiating Gases and the 1907 Hague Convention on Land
   Warfare, which prohibited their use.^[264]^[265]

   The ethnic cleansing of the Ottoman Empire's Armenian population,
   including mass deportations and executions, during the final years of
   the Ottoman Empire is considered genocide.^[267] The Ottomans carried
   out organised and systematic massacres of the Armenian population at
   the beginning of the war and manipulated acts of Armenian resistance by
   portraying them as rebellions to justify further extermination.^[268]
   In early 1915, a number of Armenians volunteered to join the Russian
   forces and the Ottoman government used this as a pretext to issue the
   Tehcir Law (Law on Deportation), which authorised the deportation of
   Armenians from the Empire's eastern provinces to Syria between 1915 and
   1918. The Armenians were intentionally marched to death and a number
   were attacked by Ottoman brigands.^[269] While an exact number of
   deaths is unknown, the International Association of Genocide Scholars
   estimates 1.5 million.^[267]^[270] The government of Turkey has
   consistently denied the genocide, arguing that those who died were
   victims of inter-ethnic fighting, famine, or disease during World
   War I; these claims are rejected by most historians.^[271]

   Other ethnic groups were similarly attacked by the Ottoman Empire
   during this period, including Assyrians and Greeks, and some scholars
   consider those events to be part of the same policy of
   extermination.^[272]^[273]^[274] At least 250,000 Assyrian Christians,
   about half of the population, and 350,000–750,000 Anatolian and Pontic
   Greeks were killed between 1915 and 1922.^[275]

  Prisoners of war

   Ottoman forces after the First Battle of Gaza in 1917

   About eight million soldiers surrendered and were held in POW camps
   during the war. All nations pledged to follow the Hague Conventions on
   fair treatment of prisoners of war, and the survival rate for POWs was
   generally much higher than that of combatants at the front.^[276]

   25–31% of Russian losses (as a proportion of those captured, wounded,
   or killed) were to prisoner status, for Austria-Hungary 32%, for Italy
   26%, for France 12%, for Germany 9%; for Britain 7%. Prisoners from the
   Allied armies totalled about 1.4 million (not including Russia, which
   lost 2.5–3.5 million soldiers as prisoners). From the Central Powers
   about 3.3 million soldiers became prisoners; most of them surrendered
   to Russians.^[277]

Soldiers' experiences

   Allied personnel was around 42,928,000 while Central personnel was near
   25,248,000.^[217]^[278] The British soldiers of the war were initially
   volunteers but increasingly were conscripted into service. Surviving
   veterans, returning home, often found they could discuss their
   experiences only amongst themselves. Grouping together, they formed
   "veterans' associations" or "Legions". A small number of personal
   accounts of American veterans have been collected by the Library of
   Congress Veterans History Project.^[279]

   Conscription was common in most European countries. However, it was
   controversial in English-speaking countries.^[280] It was especially
   unpopular among minority ethnic groups—especially the Irish Catholics
   in Ireland^[281] and Australia,^[282]^[283] and the French Catholics in
   Canada.^[284]^[285]

   In the United States, conscription began in 1917 and was generally well
   received, with a few pockets of opposition in isolated rural
   areas.^[286] The administration decided to rely primarily on
   conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military
   manpower after only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial
   1 million target in the first six weeks of the war.^[287]

   Military and civilian observers from every major power closely followed
   the course of the war. Many were able to report on events from a
   perspective somewhat akin to modern "embedded" positions within the
   opposing land and naval forces.

   Macro- and micro-economic consequences devolved from the war. Families
   were altered by the departure of many men. With the death or absence of
   the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in
   unprecedented numbers. At the same time, industry needed to replace the
   lost labourers sent to war. This aided the struggle for voting rights
   for women.^[288]
   [220px-The_Girl_Behind_the_Gun_1915.jpg] Poster showing women workers,

   In all nations, the government's share of GDP increased, surpassing 50%
   in both Germany and France and nearly reaching that level in Britain.
   To pay for purchases in the United States, Britain cashed in its
   extensive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing
   heavily from Wall Street. President Wilson was on the verge of cutting
   off the loans in late 1916 but allowed a great increase in US
   government lending to the Allies. After 1919, the US demanded repayment
   of these loans. The repayments were, in part, funded by German
   reparations that, in turn, were supported by American loans to Germany.
   This circular system collapsed in 1931 and some loans were never
   repaid. Britain still owed the United States $4.4 billion^[o] of World
   War I debt in 1934; the last installment was finally paid in
   2015.^[289]

   Britain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war
   materials whose supply from traditional sources had become difficult.
   Geologists such as Albert Kitson were called on to find new resources
   of precious minerals in the African colonies. Kitson discovered
   important new deposits of manganese, used in munitions production, in
   the Gold Coast.^[290]

   Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles (the so-called "war guilt"
   clause) stated Germany accepted responsibility for "all the loss and
   damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their
   nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon
   them by the aggression of Germany and her allies."^[291] It was worded
   as such to lay a legal basis for reparations, and a similar clause was
   inserted in the treaties with Austria and Hungary. However, neither of
   them interpreted it as an admission of war guilt."^[292] In 1921, the
   total reparation sum was placed at 132 billion gold marks. However,
   "Allied experts knew that Germany could not pay" this sum. The total
   sum was divided into three categories, with the third being
   "deliberately designed to be chimerical" and its "primary function was
   to mislead public opinion ... into believing the "total sum was being
   maintained."^[293] Thus, 50 billion gold marks (12.5 billion dollars)
   "represented the actual Allied assessment of German capacity to pay"
   and "therefore … represented the total German reparations" figure that
   had to be paid.^[293]

   This figure could be paid in cash or in-kind (coal, timber, chemical
   dyes, etc.). In addition, some of the territory lost—via the treaty of
   Versailles—was credited towards the reparation figure as were other
   acts such as helping to restore the Library of Louvain.^[294] By 1929,
   the Great Depression arrived, causing political chaos throughout the
   world.^[295] In 1932 the payment of reparations was suspended by the
   international community, by which point Germany had paid only the
   equivalent of 20.598 billion gold marks in reparations.^[296] With the
   rise of Adolf Hitler, all bonds and loans that had been issued and
   taken out during the 1920s and early 1930s were cancelled. David
   Andelman notes "refusing to pay doesn't make an agreement null and
   void. The bonds, the agreement, still exist." Thus, following the
   Second World War, at the London Conference in 1953, Germany agreed to
   resume payment on the money borrowed. On 3 October 2010, Germany made
   the final payment on these bonds.^[p]

   The Australian prime minister, Billy Hughes, wrote to the British prime
   minister, David Lloyd George, "You have assured us that you cannot get
   better terms. I much regret it, and hope even now that some way may be
   found of securing agreement for demanding reparation commensurate with
   the tremendous sacrifices made by the British Empire and her Allies."
   Australia received £5,571,720 war reparations, but the direct cost of
   the war to Australia had been £376,993,052, and, by the mid-1930s,
   repatriation pensions, war gratuities, interest and sinking fund
   charges were £831,280,947.^[301] Of about 416,000 Australians who
   served, about 60,000 were killed and another 152,000 were
   wounded.^[217]

   The war contributed to the evolution of the wristwatch from women's
   jewellery to a practical everyday item, replacing the pocketwatch,
   which requires a free hand to operate.^[302] Trench watches were
   designed for use by the military as pocket watches were not as
   effective for combat. Military funding of advancements in radio
   contributed to the post-war popularity of the medium.^[302]

   Association

   In the Balkans, Yugoslav nationalists such as the leader, Ante Trumbić,
   strongly supported the war, desiring the freedom of Yugoslavs from
   Austria-Hungary and other foreign powers and the creation of an
   independent Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Committee, led by Trumbić, was
   formed in Paris on 30 April 1915 but shortly moved its office to
   London.^[303] In April 1918, the Rome Congress of Oppressed
   Nationalities met, including Czechoslovak, Italian, Polish,
   Transylvanian, and Yugoslav representatives who urged the Allies to
   support national self-determination for the peoples residing within
   Austria-Hungary.^[304]

   In the Middle East, Arab nationalism soared in Ottoman territories in
   response to the rise of Turkish nationalism during the war, with Arab
   nationalist leaders advocating the creation of a pan-Arab state. In
   1916, the Arab Revolt began in Ottoman-controlled territories of the
   Middle East in an effort to achieve independence.^[305]

   In East Africa, Iyasu V of Ethiopia was supporting the Dervish state
   who were at war with the British in the Somaliland campaign.^[306] Von
   Syburg, the German envoy in Addis Ababa, said, "now the time has come
   for Ethiopia to regain the coast of the Red Sea driving the Italians
   home, to restore the Empire to its ancient size." The Ethiopian Empire
   was on the verge of entering World War I on the side of the Central
   Powers before Iyasu's overthrow at the Battle of Segale due to Allied
   pressure on the Ethiopian aristocracy.^[307] Iyasu was accused of
   converting to Islam.^[308] According to Ethiopian historian Bahru
   Zewde, the evidence used to prove Iyasu's conversion was a doctored
   photo of Iyasu wearing a turban provided by the Allies.^[309] Some
   historians claim the British spy T. E. Lawrence forged the Iyasu
   photo.^[310]

   Guedecourt on 25 September 1916, merged with a Second Contingent. The
   two contingents suffered 75% casualties.

   A number of socialist parties initially supported the war when it began
   in August 1914.^[304] But European socialists split on national lines,
   with the concept of class conflict held by radical socialists such as
   Marxists and syndicalists being overborne by their patriotic support
   for the war.^[311] Once the war began, Austrian, British, French,
   German, and Russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current
   by supporting their countries' intervention in the war.^[312]

   Italian nationalism was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was
   initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions. One of
   the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of the
   war was Gabriele D'Annunzio, who promoted Italian irredentism and
   helped sway the Italian public to support intervention in the
   war.^[313] The Italian Liberal Party, under the leadership of Paolo
   Boselli, promoted intervention in the war on the side of the Allies and
   used the Dante Alighieri Society to promote Italian nationalism.^[314]
   Italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose
   it; some were militant supporters of the war, including Benito
   Mussolini and Leonida Bissolati.^[315] However, the Italian Socialist
   Party decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors were
   killed, resulting in a general strike called Red Week.^[316] The
   Italian Socialist Party purged itself of pro-war nationalist members,
   including Mussolini.^[316] Mussolini, a syndicalist who supported the
   war on grounds of irredentist claims on Italian-populated regions of
   Austria-Hungary, formed the pro-interventionist Il Popolo d'Italia and
   the Fasci Rivoluzionario d'Azione Internazionalista ("Revolutionary
   Fasci for International Action") in October 1914 that later developed
   into the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento in 1919, the origin of
   fascism.^[317] Mussolini's nationalism enabled him to raise funds from
   Ansaldo (an armaments firm) and other companies to create Il Popolo
   d'Italia to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the
   war.^[318]

    Patriotic funds

   On both sides there was large scale fundraising for soldiers' welfare,
   their dependents and for those injured. The Nail Men were a German
   example. Around the British Empire there were many patriotic funds,
   including the Royal Patriotic Fund Corporation, Canadian Patriotic
   Fund, Queensland Patriotic Fund and, by 1919, there were 983 funds in
   New Zealand.^[319] At the start of the next world war the New Zealand
   funds were reformed, having been criticised as overlapping, wasteful
   and abused,^[320] but 11 were still functioning in 2002.^[321]

  Opposition

   Main articles: Opposition to World War I and 1917 French Army mutinies

   Many countries jailed those who spoke out against the conflict. These
   included Eugene Debs in the United States and Bertrand Russell in
   Britain. In the US, the Espionage Act of 1917 and Sedition Act of 1918
   made it a federal crime to oppose military recruitment or make any
   statements deemed "disloyal". Publications at all critical of the
   government were removed from circulation by postal censors,^[322] and
   many served long prison sentences for statements of fact deemed
   unpatriotic.

   A number of nationalists opposed intervention, particularly within
   states that the nationalists were hostile to. Although the vast
   majority of Irish people consented to participate in the war in 1914
   and 1915, a minority of advanced Irish nationalists staunchly opposed
   taking part.^[323] The war began amid the Home Rule crisis in Ireland
   that had resurfaced in 1912, and by July 1914 there was a serious
   possibility of an outbreak of civil war in Ireland. Irish nationalists
   and Marxists attempted to pursue Irish independence, culminating in the
   Easter Rising of 1916, with Germany sending 20,000 rifles to Ireland to
   stir unrest in Britain.^[324] The UK government placed Ireland under
   martial law in response to the Easter Rising, though once the immediate
   threat of revolution had dissipated, the authorities did try to make
   concessions to nationalist feeling.^[325] However, opposition to
   involvement in the war increased in Ireland, resulting in the
   Conscription Crisis of 1918.

   Other opposition came from conscientious objectors—some socialist, some
   religious—who refused to fight. In Britain, 16,000 people asked for
   conscientious objector status.^[326] Some of them, most notably
   prominent peace activist Stephen Hobhouse, refused both military and
   alternative service.^[327] Many suffered years of prison, including
   solitary confinement and bread and water diets. Even after the war, in
   Britain many job advertisements were marked "No conscientious objectors
   need apply".^[328]

   On 1–4 May 1917, about 100,000 workers and soldiers of Petrograd, and
   after them, the workers and soldiers of other Russian cities, led by
   the Bolsheviks, demonstrated under banners reading "Down with the war!"
   and "all power to the soviets!" The mass demonstrations resulted in a
   crisis for the Russian Provisional Government.^[329] In Milan, in May
   1917, Bolshevik revolutionaries organised and engaged in rioting
   calling for an end to the war, and managed to close down factories and
   stop public transportation.^[330] The Italian army was forced to enter
   Milan with tanks and machine guns to face Bolsheviks and anarchists,
   who fought violently until 23 May when the army gained control of the
   city. Almost 50 people (including three Italian soldiers) were killed
   and over 800 people arrested.^[330]

Technology

   [220px-Sopwith_F-1_Camel.jpg] Royal Air Force Sopwith Camel. In April
   1917, the average life expectancy of a British pilot on the Western

   World War I began as a clash of 20th-century technology and
   19th-century tactics, with the inevitably large ensuing casualties. By
   the end of 1917, however, the major armies, now numbering millions of
   men, had modernised and were making use of telephone, wireless
   communication,^[332] armoured cars, tanks (especially with the advent
   of the first prototype tank, Little Willie), and aircraft.^[333]

   Artillery also underwent a revolution. In 1914, cannons were positioned
   in the front line and fired directly at their targets. By 1917,
   indirect fire with guns (as well as mortars and even machine guns) was
   commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably,
   aircraft and the often overlooked field telephone.^[334]

   Fixed-wing aircraft were initially used for reconnaissance and ground
   attack. To shoot down enemy planes, anti-aircraft guns and fighter
   aircraft were developed. Strategic bombers were created, principally by
   the Germans and British, though the former used Zeppelins as
   well.^[335] Towards the end of the conflict, aircraft carriers were
   used for the first time, with HMS Furious launching Sopwith Camels in a
   raid to destroy the Zeppelin hangars at Tønder in 1918.^[336]

Diplomacy

   [220px-Cartoon_for_a_Telegram.jpg] 1917 political cartoon about the
   Zimmermann Telegram

   The non-military diplomatic and propaganda interactions among the
   nations were designed to build support for the cause or to undermine
   support for the enemy. For the most part, wartime diplomacy focused on
   five issues: propaganda campaigns; defining and redefining the war
   goals, which became harsher as the war went on; luring neutral nations
   (Italy, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, Romania) into the coalition by
   offering slices of enemy territory; and encouragement by the Allies of
   nationalistic minority movements inside the Central Powers, especially
   among Czechs, Poles, and Arabs. In addition, there were multiple peace
   proposals coming from neutrals, or one side or the other; none of them
   progressed very far.^[337]^[338]^[339]

   Memorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns. Close to
   battlefields, those buried in improvised burial grounds were gradually
   moved to formal graveyards under the care of organisations such as the
   Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the American Battle Monuments
   Commission, the German War Graves Commission, and Le Souvenir français.
   Many of these graveyards also have central monuments to the missing or
   unidentified dead, such as the Menin Gate Memorial to the Missing and
   the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme.^[citation needed]

   In 1915, John McCrae, a Canadian army doctor, wrote the poem In
   Flanders Fields as a salute to those who perished in the Great War.
   Published in Punch on 8 December 1915, it is still recited today,
   especially on Remembrance Day and Memorial Day.^[340]^[341]

   National World War I Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri, is a
   memorial dedicated to all Americans who served in World War I. The
   Liberty Memorial was dedicated on 1 November 1921, when the supreme
   Allied commanders spoke to a crowd of more than 100,000 people.^[342]

   The UK Government has budgeted substantial resources to the
   commemoration of the war during the period 2014 to 2018. The lead body
   is the Imperial War Museum.^[343] On 3 August 2014, French President
   François Hollande and German President Joachim Gauck together marked
   the centenary of Germany's declaration of war on France by laying the
   first stone of a memorial in Vieil Armand, known in German as
   Hartmannswillerkopf, for French and German soldiers killed in the
   war.^[344] During the Armistice centenary commemorations, French
   President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited
   the site of the signing of the Armistice of Compiègne and unveiled a
   plaque to reconciliation.^[345]

  Historiography

   Further information: Historiography of the causes of World War I

   ... "Strange, friend," I said, "Here is no cause to mourn."
   "None," said the other, "Save the undone years"...

   — Wilfred Owen, Strange Meeting, 1918^[346]

   The first tentative efforts to comprehend the meaning and consequences
   of modern warfare began during the initial phases of the war; this
   process continued throughout and after the end of hostilities, and is
   still underway more than a century later. Teaching World War I has
   presented special challenges. When compared with World War II, the
   First World War is often thought to be "a wrong war fought for the
   wrong reasons"; it lacks the metanarrative of good versus evil that
   characterizes retellings of the Second World War. Lacking recognizable
   heroes and villains, it is often taught thematically, invoking tropes
   like the wastefulness of war, the folly of generals and the innocence
   of soldiers. The complexity of the conflict is mostly obscured by these
   oversimplifications.^[347] George Kennan referred to the war as the
   "seminal catastrophe of the 20th century".^[348]

   Historian Heather Jones argues that the historiography has been
   reinvigorated by a cultural turn in the 21st century. Scholars have
   raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation,
   radicalisation of politics, race, medical science, gender and mental
   health. Among the major subjects that historians have long debated
   regarding the war include: Why the war began; why the Allies won;
   whether generals were responsible for high casualty rates; how soldiers
   endured the poor conditions of trench warfare; and to what extent the
   civilian home front accepted and endorsed the war effort.^[349]^[350]

  Unexploded ordnance

   Further information: Zone rouge and Iron harvest

   As late as 2007, signs warning visitors to keep off certain paths at
   battlefield sites like Verdun and Somme remained in place as unexploded
   ordnance continued to pose a danger to farmers living near former
   battlegrounds. In France and Belgium locals who discover caches of
   unexploded munitions are assisted by weapons disposal units. In some
   places, plant life has still not returned to normal.^[347]

   World War II (WWII or WW2) or the Second World War was a global
   conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast majority of the
   world's countries, including all the great powers, fought as part of
   two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many
   participating countries invested all available economic, industrial,
   and scientific capabilities into this total war, blurring the
   distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a
   major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and
   delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. It was by
   far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in 70–85 million
   fatalities.

   Millions died due to genocides, including the Holocaust, as well as
   starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of Axis defeat,
   Germany, Austria and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were
   conducted against German and Japanese leaders.

   The causes of the war are debated; contributing factors included the
   rise of fascism in Europe, the Spanish Civil War, the Second
   Sino-Japanese War, Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, and tensions in
   the aftermath of World War I. World War II is generally considered to
   have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler,
   invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany
   on 3 September. Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939,
   Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out
   their "spheres of influence" across Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania
   and Romania. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and
   treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe,
   in a military alliance, called the Axis, with Italy, Japan, and other
   countries. Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East
   Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued primarily
   between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with the war
   in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the UK, and
   the Battle of the Atlantic. In June 1941, Germany led the European Axis
   powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front,
   the largest land theatre of war in history.

   Japan aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, and by 1937 was at war
   with the Republic of China. In December 1941, Japan attacked American
   and British territories with near-simultaneous offensives against
   Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific, including an attack on Pearl
   Harbor which resulted in the United States and the United Kingdom
   declaring war against Japan. The European Axis powers declared war on
   the US in solidarity. Japan soon conquered much of the western Pacific,
   but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical Battle
   of Midway; Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at
   Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943—including German
   defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and
   Italian mainland, and Allied offensives in the Pacific—cost the Axis
   powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all
   fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France,
   while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and pushed
   Germany and its allies back. During 1944–1945, Japan suffered reversals
   in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and
   captured key western Pacific islands. The war in Europe concluded with
   the liberation of German-occupied territories; the invasion of Germany
   by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the Fall of
   Berlin to Soviet troops; Hitler's suicide; and the German unconditional
   surrender on 8 May 1945.

   Following the refusal of Japan to surrender on the terms of the Potsdam
   Declaration, the US dropped the first atomic bombs on Hiroshima on
   6 August and Nagasaki on 9 August. Faced with imminent invasion of the
   Japanese archipelago, the possibility of more atomic bombings, and the
   Soviet Union's declared entry into the war against Japan on the eve of
   invading Manchuria, Japan announced on 10 August its intention to
   surrender, signing a surrender document on 2 September 1945.

   World War II changed the political alignment and social structure of
   the world, and set the foundation for the international order for the
   rest of the 20th century and into the 21st century. The United Nations
   was established to foster international cooperation and prevent
   conflicts, with the victorious great powers—China, France, the Soviet
   Union, the UK, and the US—becoming the permanent members of its
   Security Council. The Soviet Union and the US emerged as rival
   superpowers, setting the stage for the Cold War. In the wake of
   European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned,
   triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose
   industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and
   expansion.

   World War II began in Europe on 1 September 1939^[1]^[2] with the
   German invasion of Poland and the United Kingdom and France's
   declaration of war on Germany two days later on 3 September 1939. Dates
   for the beginning of the Pacific War include the start of the Second
   Sino-Japanese War on 7 July 1937,^[3]^[4] or the earlier Japanese
   invasion of Manchuria, on 19 September 1931.^[5]^[6] Others follow the
   British historian A. J. P. Taylor, who stated that the Sino-Japanese
   War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously, and the
   two wars became World War II in 1941.^[7] Other theorized starting
   dates for World War II include the Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3
   October 1935.^[8] The British historian Antony Beevor views the
   beginning of World War II as the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought between
   Japan and the forces of Mongolia and the Soviet Union from May to
   September 1939.^[9] Others view the Spanish Civil War as the start or
   prelude to World War II.^[10]^[11]

   The exact date of the war's end is not universally agreed upon. It was
   generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of
   15 August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than with the formal surrender of
   Japan on 2 September 1945, which officially ended the war in Asia. A
   peace treaty between Japan and the Allies was signed in 1951.^[12] A
   1990 treaty regarding Germany's future allowed the reunification of
   East and West Germany to take place and resolved most post–World War II
   issues.^[13] No formal peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union
   was ever signed,^[14] although the state of war between the two
   countries was terminated by the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of
   1956, which also restored full diplomatic relations between them.^[15]

   gssaal.jpg] The League of Nations assembly, held in Geneva,
   Switzerland, 1930

   World War I had radically altered the political European map with the
   defeat of the Central Powers—including Austria-Hungary, Germany,
   Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire—and the 1917 Bolshevik seizure of
   power in Russia, which led to the founding of the Soviet Union.
   Meanwhile, the victorious Allies of World War I, such as France,
   Belgium, Italy, Romania, and Greece, gained territory, and new
   nation-states were created out of the collapse of Austria-Hungary and
   the Ottoman and Russian Empires.^[citation needed]

   To prevent a future world war, the League of Nations was established in
   1920 by the Paris Peace Conference. The organisation's primary goals
   were to prevent armed conflict through collective security, military
   and naval disarmament, and settling international disputes through
   peaceful negotiations and arbitration.^[16]

   Despite strong pacifist sentiment after World War I,^[17] irredentist
   and revanchist nationalism had emerged in several European states.
   These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the
   significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses imposed by the
   Treaty of Versailles. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent
   of its home territory and all its overseas possessions, while German
   annexation of other states was prohibited, reparations were imposed,
   and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's
   armed forces.^[18]

    Germany

   The German Empire was dissolved in the German Revolution of 1918–1919,
   and a democratic government, later known as the Weimar Republic, was
   created. The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new
   republic and hardline opponents on both the political right and left.
   Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains;
   however, Italian nationalists were angered that the promises made by
   the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war
   were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the
   Fascist movement led by Benito Mussolini seized power in Italy with a
   nationalist, totalitarian, and class collaborationist agenda that
   abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing, and
   liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy
   aimed at making Italy a world power, promising the creation of a "New
   Roman Empire".^[19]
   [170px-N%C3%BCrnberg_Reichsparteitag_Hitler_retouched.jpg] Adolf Hitler
   at a German Nazi political rally in Nuremberg, August 1933

   Adolf Hitler, after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German
   government in 1923, eventually became the Chancellor of Germany in 1933
   when Paul von Hindenburg and the Reichstag appointed him. Following
   Hindenburg's death in 1934, Hitler proclaimed himself Führer of Germany
   and abolished democracy, espousing a radical, racially motivated
   revision of the world order, and soon began a massive rearmament
   campaign.^[20] France, seeking to secure its alliance with Italy,
   allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia, which Italy desired as a
   colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when
   the Territory of the Saar Basin was legally reunited with Germany, and
   Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament
   programme, and introduced conscription.^[21]

    European treaties

   The United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the Stresa Front in April
   1935 in order to contain Germany, a key step towards military
   globalisation; however, that June, the United Kingdom made an
   independent naval agreement with Germany, easing prior restrictions.
   The Soviet Union, concerned by Germany's goals of capturing vast areas
   of Eastern Europe, drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France.
   Before taking effect, though, the Franco-Soviet pact was required to go
   through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it
   essentially toothless.^[22] The United States, concerned with events in
   Europe and Asia, passed the Neutrality Act in August of the same
   year.^[23]

   Hitler defied the Versailles and Locarno Treaties by remilitarising the
   Rhineland in March 1936, encountering little opposition due to the
   policy of appeasement.^[24] In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed
   the Rome–Berlin Axis. A month later, Germany and Japan signed the
   Anti-Comintern Pact, which Italy joined the following year.^[25]

    Asia

   The Kuomintang (KMT) party in China launched a unification campaign
   against regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s,
   but was soon embroiled in a civil war against its former Chinese
   Communist Party allies^[26] and new regional warlords. In 1931, an
   increasingly militaristic Empire of Japan, which had long sought
   influence in China^[27] as the first step of what its government saw as
   the country's right to rule Asia, staged the Mukden incident as a
   pretext to invade Manchuria and establish the puppet state of
   Manchukuo.^[28]

   China appealed to the League of Nations to stop the Japanese invasion
   of Manchuria. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being
   condemned for its incursion into Manchuria. The two nations then fought
   several battles, in Shanghai, Rehe and Hebei, until the Tanggu Truce
   was signed in 1933. Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the
   resistance to Japanese aggression in Manchuria, and Chahar and
   Suiyuan.^[29] After the 1936 Xi'an Incident, the Kuomintang and
   communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a united front to
   oppose Japan.^[30]

  Pre-war events

    Italian invasion of Ethiopia (1935)

   Main article: Second Italo-Ethiopian War

   [220px-Mussolini_truppe_Etiopia.jpg] Benito Mussolini inspecting troops
   during the Italo-Ethiopian War, 1935

   The Second Italo-Ethiopian War was a brief colonial war that began in
   October 1935 and ended in May 1936. The war began with the invasion of
   the Ethiopian Empire (also known as Abyssinia) by the armed forces of
   the Kingdom of Italy (Regno d'Italia), which was launched from Italian
   Somaliland and Eritrea.^[31] The war resulted in the military
   occupation of Ethiopia and its annexation into the newly created colony
   of Italian East Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana, or AOI); in addition
   it exposed the weakness of the League of Nations as a force to preserve
   peace. Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations, but the League did
   little when the former clearly violated Article X of the League's
   Covenant.^[32] The United Kingdom and France supported imposing
   sanctions on Italy for the invasion, but the sanctions were not fully
   enforced and failed to end the Italian invasion.^[33] Italy
   subsequently dropped its objections to Germany's goal of absorbing
   Austria.^[34]

    Spanish Civil War (1936–1939)

   Main article: Spanish Civil War

   When civil war broke out in Spain, Hitler and Mussolini lent military
   support to the Nationalist rebels, led by General Francisco Franco.
   Italy supported the Nationalists to a greater extent than the Nazis:
   Mussolini sent more than 70,000 ground troops, 6,000 aviation
   personnel, and 720 aircraft to Spain.^[35] The Soviet Union supported
   the existing government of the Spanish Republic. More than 30,000
   foreign volunteers, known as the International Brigades, also fought
   against the Nationalists. Both Germany and the Soviet Union used this
   proxy war as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced
   weapons and tactics. The Nationalists won the civil war in April 1939;
   Franco, now dictator, remained officially neutral during World War II
   but generally favoured the Axis.^[36] His greatest collaboration with
   Germany was the sending of volunteers to fight on the Eastern
   Front.^[37]

    Japanese invasion of China (1937)

   [220px-Shanghai1937IJA_ruins.jpg] Imperial Japanese Army soldiers
   during the Battle of Shanghai, 1937

   Main article: Second Sino-Japanese War

   In July 1937, Japan captured the former Chinese imperial capital of
   Peking after instigating the Marco Polo Bridge incident, which
   culminated in the Japanese campaign to invade all of China.^[38] The
   Soviets quickly signed a non-aggression pact with China to lend
   materiel support, effectively ending China's prior cooperation with
   Germany. From September to November, the Japanese attacked Taiyuan,
   engaged the Kuomintang Army around Xinkou,^[39]^[unreliable source?]
   and fought Communist forces in Pingxingguan.^[40]^[41] Generalissimo
   Chiang Kai-shek deployed his best army to defend Shanghai, but after
   three months of fighting, Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push
   Chinese forces back, capturing the capital Nanking in December 1937.
   After the fall of Nanking, tens or hundreds of thousands of Chinese
   civilians and disarmed combatants were murdered by the
   Japanese.^[42]^[43]

   In March 1938, Nationalist Chinese forces won their first major victory
   at Taierzhuang, but then the city of Xuzhou was taken by the Japanese
   in May.^[44]^[unreliable source?] In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled
   the Japanese advance by flooding the Yellow River; this manoeuvre
   bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at Wuhan, but the
   city was taken by October.^[45] Japanese military victories did not
   bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to
   achieve; instead, the Chinese government relocated inland to Chongqing
   and continued the war.^[46]^[47]

    Soviet–Japanese border conflicts

   Main article: Soviet–Japanese border conflicts

   In the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese forces in Manchukuo had sporadic
   border clashes with the Soviet Union and Mongolia. The Japanese
   doctrine of Hokushin-ron, which emphasised Japan's expansion northward,
   was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. This policy would
   prove difficult to maintain in light of the Japanese defeat at Khalkin
   Gol in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War^[48] and ally Nazi
   Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets. Japan and the Soviet
   Union eventually signed a Neutrality Pact in April 1941, and Japan
   adopted the doctrine of Nanshin-ron, promoted by the Navy, which took
   its focus southward and eventually led to war with the United States
   and the Western Allies.^[49]^[50]

    European occupations and agreements

   [220px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-R69173%2C_M%C3%BCnchener_Abkommen%2C_Staat
   schefs.jpg] Chamberlain, Daladier, Hitler, Mussolini, and Ciano
   pictured just before signing the Munich Agreement, 29 September 1938

   In Europe, Germany and Italy were becoming more aggressive. In March
   1938, Germany annexed Austria, again provoking little response from
   other European powers.^[51] Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German
   claims on the Sudetenland, an area of Czechoslovakia with a
   predominantly ethnic German population. Soon the United Kingdom and
   France followed the appeasement policy of British Prime Minister
   Neville Chamberlain and conceded this territory to Germany in the
   Munich Agreement, which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak
   government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial
   demands.^[52] Soon afterwards, Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia
   to cede additional territory to Hungary, and Poland annexed the
   Trans-Olza region of Czechoslovakia.^[53]

   Although all of Germany's stated demands had been satisfied by the
   agreement, privately Hitler was furious that British interference had
   prevented him from seizing all of Czechoslovakia in one operation. In
   subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish "war-mongers"
   and in January 1939 secretly ordered a major build-up of the German
   navy to challenge British naval supremacy. In March 1939, Germany
   invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia and subsequently split it into
   the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and a pro-German client
   state, the Slovak Republic.^[54] Hitler also delivered an ultimatum to
   Lithuania on 20 March 1939, forcing the concession of the Klaipėda
   Region, formerly the German Memelland.^[55]
   [170px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-H27337%2C_Moskau%2C_Stalin_und_Ribbentrop_
   im_Kreml.jpg] German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop (right)
   and the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, after signing the
   Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, 23 August 1939

   Greatly alarmed and with Hitler making further demands on the Free City
   of Danzig, the United Kingdom and France guaranteed their support for
   Polish independence; when Italy conquered Albania in April 1939, the
   same guarantee was extended to the Kingdoms of Romania and Greece.^[56]
   Shortly after the Franco-British pledge to Poland, Germany and Italy
   formalised their own alliance with the Pact of Steel.^[57] Hitler
   accused the United Kingdom and Poland of trying to "encircle" Germany
   and renounced the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German–Polish
   declaration of non-aggression.^[58]

   The situation became a crisis in late August as German troops continued
   to mobilise against the Polish border. On 23 August the Soviet Union
   signed a non-aggression pact with Germany,^[59] after tripartite
   negotiations for a military alliance between France, the United
   Kingdom, and Soviet Union had stalled.^[60] This pact had a secret
   protocol that defined German and Soviet "spheres of influence" (western
   Poland and Lithuania for Germany; eastern Poland, Finland, Estonia,
   Latvia and Bessarabia for the Soviet Union), and raised the question of
   continuing Polish independence.^[61] The pact neutralised the
   possibility of Soviet opposition to a campaign against Poland and
   assured that Germany would not have to face the prospect of a two-front
   war, as it had in World War I. Immediately afterwards, Hitler ordered
   the attack to proceed on 26 August, but upon hearing that the United
   Kingdom had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with Poland and
   that Italy would maintain neutrality, he decided to delay it.^[62]

   In response to British requests for direct negotiations to avoid war,
   Germany made demands on Poland, which served as a pretext to worsen
   relations.^[63] On 29 August, Hitler demanded that a Polish
   plenipotentiary immediately travel to Berlin to negotiate the handover
   of Danzig, and to allow a plebiscite in the Polish Corridor in which
   the German minority would vote on secession.^[63] The Poles refused to
   comply with the German demands, and on the night of 30–31 August in a
   confrontational meeting with the British ambassador Nevile Henderson,
   Ribbentrop declared that Germany considered its claims rejected.^[64]

   On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland after having staged several
   false flag border incidents as a pretext to initiate the invasion.^[65]
   The first German attack of the war came against the Polish defenses at
   Westerplatte.^[66] The United Kingdom responded with an ultimatum for
   Germany to cease military operations, and on 3 September, after the
   ultimatum was ignored, Britain and France declared war on Germany,^[67]
   followed by Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Canada. During
   the Phoney War period, the alliance provided no direct military support
   to Poland, outside of a cautious French probe into the Saarland.^[68]
   The Western Allies also began a naval blockade of Germany, which aimed
   to damage the country's economy and war effort.^[69] Germany responded
   by ordering U-boat warfare against Allied merchant and warships, which
   would later escalate into the Battle of the Atlantic.^[70]

   On 8 September, German troops reached the suburbs of Warsaw. The Polish
   counter-offensive to the west halted the German advance for several
   days, but it was outflanked and encircled by the Wehrmacht. Remnants of
   the Polish army broke through to besieged Warsaw. On 17 September 1939,
   two days after signing a cease-fire with Japan, the Soviet Union
   invaded Poland^[71] under the supposed pretext that the Polish state
   had ceased to exist.^[72] On 27 September, the Warsaw garrison
   surrendered to the Germans, and the last large operational unit of the
   Polish Army surrendered on 6 October. Despite the military defeat,
   Poland never surrendered; instead, it formed the Polish
   government-in-exile and a clandestine state apparatus remained in
   occupied Poland.^[73] A significant part of Polish military personnel
   evacuated to Romania and Latvia; many of them later fought against the
   Axis in other theatres of the war.^[74]

   Germany annexed western Poland and occupied central Poland; the Soviet
   Union annexed eastern Poland; small shares of Polish territory were
   transferred to Lithuania and Slovakia. On 6 October, Hitler made a
   public peace overture to the United Kingdom and France but said that
   the future of Poland was to be determined exclusively by Germany and
   the Soviet Union. The proposal was rejected^[64] and Hitler ordered an
   immediate offensive against France,^[75] which was postponed until the
   spring of 1940 due to bad weather.^[76]^[77]^[78]

   After the outbreak of war in Poland, Stalin threatened Estonia, Latvia,
   and Lithuania with military invasion, forcing the three Baltic
   countries to sign pacts allowing the creation of Soviet military bases
   in these countries; in October 1939, significant Soviet military
   contingents were moved there.^[79]^[80]^[81] Finland refused to sign a
   similar pact and rejected ceding part of its territory to the Soviet
   Union. The Soviet Union invaded Finland in November 1939,^[82] and was
   subsequently expelled from the League of Nations for this crime of
   aggression.^[83] Despite overwhelming numerical superiority, Soviet
   military success during the Winter War was modest,^[84] and the
   Finno-Soviet war ended in March 1940 with some Finnish concessions of
   territory.^[85]

   In June 1940, the Soviet Union occupied the entire territories of
   Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,^[80] as well as the Romanian regions of
   Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and the Hertsa region. In August 1940,
   Hitler imposed the Second Vienna Award on Romania which led to the
   transfer of Northern Transylvania to Hungary.^[86] In September 1940,
   Bulgaria demanded Southern Dobruja from Romania with German and Italian
   support, leading to the Treaty of Craiova.^[87] The loss of one-third
   of Romania's 1939 territory caused a coup against King Carol II,
   turning Romania into a fascist dictatorship under Marshal Ion
   Antonescu, with a course set towards the Axis in the hopes of a German
   guarantee.^[88] Meanwhile, German-Soviet political relations and
   economic co-operation^[89]^[90] gradually stalled,^[91]^[92] and both
   states began preparations for war.^[93]

    Western Europe (1940–1941)

   Main article: Western Front (World War II)

   [310px-WWIIEuropeMay40.gif] German advance into Belgium and Northern
   France, 10 May – 4 June 1940, swept past the Maginot Line (shown in
   dark red)

   In April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway to protect shipments
   of iron ore from Sweden, which the Allies were attempting to cut
   off.^[94] Denmark capitulated after six hours, and despite Allied
   support, Norway was conquered within two months.^[95] British
   discontent over the Norwegian campaign led to the resignation of Prime
   Minister Neville Chamberlain, who was replaced by Winston Churchill on
   10 May 1940.^[96]

   On the same day, Germany launched an offensive against France. To
   circumvent the strong Maginot Line fortifications on the Franco-German
   border, Germany directed its attack at the neutral nations of Belgium,
   the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.^[97] The Germans carried out a
   flanking manoeuvre through the Ardennes region,^[98] which was
   mistakenly perceived by the Allies as an impenetrable natural barrier
   against armoured vehicles.^[99]^[100] By successfully implementing new
   Blitzkrieg tactics, the Wehrmacht rapidly advanced to the Channel and
   cut off the Allied forces in Belgium, trapping the bulk of the Allied
   armies in a cauldron on the Franco-Belgian border near Lille. The
   United Kingdom was able to evacuate a significant number of Allied
   troops from the continent by early June, although they had to abandon
   almost all their equipment.^[101]

   On 10 June, Italy invaded France, declaring war on both France and the
   United Kingdom.^[102] The Germans turned south against the weakened
   French army, and Paris fell to them on 14 June. Eight days later France
   signed an armistice with Germany; it was divided into German and
   Italian occupation zones,^[103] and an unoccupied rump state under the
   Vichy Regime, which, though officially neutral, was generally aligned
   with Germany. France kept its fleet, which the United Kingdom attacked
   on 3 July in an attempt to prevent its seizure by Germany.^[104]
   [220px-View_from_St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_after_the_Blitz.jpg] London seen

   The air Battle of Britain^[105] began in early July with Luftwaffe
   attacks on shipping and harbours.^[106] The United Kingdom rejected
   Hitler's peace offer,^[107] and the German air superiority campaign
   started in August but failed to defeat RAF Fighter Command, forcing the
   indefinite postponement of the proposed German invasion of Britain. The
   German strategic bombing offensive intensified with night attacks on
   London and other cities in the Blitz, but largely ended in May
   1941^[108] after failing to significantly disrupt the British war
   effort.^[106]

   Using newly captured French ports, the German Navy enjoyed success
   against an over-extended Royal Navy, using U-boats against British
   shipping in the Atlantic.^[109] The British Home Fleet scored a
   significant victory on 27 May 1941 by sinking the German battleship
   Bismarck.^[110]

   In November 1939, the United States was assisting China and the Western
   Allies, and had amended the Neutrality Act to allow "cash and carry"
   purchases by the Allies.^[111] In 1940, following the German capture of
   Paris, the size of the United States Navy was significantly increased.
   In September the United States further agreed to a trade of American
   destroyers for British bases.^[112] Still, a large majority of the
   American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in
   the conflict well into 1941.^[113] In December 1940, Roosevelt accused
   Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as
   useless, calling for the United States to become an "arsenal of
   democracy" and promoting Lend-Lease programmes of military and
   humanitarian aid to support the British war effort; Lend-Lease was
   later extended to the other Allies, including the Soviet Union after it
   was invaded by Germany.^[107] The United States started strategic
   planning to prepare for a full-scale offensive against Germany.^[114]

   At the end of September 1940, the Tripartite Pact formally united
   Japan, Italy, and Germany as the Axis powers. The Tripartite Pact
   stipulated that any country—with the exception of the Soviet Union—that
   attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all
   three.^[115] The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia,
   and Romania joined.^[116] Romania and Hungary later made major
   contributions to the Axis war against the Soviet Union, in Romania's
   case partially to recapture territory ceded to the Soviet Union.^[117]

    Mediterranean (1940–1941)

   Main article: Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II

   In early June 1940, the Italian Regia Aeronautica attacked and besieged
   Malta, a British possession. From late summer to early autumn, Italy
   conquered British Somaliland and made an incursion into British-held
   Egypt. In October, Italy attacked Greece, but the attack was repulsed
   with heavy Italian casualties; the campaign ended within months with
   minor territorial changes.^[118] To assist Italy and prevent Britain
   from gaining a foothold, Germany prepared to invade the Balkans, which
   would threaten Romanian oil fields and strike against British dominance
   of the Mediterranean.^[119]

   North African desert, April–May 1941

   In December 1940, British Empire forces began counter-offensives
   against Italian forces in Egypt and Italian East Africa.^[120] The
   offensives were successful; by early February 1941, Italy had lost
   control of eastern Libya, and large numbers of Italian troops had been
   taken prisoner. The Italian Navy also suffered significant defeats,
   with the Royal Navy putting three Italian battleships out of commission
   after a carrier attack at Taranto, and neutralising several more
   warships at the Battle of Cape Matapan.^[121]

   Italian defeats prompted Germany to deploy an expeditionary force to
   North Africa; at the end of March 1941, Rommel's Afrika Korps launched
   an offensive which drove back Commonwealth forces.^[122] In less than a
   month, Axis forces advanced to western Egypt and besieged the port of
   Tobruk.^[123]

   By late March 1941, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact;
   however, the Yugoslav government was overthrown two days later by
   pro-British nationalists. Germany and Italy responded with simultaneous
   invasions of both Yugoslavia and Greece, commencing on 6 April 1941;
   both nations were forced to surrender within the month.^[124] The
   airborne invasion of the Greek island of Crete at the end of May
   completed the German conquest of the Balkans.^[125] Partisan warfare
   subsequently broke out against the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, which
   continued until the end of the war.^[126]

   In the Middle East in May, Commonwealth forces quashed an uprising in
   Iraq which had been supported by German aircraft from bases within
   Vichy-controlled Syria.^[127] Between June and July, British-led forces
   invaded and occupied the French possessions of Syria and Lebanon,
   assisted by the Free French.^[128]

    Axis attack on the Soviet Union (1941)

   Main article: Eastern Front (World War II)

   powers

   With the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany,
   Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations for war. With the Soviets
   wary of mounting tensions with Germany, and the Japanese planning to
   take advantage of the European War by seizing resource-rich European
   possessions in Southeast Asia, the two powers signed the
   Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941.^[129] By contrast, the
   Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet
   Union, massing forces on the Soviet border.^[130]

   Hitler believed that the United Kingdom's refusal to end the war was
   based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would
   enter the war against Germany sooner or later.^[131] On 31 July 1940,
   Hitler decided that the Soviet Union should be eliminated and aimed for
   the conquest of Ukraine, the Baltic states and Byelorussia.^[132]
   However, other senior German officials like Ribbentrop saw an
   opportunity to create a Euro-Asian bloc against the British Empire by
   inviting the Soviet Union into the Tripartite Pact.^[133] In November
   1940, negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would
   join the pact. The Soviets showed some interest but asked for
   concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany
   considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the
   directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.^[134]

   On 22 June 1941, Germany, supported by Italy and Romania, invaded the
   Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, with Germany accusing the Soviets
   of plotting against them; they were joined shortly by Finland and
   Hungary.^[135] The primary targets of this surprise
   offensive^[136]^[page needed] were the Baltic region, Moscow and
   Ukraine, with the ultimate goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the
   Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line—from the Caspian to the White Seas. Hitler's
   objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power,
   exterminate Communism, generate Lebensraum ("living space")^[137] by
   dispossessing the native population,^[138] and guarantee access to the
   strategic resources needed to defeat Germany's remaining rivals.^[139]

   Although the Red Army was preparing for strategic counter-offensives
   before the war,^[140] Operation Barbarossa forced the Soviet supreme
   command to adopt strategic defence. During the summer, the Axis made
   significant gains into Soviet territory, inflicting immense losses in
   both personnel and materiel. By mid-August, however, the German Army
   High Command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably
   depleted Army Group Centre, and to divert the 2nd Panzer Group to
   reinforce troops advancing towards central Ukraine and Leningrad.^[141]
   The Kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful, resulting in
   encirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies, and made possible
   further advance into Crimea and industrially-developed Eastern Ukraine
   (the First Battle of Kharkov).^[142]

   The diversion of three-quarters of the Axis troops and the majority of
   their air forces from France and the central Mediterranean to the
   Eastern Front^[143] prompted the United Kingdom to reconsider its grand
   strategy.^[144] In July, the UK and the Soviet Union formed a military
   alliance against Germany^[145] and in August, the United Kingdom and
   the United States jointly issued the Atlantic Charter, which outlined
   British and American goals for the post-war world.^[146] In late August
   the British and Soviets invaded neutral Iran to secure the Persian
   Corridor, Iran's oil fields, and preempt any Axis advances through Iran
   toward the Baku oil fields or India.^[147]

   By October, Axis powers had achieved operational objectives in Ukraine
   and the Baltic region, with only the sieges of Leningrad^[148] and
   Sevastopol continuing.^[149] A major offensive against Moscow was
   renewed; after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh
   weather, the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow,
   where the exhausted troops^[150] were forced to suspend the
   offensive.^[151] Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces, but
   their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: two key
   cities remained in Soviet hands, the Soviet capability to resist was
   not broken, and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its
   military potential. The blitzkrieg phase of the war in Europe had
   ended.^[152]

   By early December, freshly mobilised reserves^[153] allowed the Soviets
   to achieve numerical parity with Axis troops.^[154] This, as well as
   intelligence data which established that a minimal number of Soviet
   troops in the East would be sufficient to deter any attack by the
   Japanese Kwantung Army,^[155] allowed the Soviets to begin a massive
   counter-offensive that started on 5 December all along the front and
   pushed German troops 100–250 kilometres (62–155 mi) west.^[156]

    War breaks out in the Pacific (1941)

   Main article: Pacific War

   [220px-228_regiment_in_HK.jpg] Japanese soldiers entering Hong Kong, 8

   Following the Japanese false flag Mukden incident in 1931, the Japanese
   shelling of the American gunboat USS Panay in 1937, and the 1937–1938
   Nanjing Massacre, Japanese-American relations deteriorated. In 1939,
   the United States notified Japan that it would not be extending its
   trade treaty and American public opinion opposing Japanese expansionism
   led to a series of economic sanctions—the Export Control Acts—which
   banned U.S. exports of chemicals, minerals and military parts to Japan,
   and increased economic pressure on the Japanese
   regime.^[107]^[157]^[158] During 1939 Japan launched its first attack
   against Changsha, but was repulsed by late September.^[159] Despite
   several offensives by both sides, by 1940 the war between China and
   Japan was at a stalemate. To increase pressure on China by blocking
   supply routes, and to better position Japanese forces in the event of a
   war with the Western powers, Japan invaded and occupied northern
   Indochina in September 1940.^[160]

   Chinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive in
   early 1940. In August, Chinese communists launched an offensive in
   Central China; in retaliation, Japan instituted harsh measures in
   occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the
   communists.^[161] Continued antipathy between Chinese communist and
   nationalist forces culminated in armed clashes in January 1941,
   effectively ending their co-operation.^[162] In March, the Japanese
   11th army attacked the headquarters of the Chinese 19th army but was
   repulsed during Battle of Shanggao.^[163]^[unreliable source?] In
   September, Japan attempted to take the city of Changsha again and
   clashed with Chinese nationalist forces.^[164]^[unreliable source?]

   German successes in Europe prompted Japan to increase pressure on
   European governments in Southeast Asia. The Dutch government agreed to
   provide Japan with oil supplies from the Dutch East Indies, but
   negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure
   in June 1941.^[165] In July 1941 Japan sent troops to southern
   Indochina, thus threatening British and Dutch possessions in the Far
   East. The United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western
   governments reacted to this move with a freeze on Japanese assets and a
   total oil embargo.^[166]^[167] At the same time, Japan was planning an
   invasion of the Soviet Far East, intending to take advantage of the
   German invasion in the west, but abandoned the operation after the
   sanctions.^[168]

   Since early 1941, the United States and Japan had been engaged in
   negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end
   the war in China. During these negotiations, Japan advanced a number of
   proposals which were dismissed by the Americans as inadequate.^[169] At
   the same time the United States, the United Kingdom, and the
   Netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of
   their territories, in the event of a Japanese attack against any of
   them.^[170] Roosevelt reinforced the Philippines (an American
   protectorate scheduled for independence in 1946) and warned Japan that
   the United States would react to Japanese attacks against any
   "neighboring countries".^[170]
   [220px-The_USS_Arizona_%28BB-39%29_burning_after_the_Japanese_attack_on

   loss in the Japanese surprise air attack on the American Pacific Fleet
   at Pearl Harbor, Sunday 7 December 1941.

   Frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the
   American–British–Dutch sanctions, Japan prepared for war. Emperor
   Hirohito, after initial hesitation about Japan's chances of
   victory,^[171] began to favour Japan's entry into the war.^[172] As a
   result, Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe resigned.^[173]^[174] Hirohito
   refused the recommendation to appoint Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni in
   his place, choosing War Minister Hideki Tojo instead.^[175] On 3
   November, Nagano explained in detail the plan of the attack on Pearl
   Harbor to the Emperor.^[176] On 5 November, Hirohito approved in
   imperial conference the operations plan for the war.^[177] On 20
   November, the new government presented an interim proposal as its final
   offer. It called for the end of American aid to China and for lifting
   the embargo on the supply of oil and other resources to Japan. In
   exchange, Japan promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia
   and to withdraw its forces from southern Indochina.^[169] The American
   counter-proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of
   China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all
   Pacific powers.^[178] That meant Japan was essentially forced to choose
   between abandoning its ambitions in China, or seizing the natural
   resources it needed in the Dutch East Indies by force;^[179]^[180] the
   Japanese military did not consider the former an option, and many
   officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of
   war.^[181]

   Japan planned to seize European colonies in Asia to create a large
   defensive perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific. The Japanese
   would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while
   exhausting the over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive
   war.^[182]^[183] To prevent American intervention while securing the
   perimeter, it was further planned to neutralise the United States
   Pacific Fleet and the American military presence in the Philippines
   from the outset.^[184] On 7 December 1941 (8 December in Asian time
   zones), Japan attacked British and American holdings with
   near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central
   Pacific.^[185] These included an attack on the American fleets at Pearl
   Harbor and the Philippines, as well as invasions of Guam, Wake Island,
   Malaya,^[185] Thailand, and Hong Kong.^[186]

   These attacks led the United States, United Kingdom, China, Australia,
   and several other states to formally declare war on Japan, whereas the
   Soviet Union, being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with
   European Axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement with
   Japan.^[187] Germany, followed by the other Axis states, declared war
   on the United States^[188] in solidarity with Japan, citing as
   justification the American attacks on German war vessels that had been
   ordered by Roosevelt.^[135]^[189] The Japanese invasion of Thailand led
   to Thailand's decision to ally itself with Japan.

    Axis advance stalls (1942–1943)

   On 1 January 1942, the Allied Big Four^[190]—the Soviet Union, China,
   the United Kingdom, and the United States—and 22 smaller or exiled
   governments issued the Declaration by United Nations, thereby affirming
   the Atlantic Charter^[191] and agreeing not to sign a separate peace
   with the Axis powers.^[192]

   During 1942, Allied officials debated on the appropriate grand strategy
   to pursue. All agreed that defeating Germany was the primary objective.
   The Americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on Germany
   through France. The Soviets demanded a second front. The British argued
   that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out
   German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolstering
   resistance forces; Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing
   campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily
   by Allied armour, without using large-scale armies.^[193] Eventually,
   the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was
   infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the Axis
   out of North Africa.^[194]

   At the Casablanca Conference in early 1943, the Allies reiterated the
   statements issued in the 1942 Declaration and demanded the
   unconditional surrender of their enemies. The British and Americans
   agreed to continue to press the initiative in the Mediterranean by
   invading Sicily to fully secure the Mediterranean supply routes.^[195]
   Although the British argued for further operations in the Balkans to
   bring Turkey into the war, in May 1943, the Americans extracted a
   British commitment to limit Allied operations in the Mediterranean to
   an invasion of the Italian mainland, and to invade France in
   1944.^[196]

      Pacific (1942–1943)

   [310px-Second_world_war_asia_1937-1942_map_en6.png] Map of Japanese
   military advances through mid-1942

   By the end of April 1942, Japan and its ally Thailand had almost
   conquered Burma, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and Rabaul,
   inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of
   prisoners.^[197] Despite stubborn resistance by Filipino and U.S.
   forces, the Philippine Commonwealth was eventually captured in May
   1942, forcing its government into exile.^[198] On 16 April, in Burma,
   7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division
   during the Battle of Yenangyaung and rescued by the Chinese 38th
   Division.^[199] Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the
   South China Sea, Java Sea, and Indian Ocean,^[200] and bombed the
   Allied naval base at Darwin, Australia. In January 1942, the only
   Allied success against Japan was a Chinese victory at Changsha.^[201]
   These easy victories over the unprepared U.S. and European opponents
   left Japan overconfident, and overextended.^[202]

   In early May 1942, Japan initiated operations to capture Port Moresby
   by amphibious assault and thus sever communications and supply lines
   between the United States and Australia. The planned invasion was
   thwarted when an Allied task force, centred on two American fleet
   carriers, fought Japanese naval forces to a draw in the Battle of the
   Coral Sea.^[203] Japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier Doolittle
   Raid, was to seize Midway Atoll and lure American carriers into battle
   to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would also send forces to
   occupy the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.^[204] In mid-May, Japan started
   the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign in China, with the goal of inflicting
   retribution on the Chinese who aided the surviving American airmen in
   the Doolittle Raid by destroying Chinese air bases and fighting against
   the Chinese 23rd and 32nd Army Groups.^[205]^[206] In early June, Japan
   put its operations into action, but the Americans had broken Japanese
   naval codes in late May and were fully aware of the plans and order of
   battle, and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at Midway
   over the Imperial Japanese Navy.^[207]

   With its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result
   of the Midway battle, Japan attempted to capture Port Moresby by an
   overland campaign in the Territory of Papua.^[208] The Americans
   planned a counterattack against Japanese positions in the southern
   Solomon Islands, primarily Guadalcanal, as a first step towards
   capturing Rabaul, the main Japanese base in Southeast Asia.^[209]

   Both plans started in July, but by mid-September, the Battle for
   Guadalcanal took priority for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea
   were ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the northern
   part of the island, where they faced Australian and United States
   troops in the Battle of Buna–Gona.^[210] Guadalcanal soon became a
   focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships
   in the battle for Guadalcanal. By the start of 1943, the Japanese were
   defeated on the island and withdrew their troops.^[211] In Burma,
   Commonwealth forces mounted two operations. The first was a disastrous
   offensive into the Arakan region in late 1942 that forced a retreat
   back to India by May 1943.^[212] The second was the insertion of
   irregular forces behind Japanese frontlines in February which, by the
   end of April, had achieved mixed results.^[213]

      Eastern Front (1942–1943)

   Despite considerable losses, in early 1942 Germany and its allies
   stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia,
   keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous
   year.^[214] In May, the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the Kerch
   Peninsula and at Kharkov,^[215] and then in June 1942 launched their
   main summer offensive against southern Russia, to seize the oil fields
   of the Caucasus and occupy the Kuban steppe, while maintaining
   positions on the northern and central areas of the front. The Germans
   split Army Group South into two groups: Army Group A advanced to the
   lower Don River and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while Army Group
   B headed towards the Volga River. The Soviets decided to make their
   stand at Stalingrad on the Volga.^[216]

   By mid-November, the Germans had nearly taken Stalingrad in bitter
   street fighting. The Soviets began their second winter
   counter-offensive, starting with an encirclement of German forces at
   Stalingrad,^[217] and an assault on the Rzhev salient near Moscow,
   though the latter failed disastrously.^[218] By early February 1943,
   the German Army had taken tremendous losses; German troops at
   Stalingrad had been defeated,^[219] and the front-line had been pushed
   back beyond its position before the summer offensive. In mid-February,
   after the Soviet push had tapered off, the Germans launched another
   attack on Kharkov, creating a salient in their front line around the
   Soviet city of Kursk.^[220]

   Exploiting poor American naval command decisions, the German navy
   ravaged Allied shipping off the American Atlantic coast.^[221] By
   November 1941, Commonwealth forces had launched a counter-offensive in
   North Africa, Operation Crusader, and reclaimed all the gains the
   Germans and Italians had made.^[222] The Germans also launched a North
   African offensive in January, pushing the British back to positions at
   the Gazala line by early February,^[223] followed by a temporary lull
   in combat which Germany used to prepare for their upcoming
   offensives.^[224] Concerns that the Japanese might use bases in
   Vichy-held Madagascar caused the British to invade the island in early
   May 1942.^[225] An Axis offensive in Libya forced an Allied retreat
   deep inside Egypt until Axis forces were stopped at El Alamein.^[226]
   On the Continent, raids of Allied commandos on strategic targets,
   culminating in the failed Dieppe Raid,^[227] demonstrated the Western
   Allies' inability to launch an invasion of continental Europe without
   much better preparation, equipment, and operational
   security.^[228]^[page needed]

   In August 1942, the Allies succeeded in repelling a second attack
   against El Alamein^[229] and, at a high cost, managed to deliver
   desperately needed supplies to the besieged Malta.^[230] A few months
   later, the Allies commenced an attack of their own in Egypt, dislodging
   the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across Libya.^[231] This
   attack was followed up shortly after by Anglo-American landings in
   French North Africa, which resulted in the region joining the
   Allies.^[232] Hitler responded to the French colony's defection by
   ordering the occupation of Vichy France;^[232] although Vichy forces
   did not resist this violation of the armistice, they managed to scuttle
   their fleet to prevent its capture by German forces.^[232]^[233] Axis
   forces in Africa withdrew into Tunisia, which was conquered by the
   Allies in May 1943.^[232]^[234]

   In June 1943, the British and Americans began a strategic bombing
   campaign against Germany with a goal to disrupt the war economy, reduce
   morale, and "de-house" the civilian population.^[235] The firebombing
   of Hamburg was among the first attacks in this campaign, inflicting
   significant casualties and considerable losses on infrastructure of
   this important industrial centre.^[236]

    Allies gain momentum (1943–1944)

   Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, 1943

   After the Guadalcanal campaign, the Allies initiated several operations
   against Japan in the Pacific. In May 1943, Canadian and U.S. forces
   were sent to eliminate Japanese forces from the Aleutians.^[237] Soon
   after, the United States, with support from Australia, New Zealand and
   Pacific Islander forces, began major ground, sea and air operations to
   isolate Rabaul by capturing surrounding islands, and breach the
   Japanese Central Pacific perimeter at the Gilbert and Marshall
   Islands.^[238] By the end of March 1944, the Allies had completed both
   of these objectives and had also neutralised the major Japanese base at
   Truk in the Caroline Islands. In April, the Allies launched an
   operation to retake Western New Guinea.^[239]

   In the Soviet Union, both the Germans and the Soviets spent the spring
   and early summer of 1943 preparing for large offensives in central
   Russia. On 5 July 1943, Germany attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk
   Bulge. Within a week, German forces had exhausted themselves against
   the Soviets' well-constructed defences,^[240] and for the first time in
   the war, Hitler cancelled an operation before it had achieved tactical
   or operational success.^[241] This decision was partially affected by
   the Western Allies' invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July, which,
   combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and
   arrest of Mussolini later that month.^[242]

   On 12 July 1943, the Soviets launched their own counter-offensives,
   thereby dispelling any chance of German victory or even stalemate in
   the east. The Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German
   superiority,^[243] giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the
   Eastern Front.^[244]^[245] The Germans tried to stabilise their eastern
   front along the hastily fortified Panther–Wotan line, but the Soviets
   broke through it at Smolensk and the Lower Dnieper Offensive.^[246]

   On 3 September 1943, the Western Allies invaded the Italian mainland,
   following Italy's armistice with the Allies and the ensuing German
   occupation of Italy.^[247] Germany, with the help of fascists,
   responded to the armistice by disarming Italian forces that were in
   many places without superior orders, seizing military control of
   Italian areas,^[248] and creating a series of defensive lines.^[249]
   German special forces then rescued Mussolini, who then soon established
   a new client state in German-occupied Italy named the Italian Social
   Republic,^[250] causing an Italian civil war. The Western Allies fought
   through several lines until reaching the main German defensive line in
   mid-November.^[251]

   positions at the Battle of Kursk, July 1943

   German operations in the Atlantic also suffered. By May 1943, as Allied
   counter-measures became increasingly effective, the resulting sizeable
   German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic
   naval campaign.^[252] In November 1943, Franklin D. Roosevelt and
   Winston Churchill met with Chiang Kai-shek in Cairo and then with
   Joseph Stalin in Tehran.^[253] The former conference determined the
   post-war return of Japanese territory^[254] and the military planning
   for the Burma campaign,^[255] while the latter included agreement that
   the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet
   Union would declare war on Japan within three months of Germany's
   defeat.^[256]

   From November 1943, during the seven-week Battle of Changde, the
   Chinese awaited allied relief as they forced Japan to fight a costly
   war of attrition.^[257]^[258]^[259]^[unreliable source?] In January
   1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line
   at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio.^[260]

   On 27 January 1944, Soviet troops launched a major offensive that
   expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, thereby ending the
   most lethal siege in history.^[261] The following Soviet offensive was
   halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North
   aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This
   delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea
   region.^[262] By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea,
   largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into
   Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops.^[263] The Allied
   offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing
   several German divisions to retreat, Rome was captured on June 4.^[264]

   The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the
   Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against
   Allied positions in Assam, India,^[265] and soon besieged Commonwealth
   positions at Imphal and Kohima.^[266] In May 1944, British and Indian
   forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to
   Burma by July,^[266] and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma
   in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina.^[267] The second
   Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting
   forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture
   Allied airfields.^[268] By June, the Japanese had conquered the
   province of Henan and begun a new attack on Changsha.^[269]

    Allies close in (1944)

   [220px-Approaching_Omaha.jpg] American troops approaching Omaha Beach
   during the invasion of Normandy on D-Day, 6 June 1944

   On 6 June 1944 (commonly known as D-Day), after three years of Soviet
   pressure,^[270] the Western Allies invaded northern France. After
   reassigning several Allied divisions from Italy, they also attacked
   southern France.^[271] These landings were successful and led to the
   defeat of the German Army units in France. Paris was liberated on 25
   August by the local resistance assisted by the Free French Forces, both
   led by General Charles de Gaulle,^[272] and the Western Allies
   continued to push back German forces in western Europe during the
   latter part of the year. An attempt to advance into northern Germany
   spearheaded by a major airborne operation in the Netherlands
   failed.^[273] After that, the Western Allies slowly pushed into
   Germany, but failed to cross the Rur river. In Italy, the Allied
   advance slowed due to the last major German defensive line.^[274]

   On 22 June, the Soviets launched a strategic offensive in Belarus
   ("Operation Bagration") that nearly destroyed the German Army Group
   Centre.^[275] Soon after that, another Soviet strategic offensive
   forced German troops from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland. The
   Soviets formed the Polish Committee of National Liberation to control
   territory in Poland and combat the Polish Armia Krajowa; the Soviet Red
   Army remained in the Praga district on the other side of the Vistula
   and watched passively as the Germans quelled the Warsaw Uprising
   initiated by the Armia Krajowa.^[276] The national uprising in Slovakia
   was also quelled by the Germans.^[277] The Soviet Red Army's strategic
   offensive in eastern Romania cut off and destroyed the considerable
   German troops there and triggered a successful coup d'état in Romania
   and in Bulgaria, followed by those countries' shift to the Allied
   side.^[278]
   [220px-Douglas_MacArthur_lands_Leyte1.jpg] General Douglas MacArthur

   In September 1944, Soviet troops advanced into Yugoslavia and forced
   the rapid withdrawal of German Army Groups E and F in Greece, Albania
   and Yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off.^[279] By this point,
   the communist-led Partisans under Marshal Josip Broz Tito, who had led
   an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation
   since 1941, controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged
   in delaying efforts against German forces further south. In northern
   Serbia, the Soviet Red Army, with limited support from Bulgarian
   forces, assisted the Partisans in a joint liberation of the capital
   city of Belgrade on 20 October. A few days later, the Soviets launched
   a massive assault against German-occupied Hungary that lasted until the
   fall of Budapest in February 1945.^[280] Unlike impressive Soviet
   victories in the Balkans, bitter Finnish resistance to the Soviet
   offensive in the Karelian Isthmus denied the Soviets occupation of
   Finland and led to a Soviet-Finnish armistice on relatively mild
   conditions,^[281] although Finland was forced to fight their former
   German allies.^[282]

   By the start of July 1944, Commonwealth forces in Southeast Asia had
   repelled the Japanese sieges in Assam, pushing the Japanese back to the
   Chindwin River^[283] while the Chinese captured Myitkyina. In September
   1944, Chinese forces captured Mount Song and reopened the Burma
   Road.^[284] In China, the Japanese had more successes, having finally
   captured Changsha in mid-June and the city of Hengyang by early
   August.^[285] Soon after, they invaded the province of Guangxi, winning
   major engagements against Chinese forces at Guilin and Liuzhou by the
   end of November^[286] and successfully linking up their forces in China
   and Indochina by mid-December.^[287]

   In the Pacific, U.S. forces continued to push back the Japanese
   perimeter. In mid-June 1944, they began their offensive against the
   Mariana and Palau islands and decisively defeated Japanese forces in
   the Battle of the Philippine Sea. These defeats led to the resignation
   of the Japanese Prime Minister, Hideki Tojo, and provided the United
   States with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the
   Japanese home islands. In late October, American forces invaded the
   Filipino island of Leyte; soon after, Allied naval forces scored
   another large victory in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, one of the largest
   naval battles in history.^[288]

   [220px-Yalta_Conference_%28Churchill%2C_Roosevelt%2C_Stalin%29_%28B%26W
   %29.jpg] Yalta Conference held in February 1945, with Winston
   Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Joseph Stalin

   On 16 December 1944, Germany made a last attempt to split the Allies on
   the Western Front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch a
   massive counter-offensive in the Ardennes and along the French-German
   border, hoping to encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and
   prompt a political settlement after capturing their primary supply port
   at Antwerp.^[289] By 16 January 1945, this offensive had been repulsed
   with no strategic objectives fulfilled.^[289] In Italy, the Western
   Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line. In mid-January
   1945, the Red Army attacked in Poland, pushing from the Vistula to the
   Oder river in Germany, and overran East Prussia.^[290] On 4 February
   Soviet, British, and U.S. leaders met for the Yalta Conference. They
   agreed on the occupation of post-war Germany, and on when the Soviet
   Union would join the war against Japan.^[291]

   In February, the Soviets entered Silesia and Pomerania, while the
   Western Allies entered western Germany and closed to the Rhine river.
   By March, the Western Allies crossed the Rhine north and south of the
   Ruhr, encircling the German Army Group B.^[292] In early March, in an
   attempt to protect its last oil reserves in Hungary and to retake
   Budapest, Germany launched its last major offensive against Soviet
   troops near Lake Balaton. In two weeks, the offensive had been
   repulsed, the Soviets advanced to Vienna, and captured the city. In
   early April, Soviet troops captured Königsberg, while the Western
   Allies finally pushed forward in Italy and swept across western Germany
   capturing Hamburg and Nuremberg. American and Soviet forces met at the
   Elbe river on 25 April, leaving several unoccupied pockets in southern
   Germany and around Berlin.

   Soviet troops stormed and captured Berlin in late April.^[293] In
   Italy, German forces surrendered on 29 April. On 30 April, the
   Reichstag was captured, signalling the military defeat of Nazi
   Germany,^[294] and the Berlin garrison surrendered on 2 May.

   Major changes in leadership occurred on both sides during this period.
   On 12 April, President Roosevelt died and was succeeded by his vice
   president, Harry S. Truman. Benito Mussolini was killed by Italian
   partisans on 28 April.^[295] On 30 April, Hitler committed suicide in
   his headquarters, and he was succeeded by Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz and
   Joseph Goebbels. Total and unconditional surrender in Europe was signed
   on 7 and 8 May, to be effective by the end of 8 May.^[296] German Army
   Group Centre resisted in Prague until 11 May.^[297]

   In the Pacific theatre, American forces accompanied by the forces of
   the Philippine Commonwealth advanced in the Philippines, clearing Leyte
   by the end of April 1945. They landed on Luzon in January 1945 and
   recaptured Manila in March. Fighting continued on Luzon, Mindanao, and
   other islands of the Philippines until the end of the war.^[298]
   Meanwhile, the United States Army Air Forces launched a massive
   firebombing campaign of strategic cities in Japan in an effort to
   destroy Japanese war industry and civilian morale. A devastating
   bombing raid on Tokyo of 9–10 March was the deadliest conventional
   bombing raid in history.^[299]

   USS Missouri, 2 September 1945.

   In May 1945, Australian troops landed in Borneo, overrunning the
   oilfields there. British, American, and Chinese forces defeated the
   Japanese in northern Burma in March, and the British pushed on to reach
   Rangoon by 3 May.^[300] Chinese forces started a counterattack in the
   Battle of West Hunan that occurred between 6 April and 7 June 1945.
   American naval and amphibious forces also moved towards Japan, taking
   Iwo Jima by March, and Okinawa by the end of June.^[301] At the same
   time, a naval blockade by submarines was strangling Japan's economy and
   drastically reducing its ability to supply overseas forces.^[302]^[303]

   On 11 July, Allied leaders met in Potsdam, Germany. They confirmed
   earlier agreements about Germany,^[304] and the American, British and
   Chinese governments reiterated the demand for unconditional surrender
   of Japan, specifically stating that "the alternative for Japan is
   prompt and utter destruction".^[305] During this conference, the United
   Kingdom held its general election, and Clement Attlee replaced
   Churchill as Prime Minister.^[306]

   The call for unconditional surrender was rejected by the Japanese
   government, which believed it would be capable of negotiating for more
   favourable surrender terms.^[307] In early August, the United States
   dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
   Between the two bombings, the Soviets, pursuant to the Yalta agreement,
   declared war on Japan, invaded Japanese-held Manchuria and quickly
   defeated the Kwantung Army, which was the largest Japanese fighting
   force.^[308] These two events persuaded previously adamant Imperial
   Army leaders to accept surrender terms.^[309] The Red Army also
   captured the southern part of Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands. On
   the night of 9–10 August 1945, Emperor Hirohito announced his decision
   to accept the terms demanded by the Allies in the Potsdam
   Declaration.^[310] On 15 August, the Emperor communicated this decision
   to the Japanese people through a speech broadcast on the radio
   (Gyokuon-hōsō, literally "broadcast in the Emperor's voice").^[311] On
   15 August 1945, Japan surrendered, with the surrender documents finally
   signed at Tokyo Bay on the deck of the American battleship USS Missouri
   on 2 September 1945, ending the war.^[312]

   Main articles: Aftermath of World War II and Consequences of Nazism

   The Allies established occupation administrations in Austria and
   Germany, both initially divided between western and eastern occupation
   zones controlled by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union,
   respectively. However, their paths soon diverged. In Germany, the
   western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies
   and the Soviet Union officially ended in 1949, with the respective
   zones becoming separate countries, West Germany and East Germany.^[313]
   In Austria, however, occupation continued until 1955, when a joint
   settlement between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union permitted
   the reunification of Austria as a democratic state officially
   non-aligned with any political bloc (although in practice having better
   relations with the Western Allies). A denazification program in Germany
   led to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the Nuremberg trials
   and the removal of ex-Nazis from power, although this policy moved
   towards amnesty and re-integration of ex-Nazis into West German
   society.^[314]

   Germany lost a quarter of its pre-war (1937) territory. Among the
   eastern territories, Silesia, Neumark and most of Pomerania were taken
   over by Poland,^[315] and East Prussia was divided between Poland and
   the Soviet Union, followed by the expulsion to Germany of the nine
   million Germans from these provinces,^[316]^[317] as well as three
   million Germans from the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia. By the 1950s,
   one-fifth of West Germans were refugees from the east. The Soviet Union
   also took over the Polish provinces east of the Curzon Line,^[318] from
   which 2 million Poles were expelled;^[317]^[319] north-east
   Romania,^[320]^[321] parts of eastern Finland,^[322] and the Baltic
   states were annexed into the Soviet Union.^[323]^[324] Italy lost its
   monarchy, colonial empire and some European territories.^[325]

   In an effort to maintain world peace,^[326] the Allies formed the
   United Nations,^[327] which officially came into existence on 24
   October 1945,^[328] and adopted the Universal Declaration of Human
   Rights in 1948 as a common standard for all member nations.^[329] The
   great powers that were the victors of the war—France, China, the United
   Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States—became the permanent
   members of the UN's Security Council.^[330] The five permanent members
   remain so to the present, although there have been two seat changes,
   between the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China in
   1971, and between the Soviet Union and its successor state, the Russian
   Federation, following the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. The alliance
   between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union had begun to
   deteriorate even before the war was over.^[331]
   [220px-EasternBloc_BorderChange38-48.svg.png] Post-war border changes
   in Central Europe and creation of the Communist Eastern Bloc

   Besides Germany, the rest of Europe was also divided into Western and
   Soviet spheres of influence.^[332] Most eastern and central European
   countries fell into the Soviet sphere, which led to establishment of
   Communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the Soviet
   occupation authorities. As a result, East Germany,^[333] Poland,
   Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Albania^[334] became
   Soviet satellite states. Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully
   independent policy, causing tension with the Soviet Union.^[335] A
   Communist uprising in Greece was put down with Anglo-American support
   and the country remained aligned with the West.^[336]

   Post-war division of the world was formalised by two international
   military alliances, the United States-led NATO and the Soviet-led
   Warsaw Pact.^[337] The long period of political tensions and military
   competition between them—the Cold War—would be accompanied by an
   unprecedented arms race and number of proxy wars throughout the
   world.^[338]

   In Asia, the United States led the occupation of Japan and administered
   Japan's former islands in the Western Pacific, while the Soviets
   annexed South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands.^[339] Korea, formerly
   under Japanese colonial rule, was divided and occupied by the Soviet
   Union in the North and the United States in the South between 1945 and
   1948. Separate republics emerged on both sides of the 38th parallel in
   1948, each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of Korea,
   which led ultimately to the Korean War.^[340]

   In China, nationalist and communist forces resumed the civil war in
   June 1946. Communist forces were victorious and established the
   People's Republic of China on the mainland, while nationalist forces
   retreated to Taiwan in 1949.^[341] In the Middle East, the Arab
   rejection of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the
   creation of Israel marked the escalation of the Arab–Israeli conflict.
   While European powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial
   empires, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered
   this unsuccessful, leading to decolonisation.^[342]^[343]

   The global economy suffered heavily from the war, although
   participating nations were affected differently. The United States
   emerged much richer than any other nation, leading to a baby boom, and
   by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that
   of any of the other powers, and it dominated the world economy.^[344]
   The Allied occupational authorities pursued a policy of industrial
   disarmament in Western Germany from 1945 to 1948.^[345] Due to
   international trade interdependencies, this policy led to an economic
   stagnation in Europe and delayed European recovery from the war for
   several years.^[346]^[347]

   At the Bretton Woods Conference in July 1944, the Allied nations drew
   up an economic framework for the post-war world. The agreement created
   the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for
   Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which later became part of the
   World Bank Group. The Bretton Woods system lasted until 1973.^[348]
   Recovery began with the mid-1948 currency reform in Western Germany,
   and was sped up by the liberalisation of European economic policy that
   the U.S. Marshall Plan economic aid (1948–1951) both directly and
   indirectly caused.^[349]^[350] The post-1948 West German recovery has
   been called the German economic miracle.^[351] Italy also experienced
   an economic boom^[352] and the French economy rebounded.^[353] By
   contrast, the United Kingdom was in a state of economic ruin,^[354] and
   although receiving a quarter of the total Marshall Plan assistance,
   more than any other European country,^[355] it continued in relative
   economic decline for decades.^[356] The Soviet Union, despite enormous
   human and material losses, also experienced rapid increase in
   production in the immediate post-war era,^[357] having seized and
   transferred most of Germany's industrial plants and exacted war
   reparations from its satellite states.^[b]^[358] Japan recovered much
   later.^[359] China returned to its pre-war industrial production by
   1952.^[360]

   [400px-World_War_II_Casualties.svg.png] World War II deaths

   Estimates for the total number of casualties in the war vary, because
   many deaths went unrecorded.^[361] Most suggest that some 60 million
   people died in the war, including about 20 million military personnel
   and 40 million civilians.^[362]^[363]^[364]

   The Soviet Union alone lost around 27 million people during the
   war,^[365] including 8.7 million military and 19 million civilian
   deaths.^[366] A quarter of the total people in the Soviet Union were
   wounded or killed.^[367] Germany sustained 5.3 million military losses,
   mostly on the Eastern Front and during the final battles in
   Germany.^[368]

   An estimated 11^[369] to 17 million^[370] civilians died as a direct or
   as an indirect result of Hitler's racist policies, including mass
   killing of around 6 million Jews, along with Roma, homosexuals, at
   least 1.9 million ethnic Poles^[371]^[372] and millions of other Slavs
   (including Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians), and other ethnic and
   minority groups.^[373]^[370] Between 1941 and 1945, more than 200,000
   ethnic Serbs, along with gypsies and Jews, were persecuted and murdered
   by the Axis-aligned Croatian Ustaše in Yugoslavia.^[374] Concurrently,
   Muslims and Croats were persecuted and killed by Serb nationalist
   Chetniks,^[375] with an estimated 50,000–68,000 victims (of which
   41,000 were civilians).^[376] Also, more than 100,000 Poles were
   massacred by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army in the Volhynia massacres,
   between 1943 and 1945.^[377] At the same time, about 10,000–15,000
   Ukrainians were killed by the Polish Home Army and other Polish units,
   in reprisal attacks.^[378]
   [220px-Nanking_bodies_1937.jpg] Bodies of Chinese civilians killed by
   the Imperial Japanese Army during the Nanjing Massacre in December 1937

   In Asia and the Pacific, the number of people killed by Japanese troops
   remains contested. According to R.J. Rummel, the Japanese killed
   between 3 million and more than 10 million people, with the most
   probable case of almost 6,000,000 people.^[379] According to the
   British historian M. R. D. Foot, civilian deaths are between 10 million
   and 20 million, whereas Chinese military casualties (killed and
   wounded) are estimated to be over five million.^[380] Other estimates
   say that up to 30 million people, most of them civilians, were
   killed.^[381]^[382] The most infamous Japanese atrocity was the Nanjing
   Massacre, in which fifty to three hundred thousand Chinese civilians
   were raped and murdered.^[383] Mitsuyoshi Himeta reported that
   2.7 million casualties occurred during the Three Alls policy. General
   Yasuji Okamura implemented the policy in Hebei and Shandong.^[384]

   Axis forces employed biological and chemical weapons. The Imperial
   Japanese Army used a variety of such weapons during its invasion and
   occupation of China (see Unit 731)^[385]^[386] and in early conflicts
   against the Soviets.^[387] Both the Germans and the Japanese tested
   such weapons against civilians,^[388] and sometimes on prisoners of
   war.^[389]

   The Soviet Union was responsible for the Katyn massacre of 22,000
   Polish officers,^[390] and the imprisonment or execution of hundreds of
   thousands of political prisoners by the NKVD secret police, along with
   mass civilian deportations to Siberia, in the Baltic states and eastern
   Poland annexed by the Red Army.^[391] Soviet soldiers committed mass
   rapes in occupied territories, especially in Germany.^[392]^[393] The
   exact number of German women and girls raped by Soviet troops during
   the war and occupation is uncertain, but historians estimate their
   numbers are likely in the hundreds of thousands, and possibly as many
   as two million,^[394] while figures for women raped by German soldiers
   in the Soviet Union go as far as ten million.^[395]^[396]

   The mass bombing of cities in Europe and Asia has often been called a
   war crime, although no positive or specific customary international
   humanitarian law with respect to aerial warfare existed before or
   during World War II.^[397] The USAAF bombed a total of 67 Japanese
   cities, killing 393,000 civilians, including the atomic bombings of
   Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and destroying 65% of built-up areas.^[398]

  Genocide, concentration camps, and slave labour

   Nazi Germany, under the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler, was responsible
   for murdering about 6 million Jews in what is now known as the
   Holocaust. They also murdered an additional 4 million others who were
   deemed "unworthy of life" (including the disabled and mentally ill,
   Soviet prisoners of war, Romani, homosexuals, Freemasons, and Jehovah's
   Witnesses) as part of a program of deliberate extermination, in effect
   becoming a "genocidal state".^[399] Soviet POWs were kept in especially
   unbearable conditions, and 3.6 million Soviet POWs out of 5.7 million
   died in Nazi camps during the war.^[400]^[401] In addition to
   concentration camps, death camps were created in Nazi Germany to
   exterminate people on an industrial scale. Nazi Germany extensively
   used forced labourers; about 12 million Europeans from German-occupied
   countries were abducted and used as a slave work force in German
   industry, agriculture and war economy.^[402]
   [220px-Czeslawa_Kwoka_-_Brasse.jpg] Prisoner identity photograph of a
   Polish girl taken by the German SS in Auschwitz.^[403] Approximately
   230,000 children were held prisoner and used in forced labour and Nazi
   medical experiments.

   The Soviet Gulag became a de facto system of deadly camps during
   1942–43, when wartime privation and hunger caused numerous deaths of
   inmates,^[404] including foreign citizens of Poland and other countries
   occupied in 1939–40 by the Soviet Union, as well as Axis POWs.^[405] By
   the end of the war, most Soviet POWs liberated from Nazi camps and many
   repatriated civilians were detained in special filtration camps where
   they were subjected to NKVD evaluation, and 226,127 were sent to the
   Gulag as real or perceived Nazi collaborators.^[406]

   Japanese prisoner-of-war camps, many of which were used as labour
   camps, also had high death rates. The International Military Tribunal
   for the Far East found the death rate of Western prisoners was 27
   percent (for American POWs, 37 percent),^[407] seven times that of POWs
   under the Germans and Italians.^[408] While 37,583 prisoners from the
   UK, 28,500 from the Netherlands, and 14,473 from the United States were
   released after the surrender of Japan, the number of Chinese released
   was only 56.^[409]

   At least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and
   Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the East Asia
   Development Board, or Kōain, for work in mines and war industries.
   After 1942, the number reached 10 million.^[410] In Java, between 4 and
   10 million rōmusha (Japanese: "manual labourers"), were forced to work
   by the Japanese military. About 270,000 of these Javanese labourers
   were sent to other Japanese-held areas in Southeast Asia, and only
   52,000 were repatriated to Java.^[411]

   Imperial Japan, and Nazi plunder

   In Europe, occupation came under two forms. In Western, Northern, and
   Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the
   annexed portions of Czechoslovakia) Germany established economic
   policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichsmarks
   (27.8 billion U.S. dollars) by the end of the war; this figure does not
   include the plunder of industrial products, military equipment, raw
   materials and other goods.^[412] Thus, the income from occupied nations
   was over 40 percent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a
   figure which increased to nearly 40 percent of total German income as
   the war went on.^[413]

   In the East, the intended gains of Lebensraum were never attained as
   fluctuating front-lines and Soviet scorched earth policies denied
   resources to the German invaders.^[414] Unlike in the West, the Nazi
   racial policy encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered
   to be the "inferior people" of Slavic descent; most German advances
   were thus followed by mass atrocities and war crimes.^[415] The Nazis
   killed an estimated 2.77 million ethnic Poles during the war in
   addition to Polish-Jewish victims of the
   Holocaust.^[416]^[better source needed] Although resistance groups
   formed in most occupied territories, they did not significantly hamper
   German operations in either the East^[417] or the West^[418] until late
   1943.

   In Asia, Japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the
   Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, essentially a Japanese hegemony
   which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised
   peoples.^[419] Although Japanese forces were sometimes welcomed as
   liberators from European domination, Japanese war crimes frequently
   turned local public opinion against them.^[420] During Japan's initial
   conquest, it captured 4,000,000 barrels (640,000 m^3) of oil (~550,000
   tonnes) left behind by retreating Allied forces; and by 1943, was able
   to get production in the Dutch East Indies up to 50 million barrels
   (7,900,000 m^3) of oil (~6.8 million tonnes), 76 percent of its 1940
   output rate.^[420]

   Allies to Axis GDP ratio between 1938 and 1945

   In Europe, before the outbreak of the war, the Allies had significant
   advantages in both population and economics. In 1938, the Western
   Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and the British Dominions) had a
   30 percent larger population and a 30 percent higher gross domestic
   product than the European Axis powers (Germany and Italy); including
   colonies, the Allies had more than a 5:1 advantage in population and a
   nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP.^[421] In Asia at the same time, China had
   roughly six times the population of Japan but only an 89 percent higher
   GDP; this is reduced to three times the population and only a 38
   percent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included.^[421]

   The United States produced about two-thirds of all munitions used by
   the Allies in World War II, including warships, transports, warplanes,
   artillery, tanks, trucks, and ammunition.^[422] Though the Allies'
   economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the
   initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the
   decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union
   joined the Allies and the war evolved into one of attrition.^[423]
   While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often
   attributed^[by whom?] to the Allies having more access to natural
   resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to
   employ women in the labour force,^[424] Allied strategic bombing,^[425]
   and Germany's late shift to a war economy^[426] contributed
   significantly. Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight
   a protracted war, and had not equipped themselves to do so.^[427] To
   improve their production, Germany and Japan used millions of slave
   labourers;^[428] Germany used about 12 million people, mostly from
   Eastern Europe,^[402] while Japan used more than 18 million people in
   Far East Asia.^[410]^[411]

  Advances in technology and its application

   Main article: Technology during World War II

   Aircraft were used for reconnaissance, as fighters, bombers, and
   ground-support, and each role developed considerably. Innovations
   included airlift (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority
   supplies, equipment, and personnel);^[429] and strategic bombing (the
   bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the
   enemy's ability to wage war).^[430] Anti-aircraft weaponry also
   advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-to-air
   artillery, in particular the introduction of the proximity fuze. The
   use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and led to jets becoming standard
   in air forces worldwide.^[431]

   Advances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare, most
   notably with aircraft carriers and submarines. Although aeronautical
   warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war, actions
   at Taranto, Pearl Harbor, and the Coral Sea established the carrier as
   the dominant capital ship (in place of the
   battleship).^[432]^[433]^[434] In the Atlantic, escort carriers became
   a vital part of Allied convoys, increasing the effective protection
   radius and helping to close the Mid-Atlantic gap.^[435] Carriers were
   also more economical than battleships due to the relatively low cost of
   aircraft^[436] and because they are not required to be as heavily
   armoured.^[437] Submarines, which had proved to be an effective weapon
   during the First World War,^[438] were expected by all combatants to be
   important in the second. The British focused development on
   anti-submarine weaponry and tactics, such as sonar and convoys, while
   Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs
   such as the Type VII submarine and wolfpack
   tactics.^[439]^[better source needed] Gradually, improving Allied
   technologies such as the Leigh Light, Hedgehog, Squid, and homing
   torpedoes proved effective against German submarines.^[440]

   Land warfare changed from the static frontlines of trench warfare of
   World War I, which had relied on improved artillery that outmatched the
   speed of both infantry and cavalry, to increased mobility and combined
   arms. The tank, which had been used predominantly for infantry support
   in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon.^[441] In
   the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had
   been during World War I,^[442] and advances continued throughout the
   war with increases in speed, armour and firepower.^[443]^[444] At the
   start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by
   tanks with superior specifications.^[445] This idea was challenged by
   the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against
   armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat. This,
   along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements
   of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and
   France.^[441] Many means of destroying tanks, including indirect
   artillery, anti-tank guns (both towed and self-propelled), mines,
   short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were
   used.^[445] Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the
   backbone of all forces,^[446] and throughout the war, most infantry
   were equipped similarly to World War I.^[447] The portable machine gun
   spread, a notable example being the German MG 34, and various
   submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle
   settings.^[447] The assault rifle, a late war development incorporating
   many features of the rifle and submachine gun, became the standard
   post-war infantry weapon for most armed forces.^[448]

   Most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity
   and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by
   designing ciphering machines, the most well-known being the German
   Enigma machine.^[449] Development of SIGINT (signals intelligence) and
   cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption. Notable
   examples were the Allied decryption of Japanese naval codes^[450] and
   British Ultra, a pioneering method for decoding Enigma that benefited
   from information given to the United Kingdom by the Polish Cipher
   Bureau, which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the
   war.^[451] Another component of military intelligence was deception,
   which the Allies used to great effect in operations such as Mincemeat
   and Bodyguard.^[450]^[452]

   Other technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a
   result of, the war include the world's first programmable computers
   (Z3, Colossus, and ENIAC), guided missiles and modern rockets, the
   Manhattan Project's development of nuclear weapons, operations
   research, the development of artificial harbours, and oil pipelines
   under the English Channel.^[453] Penicillin was first developed,
   mass-produced, and used during the war.^[454]

Notes

    1. ^ While various other dates have been proposed as the date on which
       World War II began or ended, this is the period most frequently
       cited.
    2. ^ Reparations were exacted from East Germany, Hungary, Romania, and
       Bulgaria using Soviet-dominated joint enterprises. The USSR also
       instituted trading arrangements deliberately designed to favour the
       country. Moscow controlled the Communist parties that ruled the
       satellite states, and they followed orders from the Kremlin.
       Historian Mark Kramer concludes: "The net outflow of resources from
       eastern Europe to the Soviet Union was approximately $15 billion to
       $20 billion in the first decade after World War II, an amount
       roughly equal to the total aid provided by the United States to
       western Europe under the Marshall Plan."

       outposts which the Westerners had dominated for generations, taking
       absolutely for granted their racial and cultural superiority over
       their Asian subjects." Dower goes on to note that, before the
       horrors of Japanese occupation made themselves felt, many Asians
       responded favourably to the victories of the Imperial Japanese
       forces.

       of the homeland was highly unlikely to succeed. The key military
       factor causing this effect was the sea blockade, which crippled
       Japan's ability to produce and equip the forces necessary to
       execute its strategy. The most important factor accounting for the
       timing of surrender was the Soviet attack against Manchuria,
       largely because it persuaded previously adamant Army leaders that
       the homeland could not be defended.".

   The Russo-Ukrainian War^[c] is an ongoing international conflict
   between Russia and Ukraine, which began in February 2014.^[d] Following
   Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity, Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine and
   supported pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian military in
   the Donbas war. The first eight years of conflict also included naval
   incidents, cyberwarfare, and heightened political tensions. In February
   2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and began
   occupying more of the country.

   In early 2014, the Euromaidan protests led to the Revolution of Dignity
   and the ousting of Ukraine's pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych.
   Shortly after, pro-Russian unrest erupted in eastern and southern
   Ukraine. Simultaneously, unmarked Russian troops moved into Ukraine's
   Crimea and took over government buildings, strategic sites and
   infrastructure. Russia soon annexed Crimea after a highly disputed
   referendum. In April 2014, armed pro-Russian separatists seized
   government buildings in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region and proclaimed
   the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic
   (LPR) as independent states, starting the Donbas war. The separatists
   received considerable but covert support from Russia, and Ukrainian
   attempts to fully retake separatist-held areas failed. Although Russia
   denied involvement, Russian troops took part in the fighting. In
   February 2015, Russia and Ukraine signed the Minsk II agreements to end
   the conflict, but they were never fully implemented in the years that
   followed. The Donbas war settled into a violent but static conflict
   between Ukraine and the Russian and separatist forces, with many brief
   ceasefires but no lasting peace and few changes in territorial control.

   Beginning in 2021, Russia built up a large military presence near its
   border with Ukraine, including within neighbouring Belarus. Russian
   officials repeatedly denied plans to attack Ukraine. Russian president
   Vladimir Putin criticized the enlargement of NATO and demanded that
   Ukraine be barred from ever joining the military alliance. He also
   expressed irredentist views and questioned Ukraine's right to exist.
   Russia recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states in February
   2022. Putin announced a "special military operation" to "demilitarize
   and denazify" Ukraine, claiming Russia had no plans to occupy the
   country. Russian forces invaded Ukraine. The invasion was
   internationally condemned; many countries imposed sanctions against
   Russia and increased existing sanctions. Russia abandoned an attempt to
   take Kyiv in early April 2022 amid fierce resistance. From August,
   Ukrainian forces began recapturing territories in the north-east and
   south. In late September, Russia declared the annexation of four
   partially-occupied regions of Ukraine, which was internationally
   condemned. Russia spent the winter conducting inconclusive offensives
   in the Donbas, and in spring 2023 dug into positions ahead of another
   Ukrainian counteroffensive. The war has resulted in a refugee crisis
   and tens of thousands of deaths.

   Ukraine

  Independent Ukraine and the Orange Revolution

   Further information: Orange Revolution

   After the dissolution of the Soviet Union (USSR) in 1991, Ukraine and
   Russia maintained close ties. In 1994, Ukraine agreed to accede to the
   Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a
   non-nuclear-weapon state.^[4] Former Soviet nuclear weapons in Ukraine
   were removed and dismantled.^[5] In return, Russia, the United Kingdom,
   and the United States agreed to uphold the territorial integrity and
   political independence of Ukraine through the Budapest Memorandum on
   Security Assurances.^[6]^[7] In 1999, Russia was one of the signatories
   of the Charter for European Security, which "reaffirmed the inherent
   right of each and every participating State to be free to choose or
   change its security arrangements, including treaties of alliance, as
   they evolve."^[8] In the years after the dissolution of the USSR,
   several former Eastern Bloc countries joined NATO, partly in response
   to regional security threats involving Russia such as the 1993 Russian
   constitutional crisis, the War in Abkhazia (1992–1993) and the First
   Chechen War (1994–1996). Putin claimed Western powers broke promises
   not to let any Eastern European countries join.^[9]^[10]
   [220px-Morning_first_day_of_Orange_Revolution.jpg] Protesters in
   Independence Square in Kyiv during the Orange Revolution, November 2004

   The 2004 Ukrainian presidential election was controversial. During the
   election campaign, opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned
   by TCDD dioxin;^[11]^[12] he later accused Russia of involvement.^[13]
   In November, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych was declared the winner,
   despite allegations of vote-rigging by election observers.^[14] During
   a two-month period which became known as the Orange Revolution, large
   peaceful protests successfully challenged the outcome. After the
   Supreme Court of Ukraine annulled the initial result due to widespread
   electoral fraud, a second round re-run was held, bringing to power
   Yushchenko as president and Yulia Tymoshenko as prime minister, and
   leaving Yanukovych in opposition.^[15] The Orange Revolution is often
   grouped together with other early-21st century protest movements,
   particularly within the former USSR, known as colour revolutions.
   According to Anthony Cordesman, Russian military officers viewed such
   colour revolutions as attempts by the US and European states to
   destabilise neighbouring countries and undermine Russia's national
   security.^[16] Russian President Vladimir Putin accused organisers of
   the 2011–2013 Russian protests of being former advisors to Yushchenko,
   and described the protests as an attempt to transfer the Orange
   Revolution to Russia.^[17] Rallies in favour of Putin during this
   period were called "anti-Orange protests".^[18]

   At the 2008 Bucharest summit, Ukraine and Georgia sought to join NATO.
   The response among NATO members was divided; Western European countries
   opposed offering Membership Action Plans (MAP) in order to avoid
   antagonising Russia, while US President George W. Bush pushed for their
   admission.^[19] NATO ultimately refused to offer Ukraine and Georgia
   MAPs, but also issued a statement agreeing that "these countries will
   become members of NATO" at some point. Putin voiced strong opposition
   to Georgia and Ukraine's NATO membership bids.^[20] By January 2022,
   the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO remained remote.^[21]

   In 2009, Yanukovych announced his intent to again run for president in
   the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election,^[22] which he subsequently
   won.^[23] In November 2013, a wave of large, pro-European Union (EU)
   protests erupted in response to Yanukovych's sudden decision not to
   sign the EU–Ukraine Association Agreement, instead choosing closer ties
   to Russia and the Eurasian Economic Union. On 22 February 2013 the
   Ukrainian parliament had overwhelmingly approved of finalizing the
   agreement with the EU,^[24] subsequent to which Russia had put pressure
   on Ukraine to reject it using the threat of sanctions, with Kremlin
   adviser Sergei Glazyev pronouncing that if the agreement was signed
   Russia could not guarantee Ukraine's status as a state.^[25]^[26]

  Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and pro-Russian unrest

   Main articles: Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and 2014 pro-Russian
   unrest in Ukraine

   Following months of protests as part of the Euromaidan movement, on 21
   February 2014 Yanukovych and the leaders of the parliamentary
   opposition signed a settlement agreement that called for early
   elections. The following day, Yanukovych fled from the capital ahead of
   an impeachment vote that stripped him of his powers as
   president.^[27]^[28]^[29]^[30] On 23 February, the Rada adopted a bill
   to repeal the 2012 law which gave the Russian language an official
   status.^[31] The bill was not enacted;^[32] however, the proposal
   provoked negative reactions in the Russian-speaking regions of
   Ukraine,^[33] intensified by Russian media saying that the ethnic
   Russian population was in imminent danger.^[34]

   On 27 February, an interim government was established and early
   presidential elections were scheduled. The following day, Yanukovych
   resurfaced in Russia and in a press conference declared that he
   remained the acting president of Ukraine, just as Russia was beginning
   its overt military campaign in Crimea. Leaders of Russian-speaking
   eastern regions of Ukraine declared continuing loyalty to
   Yanukovych,^[28]^[35] causing the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine.

  Russian military bases in Crimea

   Main article: Political status of Crimea

   At the onset of the conflict, Russia had roughly 12,000 military
   personnel in the Black Sea Fleet,^[34] in several locations in the
   Crimean peninsula like Sevastopol, Kacha, Hvardiiske, Simferopol Raion,
   Sarych, and others. In 2005 a dispute broke out over control of the
   Sarych cape lighthouse near Yalta, and a number of other
   beacons.^[36]^[37] Russian presence was allowed by the basing and
   transit agreement with Ukraine. Under the agreements the Russian
   military in Crimea was constrained to a maximum of 25,000 troops; they
   were required to: respect the sovereignty of Ukraine, honor its
   legislation, not interfere in the internal affairs of the country, and
   show their "military identification cards" when crossing the
   international border.^[38] Early in the conflict, the agreement's
   sizeable troop limit allowed Russia to significantly reinforce its
   military presence under the plausible guise of security concerns,
   deploy special forces and other required capabilities to conduct the
   operation in Crimea.^[34]

   According to the original treaty on the division of the Soviet Black
   Sea Fleet signed in 1997, Russia was allowed to have its military bases
   in Crimea until 2017, after which it would evacuate all military units
   including its portion of the Black Sea Fleet out of the Autonomous
   Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol. On 21 April 2010, former Ukrainian
   president Viktor Yanukovych signed a new deal known as the Kharkiv
   Pact, to resolve the 2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute; it extended the
   stay to 2042 with an option to renew.^[39]

  Legality and declaration of war

   Further information: On conducting a special military operation

   No formal declaration of war has been issued in the ongoing
   Russo-Ukrainian War. When Putin announced the 2022 Russian invasion of
   Ukraine, he claimed to commence a "special military operation",
   side-stepping a formal declaration of war.^[40] The statement was,
   however, regarded as a declaration of war by the Ukrainian
   government^[41] and reported as such by many international news
   sources.^[42]^[43] While the Ukrainian parliament refers to Russia as a
   "terrorist state" in regard to its military actions in Ukraine,^[44] it
   has not issued a formal declaration of war on its behalf.

   The Russian invasion of Ukraine violated international law (including
   the Charter of the United Nations).^[52]^[53]^[54]^[55] The invasion
   has also been called a crime of aggression under international criminal
   law^[56] and under some countries' domestic criminal codes – including
   those of Ukraine and Russia – although procedural obstacles exist to
   prosecutions under these laws.^[57]^[58]

   troops blocking the Ukrainian military base in Perevalne

   On 20 February 2014, Russia began an annexation of
   Crimea.^[59]^[60]^[61]^[62] On 22 and 23 February, in the relative
   power vacuum immediately after the ousting of Yanukovych,^[63] Russian
   troops and special forces began moving into Crimea through
   Novorossiysk.^[61] On 27 February, Russian forces without insignias
   began their advance into the Crimean Peninsula.^[64] They took
   strategic positions and captured the Crimean Parliament, raising a
   Russian flag. Security checkpoints isolated the Crimean Peninsula from
   the rest of Ukraine and restricted movement within the
   territory.^[65]^[66]^[67]^[68]

   In the following days, Russian soldiers secured key airports and a
   communications center.^[69] Russian cyberattacks shut down websites
   associated with the Ukrainian government, news media, and social media.
   Cyberattacks also enabled Russian access to the mobile phones of
   Ukrainian officials and members of parliament, further disrupting
   communications.^[70]

   On 1 March, the Russian legislature approved the use of armed forces,
   leading to an influx of Russian troops and military hardware into the
   peninsula.^[69] In the following days, all remaining Ukrainian military
   bases and installations were surrounded and besieged, including the
   Southern Naval Base. After Russia formally annexed the peninsula on 18
   March, Ukrainian military bases and ships were stormed by Russian
   forces. On 24 March, Ukraine ordered troops to withdraw; by 30 March,
   all Ukrainian forces had left the peninsula.

   On 15 April, the Ukrainian parliament declared Crimea a territory
   temporarily occupied by Russia.^[71] After the annexation, the Russian
   government increased its military presence in the region and made

    Pro-Russia unrest

   Main article: 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine

   From late February 2014, demonstrations by pro-Russian and
   anti-government groups took place in major cities across the eastern
   and southern regions of Ukraine.^[76] The first protests across
   southern and eastern Ukraine were largely native expressions of
   discontent with the new Ukrainian government.^[76]^[77] Russian
   involvement at this stage was limited to voicing support for the
   demonstrations.^[77]^[78] Russia exploited this, however, launching a
   coordinated political and military campaign against Ukraine.^[77]^[79]
   Putin gave legitimacy to the separatists when he described the Donbas
   as part of "New Russia" (Novorossiya), and expressed bewilderment as to
   how the region had ever become part of Ukraine.^[80]

   Russia continued to marshal forces near Ukraine's eastern border in
   late March, reaching 30–40,000 troops by April.^[81]^[34] The
   deployment was used to threaten escalation and disrupt Ukraine's
   response.^[34] This threat forced Ukraine to divert forces to its
   borders instead of the conflict zone.^[34]

   Ukrainian authorities cracked down on the pro-Russian protests and
   arrested local separatist leaders in early March. Those leaders were
   replaced by people with ties to the Russian security services and
   interests in Russian businesses.^[82] By April 2014, Russian citizens
   had taken control of the separatist movement, supported by volunteers
   and materiel from Russia, including Chechen and Cossack
   fighters.^[83]^[84]^[85]^[86] According to Donetsk People's Republic
   (DPR) commander Igor Girkin, without this support in April, the
   movement would have dissipated, as it had in Kharkiv and Odesa.^[87]
   The separatist groups held disputed referendums in May,^[88]^[89]^[90]
   which were not recognised by Ukraine or any other UN member state.^[88]

    Armed conflict

   [220px-RU_and_UA_forces%2C_2014.04_%28April%29_-_EN_01.png] Ukrainian
   response to Russian activities in Donbas after seizure of Sloviansk on
   12 April. April–May 2014.

   In April, armed conflict began in eastern Ukraine between
   Russian-backed separatist forces and Ukraine. The separatists declared
   the People's Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. From 6 April, militants
   occupied government buildings in many cities and took control of border
   crossings to Russia, transport hubs, a broadcasting center, and other
   strategic infrastructure. On 12 April several armed groups took cities
   of Sloviansk, Kramatorsk and then Horlivka, Druzhkivka in subsequent
   days. They were led by people like retired Russian colonel Igor Girkin
   and lieutenant colonel Igor Bezler. Faced with continued expansion of
   separatist territorial control, on 15 April the interim Ukrainian
   government launched an "Anti-Terrorist Operation" (ATO); however,
   Ukrainian forces were poorly prepared and ill-positioned and the
   operation quickly stalled.^[91]

   By the end of April, Ukraine announced it had lost control of the
   provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk. It claimed to be on "full combat
   alert" against a possible Russian invasion and reinstated conscription
   to its armed forces.^[92] Through May, the Ukrainian campaign focused
   on containing the separatists by securing key positions around the ATO
   zone to position the military for a decisive offensive once Ukraine's
   national mobilization had completed.

   As conflict between the separatists and the Ukrainian government
   escalated in May, Russia began to employ a "hybrid approach", combining
   disinformation tactics, irregular fighters, regular Russian troops, and
   conventional military support.^[93]^[94]^[95] The First Battle of
   Donetsk Airport followed the Ukrainian presidential elections. It
   marked a turning point in conflict; it was the first battle between the
   separatists and the Ukrainian government that involved large numbers of
   Russian "volunteers".^[96]^[97]^: 15  According to Ukraine, at the
   height of the conflict in the summer of 2014, Russian paramilitaries
   made up between 15% and 80% of the combatants.^[85] From June Russia
   trickled in arms, armor, and munitions.

   On 17 July 2014, Russian-controlled forces shot down a passenger
   aircraft, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, as it was flying over eastern
   Ukraine.^[98] Investigations and the recovery of bodies began in the
   conflict zone as fighting continued.^[99]^[100]^[101]

   By the end of July, Ukrainian forces were pushing into cities, to cut
   off supply routes between the two, isolating Donetsk and attempting to
   restore control of the Russo-Ukrainian border. By 28 July, the
   strategic heights of Savur-Mohyla were under Ukrainian control, along
   with the town of Debaltseve, an important railroad hub.^[102] These
   operational successes of Ukrainian forces threatened the existence of
   the DPR and LPR statelets, prompting Russian cross-border shelling
   targeted at Ukrainian troops on their own soil, from mid-July
   onwards.^[103]

    August 2014 Russian invasion

   [220px-War_in_donbass.svg.png] June–August 2014 progression map

   After a series of military defeats and setbacks for the separatists,
   who united under the banner of "Novorossiya",^[104]^[105] Russia
   dispatched what it called a "humanitarian convoy" of trucks across the
   border in mid-August 2014. Ukraine called the move a "direct
   invasion".^[106] Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council
   reported that convoys were arriving almost daily in November (up to 9
   convoys on 30 November) and that their contents were mainly arms and
   ammunition. Strelkov claimed that in early August, Russian servicemen,
   supposedly on "vacation" from the army, began to arrive in
   Donbas.^[107]

   By August 2014, the Ukrainian "Anti-Terrorist Operation" shrank the
   territory under pro-Russian control, and approached the border.^[108]
   Igor Girkin urged Russian military intervention, and said that the
   combat inexperience of his irregular forces, along with recruitment
   difficulties amongst the local population, had caused the setbacks. He
   stated, "Losing this war on the territory that President Vladimir Putin
   personally named New Russia would threaten the Kremlin's power and,
   personally, the power of the president".^[109]

   In response to the deteriorating situation, Russia abandoned its hybrid
   approach, and began a conventional invasion on 25 August
   2014.^[108]^[110] On the following day, the Russian Defence Ministry
   said these soldiers had crossed the border "by
   accident".^[111]^[112]^[113] According to Nikolai Mitrokhin's
   estimates, by mid-August 2014 during the Battle of Ilovaisk, between
   20,000 and 25,000 troops were fighting in the Donbas on the separatist
   side, and only 40–45% were "locals".^[114]

   On 24 August 2014, Amvrosiivka was occupied by Russian
   paratroopers,^[115] supported by 250 armoured vehicles and artillery
   pieces.^[116] The same day, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko
   referred to the operation as Ukraine's "Patriotic War of 2014" and a
   war against external aggression.^[117]^[118] On 25 August, a column of
   Russian military vehicles was reported to have crossed into Ukraine
   near Novoazovsk on the Azov sea coast. It appeared headed towards
   Ukrainian-held Mariupol,^[119]^[120]^[121]^[122]^[123] in an area that
   had not seen pro-Russian presence for weeks.^[124] Russian forces
   captured Novoazovsk.^[125] and Russian soldiers began deporting
   Ukrainians who did not have an address registered within the
   town.^[126] Pro-Ukrainian anti-war protests took place in
   Mariupol.^[126]^[127] The UN Security Council called an emergency
   meeting.^[128]

   The Pskov-based 76th Guards Air Assault Division allegedly entered
   Ukrainian territory in August and engaged in a skirmish near Luhansk,
   suffering 80 dead. The Ukrainian Defence Ministry said that they had
   seized two of the unit's armoured vehicles near Luhansk, and reported
   destroying another three tanks and two armoured vehicles in other
   regions.^[129]^[130] The Russian government denied the skirmish took
   place,^[130] but on 18 August, the 76th was awarded the Order of
   Suvorov, one of Russia's highest awards, by Russian minister of defence
   Sergey Shoigu for the "successful completion of military missions" and
   "courage and heroism".^[130]

   The speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament and Russian state
   television channels acknowledged that Russian soldiers entered Ukraine,
   but referred to them as "volunteers".^[131] A reporter for Novaya
   Gazeta, an opposition newspaper in Russia, stated that the Russian
   military leadership paid soldiers to resign their commissions and fight
   in Ukraine in the early summer of 2014, and then began ordering
   soldiers into Ukraine.^[132] Russian opposition MP Lev Shlosberg made
   similar statements, although he said combatants from his country are
   "regular Russian troops", disguised as units of the DPR and LPR.^[133]

   In early September 2014, Russian state-owned television channels
   reported on the funerals of Russian soldiers who had died in Ukraine,
   but described them as "volunteers" fighting for the "Russian world".
   Valentina Matviyenko, a top United Russia politician, also praised
   "volunteers" fighting in "our fraternal nation".^[131] Russian state
   television for the first time showed the funeral of a soldier killed
   fighting in Ukraine.^[134]

   On 3 September, Poroshenko said he and Putin had reached a "permanent
   ceasefire" agreement.^[135] Russia denied this, denying that it was a
   party to the conflict, adding that "they only discussed how to settle
   the conflict".^[136]^[137] Poroshenko then recanted.^[138]^[139] On 5
   September Russia's Permanent OSCE Representative Andrey Kelin, said
   that it was natural that pro-Russian separatists "are going to
   liberate" Mariupol. Ukrainian forces stated that Russian intelligence
   groups had been spotted in the area. Kelin said 'there might be
   volunteers over there.'^[140] On 4 September 2014, a NATO officer said
   that several thousand regular Russian forces wereoperating in
   Ukraine.^[141]

   On 5 September 2014, the Minsk Protocol ceasefire agreement drew a line
   of demarcation between Ukraine and separatist-controlled portions of
   Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts.

   On 7 and 12 November, NATO officials reconfirmed the Russian presence,
   citing 32 tanks, 16 howitzer cannons and 30 trucks of troops entering
   the country.^[142] US general Philip M. Breedlove said "Russian tanks,
   Russian artillery, Russian air defence systems and Russian combat
   troops" had been sighted.^[74]^[143] NATO said it had seen an increase
   in Russian tanks, artillery pieces and other heavy military equipment
   in Ukraine and renewed its call for Moscow to withdraw its
   forces.^[144] The Chicago Council on Global Affairs stated that Russian
   separatists enjoyed technical advantages over the Ukrainian army since
   the large inflow of advanced military systems in mid-2014: effective
   anti-aircraft weapons ("Buk", MANPADS) suppressed Ukrainian air
   strikes, Russian drones provided intelligence, and Russian secure
   communications system disrupted Ukrainian communications intelligence.
   The Russian side employed electronic warfare systems that Ukraine
   lacked. Similar conclusions about the technical advantage of the
   Russian separatists were voiced by the Conflict Studies Research
   Centre.^[145] In the 12 November United Nations Security Council
   meeting, the United Kingdom's representative accused Russia of
   intentionally constraining OSCE observation missions' capabilities,
   pointing out that the observers were allowed to monitor only two
   kilometers of border, and drones deployed to extend their capabilities
   were jammed or shot down.^[146]^[non-primary source needed]

   Russian-backed separatist republics from eastern Ukraine to be

   In January 2015, Donetsk, Luhansk, and Mariupol represented the three
   battle fronts.^[148] Poroshenko described a dangerous escalation on 21
   January amid reports of more than 2,000 additional Russian troops, 200
   tanks and armed personnel carriers crossing the border. He abbreviated
   his visit to the World Economic Forum because of his concerns.^[149]

   A new package of measures to end the conflict, known as Minsk II, was
   agreed on 15 February 2015.^[150] On 18 February, Ukrainian forces
   withdrew from Debatlseve, in the last high-intensity battle of the
   Donbas war until 2022. In September 2015 the United Nations Human
   Rights Office estimated that 8000 casualties had resulted from the
   conflict.^[151]

   Further information: Timeline of the war in Donbas (2015), Timeline of
   the war in Donbas (2016), and Timeline of the war in Donbas (2017)

   After the Minsk agreements, the war settled into static trench warfare
   around the agreed line of contact, with few changes in territorial
   control. The conflict was marked by artillery duels, special forces
   operations, and trench warfare. Hostilities never ceased for a
   substantial period of time, but continued at a low level despite
   repeated attempts at ceasefire. In the months after the fall of
   Debaltseve, minor skirmishes continued along the line of contact, but
   no territorial changes occurred. Both sides began fortifying their
   position by building networks of trenches, bunkers and tunnels, turning
   the conflict into static trench warfare.^[152]^[153] The relatively
   static conflict was labelled a "frozen" by some,^[154] but Russia never
   achieved this as the fighting never stopped.^[155]^[156] Between 2014
   and 2022 there were 29 ceasefires, each agreed to remain in force
   indefinitely. However, none of them lasted more than two weeks.^[157]

   US and international officials continued to report the active presence
   of Russian military in eastern Ukraine, including in the Debaltseve
   area.^[158] In 2015, Russian separatist forces were estimated to number
   around 36,000 troops (compared to 34,000 Ukrainian), of whom
   8,500–10,000 were Russian soldiers. Additionally, around 1,000 GRU
   troops were operating in the area.^[159] Another 2015 estimate held
   that Ukrainian forces outnumbered Russian forces 40,000 to
   20,000.^[160] In 2017, on average one Ukrainian soldier died in combat
   every three days,^[161] with an estimated 6,000 Russian and 40,000
   separatist troops in the region.^[162]^[163]

   Casualties of the war in Donbas

   Cases of killed and wounded Russian soldiers were discussed in local
   Russian media.^[164] Recruiting for Donbas was performed openly via
   veteran and paramilitary organisations. Vladimir Yefimov, leader of one
   such organisation, explained how the process worked in the Ural area.
   The organisation recruited mostly army veterans, but also policemen,
   firefighters etc. with military experience. The cost of equipping one
   volunteer was estimated at 350,000 rubles (around $6500) plus salary of
   60,000 to 240,000 rubles per month.^[165] The recruits received weapons
   only after arriving in the conflict zone. Often, Russian troops
   traveled disguised as Red Cross personnel.^[166]^[167]^[168]^[169] Igor
   Trunov, head of the Russian Red Cross in Moscow, condemned these
   convoys, saying they complicated humanitarian aid delivery.^[170]
   Russia refused to allow OSCE to expand its mission beyond two border
   crossings.^[171]

   The volunteers were issued a document claiming that their participation
   was limited to "offering humanitarian help" to avoid Russian mercenary
   laws. Russia's anti-mercenary legislation defined a mercenary as
   someone who "takes part [in fighting] with aims counter to the
   interests of the Russian Federation".^[165]

   In August 2016, the Ukrainian intelligence service, the SBU, published
   telephone intercepts from 2014 of Sergey Glazyev (Russian presidential
   adviser), Konstantin Zatulin, and other people in which they discussed
   covert funding of pro-Russian activists in Eastern Ukraine, the
   occupation of administration buildings and other actions that triggered
   the conflict.^[172] As early as February 2014, Glazyev gave direct
   instructions to various pro-Russian parties on how to take over local
   administration offices, what to do afterwards, how to formulate
   demands, and promised support from Russia, including "sending our
   guys".^[173]^[174]^[175]

   From March to April 2021, Russia commenced a major military build-up
   near the border, followed by a second build-up between October 2021 to
   February 2022 in Russia and Belarus.^[188] Throughout, the Russian
   government repeatedly denied it had plans to attack
   Ukraine.^[189]^[190]

   In early December 2021, following Russian denials, the US released
   intelligence of Russian invasion plans, including satellite photographs
   showing Russian troops and equipment near the border.^[191] The
   intelligence reported a Russian list of key sites and individuals to be
   killed or neutralized.^[192] The US released multiple reports that

   minister Olha Stefanishyna with NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg
   at a conference on 10 January 2022 regarding a potential Russian
   invasion

   In the months preceding the invasion, Russian officials accused Ukraine
   of inciting tensions, Russophobia, and repressing Russian speakers.
   They made multiple security demands of Ukraine, NATO, and other EU
   countries. On 9 December 2021 Putin said that "Russophobia is a first
   step towards genocide".^[193]^[194] Putin's claims were dismissed by
   the international community,^[195] and Russian claims of genocide were
   rejected as baseless.^[196]^[197]^[198] In a 21 February speech,^[199]
   Putin questioned the legitimacy of the Ukrainian state, repeating an
   inaccurate claim that "Ukraine never had a tradition of genuine
   statehood".^[200] He incorrectly stated that Vladimir Lenin had created
   Ukraine, by carving a separate Soviet Republic out of what Putin said
   was Russian land, and that Nikita Khrushchev "took Crimea away from
   Russia for some reason and gave it to Ukraine" in 1954.^[201]

   Putin falsely claimed that Ukrainian society and government were
   dominated by neo-Nazism, invoking the history of collaboration in
   German-occupied Ukraine during World War II,^[202]^[203] and echoing an
   antisemitic conspiracy theory that cast Russian Christians, rather than
   Jews, as the true victims of Nazi Germany.^[204]^[195] Ukraine does
   have a far-right fringe, including the neo-Nazi linked Azov Battalion
   and Right Sector.^[205]^[203] Analysts described Putin's rhetoric as
   greatly exaggerated.^[206]^[202] Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, stated that
   his grandfather served in the Soviet army fighting against the
   Nazis;^[207] three of his family members were killed in the
   Holocaust.^[206]

   100–200 kilometres (62–124 mi) from the Ukrainian border, with an
   assessment this could be increased to 175,000 personnel. Published by
   The Washington Post.^[208]

   During the second build-up, Russia demanded a treaty that would forbid
   Ukraine from ever joining NATO, and end all NATO activity in its
   Eastern European member states.^[209] These demands were
   rejected.^[210] A treaty to prevent Ukraine joining NATO would go
   against the alliance's "open door" policy and the principle of
   self-determination, although NATO made no efforts to comply with
   Ukraine's requests to join.^[211] NATO Secretary General Jens
   Stoltenberg replied that "Russia has no say" on whether Ukraine joins,
   and that "Russia has no right to establish a sphere of influence to try
   to control their neighbors".^[212] NATO offered to improve
   communications with Russia and discuss missile placements and military
   exercises, as long as Russia withdrew troops from Ukraine's
   borders,^[213] but Russia did not withdraw.

    Prelude to full invasion

   Fighting in Donbas escalated significantly from 17 February 2022
   onwards.^[214] The Ukrainians and the pro-Russian separatists each
   accused the other of attacks.^[215]^[216] There was a sharp increase in
   artillery shelling by the Russian-led militants in Donbas, which was
   considered by Ukraine and its supporters to be an attempt to provoke
   the Ukrainian army or create a pretext for invasion.^[217]^[218]^[219]
   On 18 February, the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics ordered
   mandatory emergency evacuations of civilians from their respective
   capital cities,^[220]^[221]^[222] although observers noted that full
   evacuations would take months.^[223] The Russian government intensified
   its disinformation campaign, with Russian state media promoting
   fabricated videos (false flags) on a nearly hourly basis purporting to
   show Ukrainian forces attacking Russia.^[224] Many of the
   disinformation videos were amateurish, and evidence showed that the
   claimed attacks, explosions, and evacuations in Donbas were staged by
   Russia.^[224]^[225]^[226]

   On 21 February at 22:35 (UTC+3),^[227] Putin announced that the Russian
   government would diplomatically recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk
   people's republics.^[228] The same evening, Putin directed that Russian
   troops deploy into Donbas, in what Russia referred to as a
   "peacekeeping mission".^[229]^[230] On 22 February, the Federation
   Council unanimously authorised Putin to use military force outside
   Russia.^[231] In response, Zelenskyy ordered the conscription of army
   reservists;^[232] The following day, Ukraine's parliament proclaimed a
   30-day nationwide state of emergency and ordered the mobilisation of
   all reservists.^[233]^[234]^[235] Russia began to evacuate its embassy
   in Kyiv.^[236]

   On the night of 23 February,^[237] Zelenskyy gave a speech in Russian
   in which he appealed to the citizens of Russia to prevent
   war.^[238]^[239] He rejected Russia's claims about neo-Nazis and stated
   that he had no intention of attacking the Donbas.^[240] Kremlin
   spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on 23 February that the separatist leaders
   in Donetsk and Luhansk had sent a letter to Putin stating that
   Ukrainian shelling had caused civilian deaths and appealing for
   military support.^[241]

   The Russian invasion of Ukraine began on the morning of 24 February
   2022,^[242] when Putin announced a "special military operation" to
   "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine.^[243]^[244] Minutes later,
   missiles and airstrikes hit across Ukraine, including Kyiv, shortly
   followed by a large ground invasion along multiple fronts.^[245]^[246]
   Zelenskyy declared martial law and a general mobilisation of all male
   Ukrainian citizens between 18 and 60, who were banned from leaving the
   country.^[247]^[248]

   Russian attacks were initially launched on a northern front from
   Belarus towards Kyiv, a southern front from Crimea, and a south-eastern
   front from Luhansk and Donetsk and towards Kharkiv.^[249]^[250] In the
   northern front, amidst heavy losses and strong Ukrainian resistance
   surrounding Kyiv, Russia's advance stalled in March, and by April its
   troops retreated. On 8 April, Russia placed its forces in southern and
   eastern Ukraine under the command of General Aleksandr Dvornikov, and
   some units withdrawn from the north were redeployed to the
   Donbas.^[251] On 19 April, Russia launched a renewed attack across a
   500 kilometres (300 mi) long front extending from Kharkiv to Donetsk
   and Luhansk.^[252] By 13 May, a Ukraine counter-offensive had driven
   back Russian forces near Kharkiv. By 20 May, Mariupol fell to Russian
   troops following a prolonged siege of the Azovstal steel
   works.^[253]^[254] Russian forces continued to bomb both military and
   civilian targets far from the frontline.^[255]^[256] The war caused the
   largest refugee and humanitarian crisis within Europe since the
   Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s;^[257]^[258] the UN described it as the
   fastest-growing such crisis since World War II.^[259] In the first week
   of the invasion, the UN reported over a million refugees had fled
   Ukraine; this subsequently rose to over 7,405,590 by 24 September, a
   reduction from over eight million due to some refugees'
   return.^[260]^[261]
   [220px-thumbnail.jpg] Ukrainian soldiers killed in the Russo-Ukrainian
   War in 2022

   Ukrainian forces launched counteroffensives in the south in August, and
   in the northeast in September. On 30 September, Russia annexed four
   oblasts of Ukraine which it had partially conquered during the
   invasion.^[262] This annexation was generally unrecognized and
   condemned by the countries of the world.^[263] After Putin announced
   that he would begin conscription drawn from the 300,000 citizens with
   military training and potentially the pool of about 25 million Russians
   who could be eligible for conscription, one-way tickets out of the
   country nearly or completely sold out.^[264]^[265] The Ukrainian
   offensive in the northeast successfully recaptured the majority of
   Kharkiv Oblast in September. In the course of the southern
   counteroffensive, Ukraine retook the city of Kherson in November and
   Russian forces withdrew to the east bank of the Dnieper
   River.^[citation needed]

   The invasion was internationally condemned as a war of
   aggression.^[266]^[267] A United Nations General Assembly resolution
   demanded a full withdrawal of Russian forces, the International Court
   of Justice ordered Russia to suspend military operations and the
   Council of Europe expelled Russia. Many countries imposed new
   sanctions, which affected the economies of Russia and the world,^[268]
   and provided humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine.^[269] In
   September 2022, Putin signed a law that would punish anyone who resists
   conscription with a 10-year prison sentence^[270] resulting in an
   international push to allow asylum for Russians fleeing
   conscription.^[271]

   According to an estimate published by The New York Times, as of
   February 2023, the "number of Russian troops killed and wounded in
   Ukraine is approaching 200,000."^[272]

Human rights violations

   See also: Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War, Humanitarian situation
   during the war in Donbas, and Russian war crimes § Ukraine

   Violations of human rights and atrocity crimes have both occurred
   during the war. From 2014 to 2021, there were more than 3,000 civilian
   casualties, with most occurring in 2014 and 2015.^[273] The right of
   movement was impeded for the inhabitants of the conflict zone.^[274]
   Arbitrary detention was practiced by both sides in the first years of
   the conflict. It decreased after 2016 in government-held areas, while
   in the separatist-held ones it continued.^[275] Investigations into the
   abuses committed by both sides made little progress.^[276]^[277]

   Since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russian
   authorities and armed forces have committed multiple war crimes in the
   form of deliberate attacks against civilian targets,^[278]^[279]
   massacres of civilians, torture and rape of women and
   children,^[280]^[281] and indiscriminate attacks in densely populated
   areas. After the Russian withdrawal from areas north of Kyiv,
   overwhelming evidence of war crimes by Russian forces was discovered.
   In particular, in the town of Bucha, evidence emerged of a massacre of
   civilians perpetrated by Russian troops, including torture, mutilation,
   rape, looting and deliberate killings of civilians.^[282]^[283]^[284]
   the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (OHCHR) has
   documented the murder of at least 73 civilians – mostly men, but also
   women and children – in Bucha.^[285] More than 1,200 bodies of
   civilians were found in the Kyiv region after Russian forces withdrew,
   some of them summarily executed. There were reports of forced
   deportations of thousands of civilians, including children, to Russia,
   mainly from Russian-occupied Mariupol,^[286]^[287] as well as sexual
   violence, including cases of rape, sexual assault and gang rape,^[288]
   and deliberate killing of Ukrainian civilians by Russian forces.^[289]

   Ukrainian forces have also been accused of committing various war
   crimes, including mistreatment of detainees, though on a much smaller
   scale than Russian forces.^[290]^[291]

     Europe TTF natural gas

   Until 2014 Ukraine was the main transit route for Russian natural gas
   sold to Europe, which earned Ukraine about US$3 billion a year in
   transit fees, making it the country's most lucrative export
   service.^[295] Following Russia's launch of the Nord Stream pipeline,
   which bypasses Ukraine, gas transit volumes steadily decreased.^[295]
   Following the start of the Russo-Ukrainian War in February 2014, severe
   tensions extended to the gas sector.^[296]^[297] The subsequent
   outbreak of war in the Donbas region forced the suspension of a project
   to develop Ukraine's own shale gas reserves at the Yuzivska gas field,
   which had been planned as a way to reduce Ukrainian dependence on
   Russian gas imports.^[298] Eventually, the EU commissioner for energy
   Günther Oettinger was called in to broker a deal securing supplies to
   Ukraine and transit to the EU.^[299]

   An explosion damaged a Ukrainian portion of the Urengoy–Pomary–Uzhhorod
   pipeline in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast in May 2014. Ukrainian officials
   blamed Russian terrorists.^[300] Another section of the pipeline
   exploded in the Poltava Oblast on 17 June 2014, one day after Russia
   limited the supply of gas to Ukrainian customers due to non-payment.
   Ukraine's Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said the following day that
   the explosion had been caused by a bomb.^[301]

   In 2015, Russian state media reported that Russia planned to completely
   abandon gas supplies to Europe through Ukraine after 2018.^[302]^[303]
   Russia's state-owned energy giant Gazprom had already substantially
   reduced the volumes of gas transited across Ukraine, and expressed its
   intention to reduce the level further by means of
   transit-diversification pipelines (Turkish Stream, Nord Stream,
   etc.).^[304] Gazprom and Ukraine agreed to a five-year deal on Russian
   gas transit to Europe at the end of 2019.^[305]^[306]

   In 2020, the TurkStream natural gas pipeline running from Russia to
   Turkey changed the regional gas flows in South-East Europe by diverting
   the transit through Ukraine and the Trans Balkan Pipeline
   system.^[307]^[308]

   In May 2021, the Biden administration waived Trump's CAATSA sanctions
   on the company behind Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to
   Germany.^[309]^[310] Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said he was
   "surprised" and "disappointed" by Joe Biden's decision.^[311] In July
   2021, the U.S. urged Ukraine not to criticise a forthcoming agreement
   with Germany over the pipeline.^[312]^[313]

   In July 2021, Biden and German Chancellor Angela Merkel concluded a
   deal that the U.S. might trigger sanctions if Russia used Nord Stream
   as a "political weapon". The deal aimed to prevent Poland and Ukraine
   from being cut off from Russian gas supplies. Ukraine will get a
   $50 million loan for green technology until 2024 and Germany will set
   up a billion dollar fund to promote Ukraine's transition to green
   energy to compensate for the loss of the gas-transit fees. The contract
   for transiting Russian gas through Ukraine will be prolonged until
   2034, if the Russian government agrees.^[314]^[315]^[316]

   In August 2021, Zelenskyy warned that the Nord Stream 2 natural gas
   pipeline between Russia and Germany was "a dangerous weapon, not only
   for Ukraine but for the whole of Europe."^[317]^[318] In September
   2021, Ukraine's Naftogaz CEO Yuriy Vitrenko accused Russia of using
   natural gas as a "geopolitical weapon".^[319] Vitrenko stated that "A
   joint statement from the United States and Germany said that if the
   Kremlin used gas as a weapon, there would be an appropriate response.
   We are now waiting for the imposition of sanctions on a 100% subsidiary
   of Gazprom, the operator of Nord Stream 2."^[320]

  Hybrid warfare

   The Russo-Ukrainian conflict has also included elements of hybrid
   warfare using non-traditional means. Cyberwarfare has been used by
   Russia in operations including successful attacks on the Ukrainian
   power grid in December 2015 and in December 2016, which was the first
   successful cyber attack on a power grid,^[321] and the Mass hacker
   supply-chain attack in June 2017, which the US claimed was the largest
   known cyber attack.^[322] In retaliation, Ukrainian operations have
   included the Surkov Leaks in October 2016 which released 2,337 e-mails
   in relation to Russian plans for seizing Crimea from Ukraine and
   fomenting separatist unrest in Donbas.^[323] The Russian information
   war against Ukraine has been another front of hybrid warfare waged by
   Russia.

   A Russian fifth column in Ukraine has also been claimed to exist among
   the Party of Regions, the Communist Party, the Progressive Socialist
   Party and the Russian Orthodox Church.^[324]^[325]^[326]

   False stories have been used to provoke public outrage during the war.
   In April 2014, Russian news channels Russia-1 and NTV showed a man
   saying he was attacked by a fascist Ukrainian gang on one channel and
   on the other channel saying he was funding the training of right-wing
   anti-Russia radicals.^[328]^[329] A third segment portrayed the man as
   a neo-Nazi surgeon.^[330] In May 2014, Russia-1 aired a story about
   Ukrainian atrocities using footage of a 2012 Russian operation in North
   Caucasus.^[331] In the same month, the Russian news network Life
   presented a 2013 photograph of a wounded child in Syria as a victim of
   Ukrainian troops who had just retaken Donetsk International
   Airport.^[332]

   In June 2014, several Russian state news outlets reported that Ukraine
   was using white phosphorus using 2004 footage of white phosphorus being
   used by the United States in Iraq.^[331] In July 2014, Channel One
   Russia broadcast an interview with a woman who said that a 3-year-old
   boy who spoke Russian was crucified by Ukrainian nationalists in a
   fictitious square in Sloviansk that turned out to be
   false.^[333]^[334]^[329]^[331]

   In 2022, Russian state media told stories of genocide and mass graves
   full of ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine. One set of graves outside
   Luhansk was dug when intense fighting in 2014 cut off the electricity
   in the local morgue. Amnesty International investigated 2014 Russian
   claims of mass graves filled with hundreds of bodies and instead found
   isolated incidents of extrajudicial executions by both
   sides.^[335]^[336]^[337] The Russian censorship apparatus Roskomnadzor
   ordered the country's media to employ information only from Russian
   state sources or face fines and blocks,^[338] and ordered media and
   schools to describe the war as a "special military operation".^[339] On
   4 March 2022, Putin signed into law a bill introducing prison sentences
   of up to 15 years for those who publish "fake news" about the Russian
   military and its operations,^[340] leading to some media outlets to
   stop reporting on Ukraine.^[341] Russia's opposition politician Alexei
   Navalny said the "monstrosity of lies" in the Russian state media "is
   unimaginable. And, unfortunately, so is its persuasiveness for those
   who have no access to alternative information."^[342] He tweeted that
   "warmongers" among Russian state media personalities "should be treated
   as war criminals. From the editors-in-chief to the talk show hosts to
   the news editors, [they] should be sanctioned now and tried
   someday."^[343]

   Putin and Russian media have described the government of Ukraine as
   being led by neo-Nazis persecuting ethnic Russians who are in need of
   protection by Russia, despite Ukraine's President Zelenskyy being
   Jewish.^[344]^[345]^[336] According to journalist Natalia Antonova,
   "Russia's present-day war of aggression is refashioned by propaganda
   into a direct continuation of the legacy of the millions of Russian
   soldiers who died to stop" Nazi Germany in World War II.^[346]
   Ukraine's rejection of the adoption of Russia-initiated General
   Assembly resolutions on combating the glorification of Nazism, the
   latest iteration of which is General Assembly Resolution
   A/C.3/76/L.57/Rev.1 on Combating Glorification of Nazism, Neo-Nazism
   and other Practices that Contribute to Fueling Contemporary Forms of
   Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance,
   serve to present Ukraine as a pro-Nazi state, and indeed likely forms
   the basis for Russia's claims, with the only other state rejecting the
   adoption of the resolution being the US.^[347]^[348] The Deputy US
   Representative for ECOSOC describes such resolutions as "thinly veiled
   attempts to legitimize Russian disinformation campaigns denigrating
   neighboring nations and promoting the distorted Soviet narrative of
   much of contemporary European history, using the cynical guise of
   halting Nazi glorification".^[349]

   NAFO ('North Atlantic Fellas Organization'), a loose cadre of online
   'shitposters' vowing to fight Russian disinformation generally
   identified by cartoon Shiba Inu dogs in social media, gained notoriety
   after June 2022, in the wake of a Twitter quarrel with Russian diplomat
   Mikhail Ulyanov.^[350]

  Russia–NATO relations

   Main article: Russia–NATO relations

   In his speech justifying the invasion of Ukraine, Putin falsely claimed
   that NATO military infrastructure was being built up inside Ukraine and
   was a threat to Russia.^[351] Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov
   characterized the conflict as a proxy war started by NATO.^[352] He
   said: "We don't think we're at war with NATO ... Unfortunately, NATO
   believes it is at war with Russia".^[353] NATO says it is not at war
   with Russia; its official policy is that it does not seek
   confrontation, but rather its members support Ukraine in "its right to
   self-defense, as enshrined in the UN Charter".^[354] NATO and Russia
   had co-operated until Russia annexed Crimea.^[354] Former CIA director
   Leon Panetta told the ABC that the U.S. is 'without question' involved
   in a proxy war with Russia.^[355]

   Russian military aircraft flying over the Baltic and Black Seas often
   do not indicate their position or communicate with air traffic
   controllers, thus posing a potential risk to civilian airliners. NATO
   aircraft scrambled many times to track and intercept these aircraft
   near alliance airspace. The Russian aircraft intercepted never entered
   NATO airspace, and the interceptions were conducted in a safe and
   routine manner.^[356]

   of Crimea's drinking and irrigation water.^[357]

   Interim Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov accused Russia of
   "provoking a conflict" by backing the seizure of the Crimean parliament
   building and other government offices on the Crimean peninsula. He
   compared Russia's military actions to the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, when
   Russian troops occupied parts of the Republic of Georgia and the
   breakaway enclaves of Abkhazia and South Ossetia were established under
   the control of Russian-backed administrations. He called on Putin to
   withdraw Russian troops from Crimea and stated that Ukraine will
   "preserve its territory" and "defend its independence".^[358] On 1
   March, he warned, "Military intervention would be the beginning of war
   and the end of any relations between Ukraine and Russia."^[359] On 1
   March, Acting President Oleksandr Turchynov placed the Armed Forces of
   Ukraine on full alert and combat readiness.^[360]

   that began in April 2014.

   On 4 March 2014, the United States pledged $1 billion in aid to
   Ukraine.^[362] Russia's actions increased tensions in nearby countries
   historically within its sphere of influence, particularly the Baltic
   and Moldova. All have large Russian-speaking populations, and Russian
   troops are stationed in the breakaway Moldovan territory of
   Transnistria.^[363] Some devoted resources to increasing defensive
   capabilities,^[364] and many requested increased support from the U.S.
   and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which they had joined in
   recent years.^[363]^[364] The conflict "reinvigorated" NATO, which had
   been created to face the Soviet Union, but had devoted more resources
   to "expeditionary missions" in recent years.^[365]

   In addition to diplomatic support in its conflict with Russia, the U.S.
   provided Ukraine with US$1.5 billion in military aid during the
   2010s.^[366] In 2018 the U.S. House of Representatives passed a
   provision blocking any training of Azov Battalion of the Ukrainian
   National Guard by American forces. In previous years, between 2014 and
   2017, the U.S. House of Representatives passed amendments banning
   support of Azov, but due to pressure from the Pentagon, the amendments
   were quietly lifted.^[367]^[368]^[369]

   more than 10 percent, while the Russian ruble hit all-time lows against
   the US dollar and the Euro.^[372]^[373]^[374] The Russian central bank
   hiked interest rates and intervened in the foreign exchange markets to
   the tune of $12 billion^[clarification needed] to try to stabilize its
   currency.^[371] Prices for wheat and grain rose, with Ukraine being a
   major exporter of both crops.^[375]

   Later in March 2014, the reaction of the financial markets to the
   Crimea annexation was surprisingly mellow, with global financial
   markets rising immediately after the referendum held in Crimea, one
   explanation being that the sanctions were already priced in following
   the earlier Russian incursion.^[376] Other observers considered that
   the positive reaction of the global financial markets on Monday 17
   March 2014, after the announcement of sanctions against Russia by the
   EU and the US, revealed that these sanctions were too weak to hurt
   Russia.^[377] In early August 2014, the German DAX was down by 6
   percent for the year, and 11 percent since June, over concerns Russia,
   Germany's 13th biggest trade partner, would retaliate against

   A poll of the Crimean public in Russian-annexed Crimea was taken by the
   Ukrainian branch of Germany's biggest market research organization,
   GfK, on 16–22 January 2015. According to its results: "Eighty-two
   percent of those polled said they fully supported Crimea's inclusion in

   percent spoke out against it."^[380]^[381]^[382]

   A joint poll conducted by Levada and the Kyiv International Institute
   of Sociology from September to October 2020 found that in the breakaway
   regions controlled by the DPR/LPR, just over half of the respondents
   wanted to join Russia (either with or without some autonomous status)
   while less than one-tenth wanted independence and 12% wanted
   reintegration into Ukraine. It contrasted with respondents in
   Kyiv-controlled Donbas, where a vast majority felt the separatist
   regions should be returned to Ukraine.^[383] According to results from
   Levada in January 2022, roughly 70% of those in the breakaway regions
   said their territories should become part of the Russian
   Federation.^[384]

   Peace march in Moscow, 21 September 2014

   An August 2014 survey by the Levada Centre reported that only 13% of
   those Russians polled would support the Russian government in an open
   war with Ukraine.^[385] Street protests against the war in Ukraine
   arose in Russia. Notable protests first occurred in March^[386]^[387]
   and large protests occurred in September when "tens of thousands"
   protested the war in Ukraine with a peace march in downtown Moscow on
   Sunday, 21 September 2014, "under heavy police supervision".^[388]

   refugees in Kraków protest against the war, 6 March 2022

   In March 2022, a week after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 98% of
   Ukrainians – including 82% of ethnic Russians living in Ukraine – said
   they did not believe that any part of Ukraine was rightfully part of
   Russia, according to Lord Ashcroft's polls which did not include Crimea
   and the separatist-controlled part of Donbas. 97% of Ukrainians said
   they had an unfavourable view of Russian President Vladimir Putin, with
   a further 94% saying they had an unfavourable view of the Russian Armed
   Forces.^[389]

   At the end of 2021, 75% of Ukrainians said they had a positive attitude
   toward ordinary Russians, while in May 2022, 82% of Ukrainians said
   they had a negative attitude toward ordinary Russians.^[390]

    Russian public opinion

      Countries on Russia's "Unfriendly Countries List". The list includes
   countries that have imposed sanctions against Russia for its invasion
   of Ukraine.^[391]

   An April 2022 survey by the Levada Centre reported that approximately
   74% of the Russians polled supported the "special military operation"
   in Ukraine, suggesting that Russian public opinion has shifted
   considerably since 2014.^[392] According to some sources, a reason many
   Russians supported the "special military operation" has to do with the
   propaganda and disinformation.^[393]^[394] In addition, it has been
   suggested that some respondents did not want to answer pollsters'
   questions for fear of negative consequences.^[395]^[396] At the end of
   March, a poll conducted in Russia by the Levada Center concluded the
   following: When asked why they think the military operation is taking
   place, respondents said it was to protect and defend civilians, ethnic
   Russians or Russian speakers in Ukraine (43%), to prevent an attack on
   Russia (25%), to get rid of nationalists and "denazify" Ukraine (21%),
   and to incorporate Ukraine or the Donbas region into Russia
   (3%)."^[397] According to polls, the Russian President's rating rose
   from 71% on the eve of the invasion to 82% in March 2023.^[398]

    United States

   On 28 April 2022, US President Joe Biden asked Congress for an
   additional $33 billion to assist Ukraine, including $20 billion to
   provide weapons to Ukraine.^[399] On 5 May, Ukraine's Prime Minister
   Denys Shmyhal announced that Ukraine had received more than $12 billion
   worth of weapons and financial aid from Western countries since the
   start of Russia's invasion on 24 February.^[400] On 21 May 2022, the
   United States passed legislation providing $40 billion in new military
   and humanitarian foreign aid to Ukraine, marking a historically large
   commitment of funds.^[401]^[402] In August 2022, U.S. defense spending
   to counter the Russian war effort exceeded the first 5 years of war
   costs in Afghanistan. The Washington Post reported that new U.S.
   weapons delivered to the Ukrainian war front suggest a closer combat
   scenario with more casualties.^[403] The United States looks to build
   "enduring strength in Ukraine" with increased arms shipments and a
   record-breaking $3 billion military aid package.^[403]

    Russian military suppliers

   After expending large amounts of heavy weapons and munitions over
   months, the Russian Federation received combat drones, loitering
   munitions, and large amounts of artillery and from Iran, deliveries of
   tanks and other armoured vehicles from Belarus, and reportedly planned
   to trade for artillery ammunition from North Korea and ballistic
   missiles from Iran.^[404]^[405]^[406]^[407]^[408]

   The U.S. has accused China of providing Russia with technology it needs
   for high-tech weapons, allegations which China has denied. The U.S.
   sanctioned a Chinese firm for providing satellite imagery to Russian
   mercenary forces fighting in Ukraine.^[409]

   In March 2023, Western nations had pressed the United Arab Emirates to
   halt re-exports of goods to Russia which had military uses, amidst
   allegations that the Gulf country exported 158 drones to Russia in
   2022.^[410] In May 2023, the U.S. accused South Africa of supplying
   arms to Russia in a covert naval operation,^[411] allegations which
   have been denied by South African president Cyril Ramaphosa.^[412]

Notes

    1. ^ ^a ^b The Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's
       Republic were Russian-controlled puppet states that declared their
       independence from Ukraine in May 2014. In 2022 they received
       international recognition from each other, Russia, Syria and North
       Korea, and some other partially recognised states. On 30 September
       2022 Russia declared it had formally annexed both entities.
    2. ^ There remain "some contradictions and inherent problems"
       regarding the date on which the annexation began.^[413] Ukraine
       claims 20 February 2014 as "the beginning of the temporary
       occupation of Crimea and Sevastopol by Russia", citing the
       timeframe inscribed on the Russian medal "For the Return of
       Crimea",^[414] and in 2015 the Ukrainian parliament officially
       designated the date as such.^[415] On 20 February 2014, Vladimir
       Konstantinov who at that time was a chairman of the republican
       council of Crimea and representing the Party of Regions expressed
       his thoughts about secession of the region from Ukraine.^[416] On
       23 February 2014 the Russian ambassador to Ukraine Mikhail Zurabov
       was recalled to Moscow due to a "worsening of [the] situation in
       Ukraine". In early March 2015, President Putin stated in a Russian
       movie about the annexation of Crimea that he ordered the operation
       to "restore" Crimea to Russia following an all-night emergency
       meeting on 22–23 February 2014,^[413]^[417] and in 2018 the Russian
       Foreign Minister claimed that the earlier "start date" on the medal
       was due to a "technical misunderstanding".^[418]

    4. ^ Many countries have provided various levels of support to Ukraine
       short of becoming belligerents in the war, while Belarus has
       provided Russian forces territorial access for the 2022 invasion.

   The Israeli–Palestinian conflict is an ongoing military and political
   conflict in the Levant. Beginning in the mid-20th century, it is one of
   the world's longest continuing conflicts.^[3] Various attempts have
   been made to resolve the conflict as part of the Israeli–Palestinian
   peace process, alongside other efforts to resolve the broader
   Arab–Israeli conflict.^[4]^[5]^[6]^[7] Public declarations of the
   desire to see a Jewish homeland established in Palestine, including the
   First Zionist Congress of 1897 and the Balfour Declaration of 1917,
   created early tensions in the region after waves of Jewish immigration.
   Following World War I, the Mandate for Palestine included a binding
   obligation for the "establishment in Palestine of a national home for
   the Jewish people". Tensions grew into open sectarian conflict between
   Jews and Arabs.^[8]^[9] The 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for
   Palestine was never implemented and provoked the 1947–1949 Palestine
   War. The current Israeli-Palestinian status quo began following Israeli
   military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, known as the Palestinian
   territories, in the 1967 Six-Day War.

   Progress was made towards a two-state solution with the Oslo Accords of
   1993–1995. Final status issues include the status of Jerusalem, Israeli
   settlements, borders, security and water rights^[10] as well as
   Palestinian freedom of movement^[11] and the Palestinian right of
   return. The violence of the conflict in the region—rich in sites of
   historic, cultural, and religious interest worldwide—has been the
   subject of numerous international conferences dealing with historic
   rights, security issues, and human rights, and has been a factor
   limiting access to, and tourism in, areas that are highly
   contested.^[12] The majority of peace efforts have been centred around
   the two-state solution, which involves the establishment of an
   independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. Public support for a
   two-state solution, which formerly enjoyed support from both Israeli
   Jews and Palestinians,^[13]^[14]^[15] has dwindled in recent
   years.^[16]^[17]^[18]

   Within Israeli and Palestinian society, the conflict generates a wide
   variety of views and opinions, with some claiming that the violence
   perpetrated by the Israelis against the Palestinians is part of a
   genocide, while others claim Palestinians use worldwide terrorism to
   promote their interests. Since its inception, the conflict's casualties
   have not been restricted to combatants, with a large number of civilian
   fatalities on both sides. A minority of Jewish Israelis (32 percent)
   support a two-state solution with the Palestinians.^[19] Israeli Jews
   are divided along ideological lines, and many favor maintaining the
   status quo.^[17] Approximately 60 percent of Palestinians (77% in the
   Gaza Strip and 46% in the West Bank), support armed attacks against
   Israelis within Israel as a means of ending the occupation, while 70%
   believe that a two-state solution is no longer practical or possible as
   a result of the expansion of Israeli settlements.^[18] More than
   two-thirds of Israeli Jews say that if the West Bank were annexed by
   Israel, Palestinians resident there should not be permitted to
   vote.^[20] Mutual distrust and significant disagreements are deep over
   basic issues, as is the reciprocal skepticism about the other side's
   commitment to upholding obligations in an eventual bilateral
   agreement.^[21] Since 2006, the Palestinian side has been fractured by
   conflict between Fatah, the traditionally dominant party, and its later
   electoral challenger, Hamas,^[a] a militant Islamist group that gained
   control of the Gaza Strip.^[22] Attempts to remedy this have been
   repeated and continuing. Since 2019, the Israeli side has also been
   experiencing political upheaval, with four inconclusive legislative
   elections having been held over a span of two years.^[23]^[24] The
   latest round of peace negotiations began in July 2013 but were
   suspended in 2014. Since 2006, Hamas and Israel have fought five wars,
   the most recent in 2023.^[22]

   The two parties that engage in direct negotiation are the Israeli
   government and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Official
   negotiations are mediated by the Quartet on the Middle East, which
   consists of the United Nations, the United States, Russia, and the
   European Union. The Arab League, which has proposed the Arab Peace
   Initiative, is another important actor. Egypt, a founding member of the
   Arab League, has historically been a key participant in the
   Arab–Israeli conflict and related negotiations, more so since the
   Egypt–Israel peace treaty. Another key participant is Jordan, which
   annexed the West Bank in 1950 and held it until 1967, relinquishing its
   territorial claim over it to the Palestinians in 1988. An Israel–Jordan
   peace treaty was signed in 1994. The Jordanian royal family, the
   Hashemites, are responsible for custodianship over Muslim and Christian
   holy sites in Jerusalem.

   newspaper featuring a caricature on its 18 June 1936 edition showing
   Zionism as a crocodile under the protection of a British officer
   telling Palestinian Arabs: "don't be afraid!!! I will swallow you
   peacefully...".^[25]

   The Israeli–Palestinian conflict has its roots in the late 19th and
   early 20th centuries, with the birth of major nationalist movements
   among the Jews and among the Arabs, both geared towards attaining
   sovereignty for their people in the Middle East.^[26] The Balfour
   Declaration was a public statement issued by the British government in
   1917 during the First World War announcing support for the
   establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in
   Palestine.^[27] The collision between those two movements in southern
   Levant upon the emergence of Palestinian nationalism after the
   Franco-Syrian War in the 1920s escalated into the Sectarian conflict in
   Mandatory Palestine in 1930s and 1940s, and expanded into the wider
   Arab–Israeli conflict later on.^[28]

   The return of several hard-line Palestinian Arab nationalists, under
   the emerging leadership of Haj Amin al-Husseini, from Damascus to
   Mandatory Palestine marked the beginning of Palestinian Arab
   nationalist struggle towards establishment of a national home for Arabs
   of Palestine.^[29] Amin al-Husseini, the architect of the Palestinian
   Arab national movement, immediately marked Jewish national movement and
   Jewish immigration to Palestine as the sole enemy to his cause,^[30]
   initiating large-scale riots against the Jews as early as 1920 in
   Jerusalem and in 1921 in Jaffa. Among the results of the violence was
   the establishment of the Jewish paramilitary force Haganah. In 1929, a
   series of violent riots resulted in the deaths of 133 Jews and 116
   Arabs, with significant Jewish casualties in Hebron and Safed, and the
   evacuation of Jews from Hebron and Gaza.^[26]
   [220px-Palest_against_british.gif] The Arab revolt of 1936–1939 in
   Palestine, motivated by opposition to mass Jewish immigration allowed
   by the British Mandate.

   In the early 1930s, the Arab national struggle in Palestine had drawn
   many Arab nationalist militants from across the Middle East, such as
   Sheikh Izaddin al-Qassam from Syria, who established the Black Hand
   militant group and had prepared the grounds for the 1936–1939 Arab
   revolt in Palestine. Following the death of al-Qassam at the hands of
   the British in late 1935, tensions erupted in 1936 into the Arab
   general strike and general boycott. The strike soon deteriorated into
   violence, and the Arab revolt was bloodily repressed by the British
   assisted by associated forces of the Jewish Settlement Police, the
   Jewish Supernumerary Police, and Special Night Squads.^[28] In the
   first wave of organized violence, lasting until early 1937, most of the
   Arab groups were defeated by the British, and forced expulsion of much
   of the Arab leadership ensued. The revolt led to the establishment of
   the Peel Commission towards partitioning of Palestine, though it was
   subsequently rejected by the Palestinian Arabs. The two main Jewish
   leaders, Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion, accepted the
   recommendations but some secondary Jewish leaders disapproved of
   it.^[31]^[32]^[33]

   The renewed violence, which continued sporadically until the beginning
   of World War II, ended with around 5,000 casualties, mostly from the
   Arab side. With the eruption of World War II, the situation in
   Mandatory Palestine calmed down. It allowed a shift towards a more
   moderate stance among Palestinian Arabs under the leadership of the
   Nashashibi clan and even the establishment of the Jewish–Arab Palestine
   Regiment under British command, fighting Germans in North Africa. The
   more radical exiled faction of al-Husseini, however, tended to
   cooperate with Nazi Germany, and participated in the establishment of a
   pro-Nazi propaganda machine throughout the Arab world. The defeat of
   Arab nationalists in Iraq and subsequent relocation of al-Husseini to
   Nazi-occupied Europe tied his hands regarding field operations in
   Palestine, though he regularly demanded that the Italians and the
   Germans bomb Tel Aviv. By the end of World War II, a crisis over the
   fate of the Holocaust survivors from Europe led to renewed tensions
   between the Yishuv and the Palestinian Arab leadership. Immigration
   quotas were established by the British, while on the other hand illegal
   immigration and Zionist insurgency against the British was
   increasing.^[26]
   [150px-Cia-is-map2.png] Land in the lighter shade represents territory
   within the borders of Israel at the conclusion of the 1948 war. This
   land is internationally recognized as belonging to Israel.

   On 29 November 1947, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted
   Resolution 181(II)^[34] recommending the adoption and implementation of
   a plan to partition Palestine into an Arab state, a Jewish state and
   the City of Jerusalem.^[35] On the next day, Palestine was swept by
   violence. For four months, under continuous Arab provocation and
   attack, the Yishuv was usually on the defensive while occasionally
   retaliating.^[36] The Arab League supported the Arab struggle by
   forming the volunteer-based Arab Liberation Army, supporting the
   Palestinian Arab Army of the Holy War, under the leadership of Abd
   al-Qadir al-Husayni and Hasan Salama. On the Jewish side, the civil war
   was managed by the major underground militias – the Haganah, Irgun and
   Lehi – strengthened by numerous Jewish veterans of World War II and
   foreign volunteers. By spring 1948, it was already clear that the Arab
   forces were nearing a total collapse, while Yishuv forces gained more
   and more territory, creating a large scale refugee problem of
   Palestinian Arabs.^[26]

  1948 Arab–Israeli War

   Main article: 1948 Arab-Israeli War

   Following the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel
   on 14 May 1948, the Arab League decided to intervene on behalf of
   Palestinian Arabs, marching their forces into former British Palestine,
   beginning the main phase of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.^[35] The overall
   fighting, leading to around 15,000 casualties, resulted in cease-fire
   and armistice agreements of 1949, with Israel holding much of the
   former Mandate territory, Jordan occupying and later annexing the West
   Bank and Egypt taking over the Gaza Strip, where the All-Palestine
   Government was declared by the Arab League on 22 September 1948.^[28]

  1956 Arab–Israeli War

   Main article: 1956 Suez Crisis

   Through the 1950s, Jordan and Egypt supported the Palestinian Fedayeen
   militants' cross-border attacks into Israel, while Israel carried out
   its own reprisal operations in the host countries. The 1956 Suez Crisis
   resulted in a short-term Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and exile
   of the All-Palestine Government, which was later restored with Israeli
   withdrawal. The All-Palestine Government was completely abandoned by
   Egypt in 1959 and was officially merged into the United Arab Republic,
   to the detriment of the Palestinian national movement. Gaza Strip then
   was put under the authority of the Egyptian military administrator,
   making it a de facto military occupation. In 1964, however, a new
   organization, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), was
   established by Yasser Arafat.^[35] It immediately won the support of
   most Arab League governments and was granted a seat in the Arab League.

  1967 Arab–Israeli War

   Main article: 1967 Six Day War

   [170px-6DayWarEnglish.png] During the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel
   captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights and the Sinai
   Peninsula. Each of these territories except the Sinai remain under
   Israeli occupation.

   The 1967 Six-Day War exerted a significant effect upon Palestinian
   nationalism, as Israel gained military control of the West Bank from
   Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt. Consequently, the PLO was unable
   to establish any control on the ground and established its headquarters
   in Jordan, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and supported
   the Jordanian army during the War of Attrition, which included the
   Battle of Karameh. However, the Palestinian base in Jordan collapsed
   with the Jordanian–Palestinian civil war in 1970. The PLO defeat by the
   Jordanians caused most of the Palestinian militants to relocate to
   South Lebanon, where they soon took over large areas, creating the
   so-called "Fatahland".

  1973 Arab–Israeli War

   Main article: Yom Kippur War

   On October 6, 1973, a coalition of Arab forces consisting of mainly
   Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack against Israel on the Jewish
   holy day of Yom Kippur. Egyptian and Syria had crossed over the
   ceasefire lines that were agreed upon prior to 1973. Egypt had in
   particular tried to reoccupy much of the area surrounding the Suez
   Canal, whilst the frontline with Syria was mainly situated around the
   north in the Golan Heights. The war concluded with an Israeli victory,
   with both sides suffering tremendous casualties.

  1982 Lebanon War

   Main article: 1982 Lebanon War

   Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon peaked in the early 1970s, as
   Lebanon was used as a base to launch attacks on northern Israel and
   airplane hijacking campaigns worldwide, which drew Israeli retaliation.
   During the Lebanese Civil War, Palestinian militants continued to
   launch attacks against Israel while also battling opponents within
   Lebanon. In 1978, the Coastal Road massacre led to the Israeli
   full-scale invasion known as Operation Litani. Israeli forces, however,
   quickly withdrew from Lebanon, and the attacks against Israel resumed.
   In 1982, following an assassination attempt on one of its diplomats by
   Palestinians, the Israeli government decided to take sides in the
   Lebanese Civil War and the 1982 Lebanon War commenced. The initial
   results for Israel were successful. Most Palestinian militants were
   defeated within several weeks, Beirut was captured, and the PLO
   headquarters were evacuated to Tunisia in June by Yasser Arafat's
   decision.^[28]

  First Intifada (1987–1993)

   Main article: First Intifada

   The first Palestinian uprising began in 1987 as a response to
   escalating attacks and the endless occupation. By the early 1990s,
   international efforts to settle the conflict had begun, in light of the
   success of the Egyptian–Israeli peace treaty of 1982. Eventually, the
   Israeli–Palestinian peace process led to the Oslo Accords of 1993,
   allowing the PLO to relocate from Tunisia and take ground in the West
   Bank and Gaza Strip, establishing the Palestinian National Authority.
   The peace process also had significant opposition among radical Islamic
   elements of Palestinian society, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic
   Jihad, who immediately initiated a campaign of attacks targeting
   Israelis. Following hundreds of casualties and a wave of radical
   anti-government propaganda, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin was
   assassinated by an Israeli far-right extremist who objected to the
   peace initiative. This struck a serious blow to the peace process, from
   which the newly elected government of Israel in 1996 backed off.^[26]

   Palestinian suicide bombing on a bus in Tel Aviv

   Following several years of unsuccessful negotiations, the conflict
   re-erupted as the Second Intifada in September 2000.^[28] The violence,
   escalating into an open conflict between the Palestinian National
   Security Forces and the Israel Defense Forces, lasted until 2004/2005
   and led to approximately 130 fatalities. In 2005, Israeli Prime
   Minister Sharon ordered the removal of Israeli settlers and soldiers
   from Gaza. Israel and its Supreme Court formally declared an end to
   occupation, saying it "had no effective control over what occurred" in
   Gaza.^[37] However, the United Nations, Human Rights Watch and many
   other international bodies and NGOs continue to consider Israel to be
   the occupying power of the Gaza Strip as Israel controls Gaza Strip's
   airspace, territorial waters and controls the movement of people or
   goods in or out of Gaza by air or sea.^[37]^[38]^[39]

  Fatah–Hamas split (2006–2007)

   In 2006, Hamas won a plurality of 44% in the Palestinian parliamentary
   election. Israel responded it would begin economic sanctions unless
   Hamas agreed to accept prior Israeli–Palestinian agreements, forswear
   violence, and recognize Israel's right to exist, all of which Hamas
   rejected.^[40] After internal Palestinian political struggle between
   Fatah and Hamas erupted into the Battle of Gaza (2007), Hamas took full
   control of the area.^[41] In 2007, Israel imposed a naval blockade on
   the Gaza Strip, and cooperation with Egypt allowed a ground blockade of
   the Egyptian border.

   The tensions between Israel and Hamas escalated until late 2008, when
   Israel launched operation Cast Lead upon Gaza, resulting in thousands
   of civilian casualties and billions of dollars in damage. By February
   2009, a ceasefire was signed with international mediation between the
   parties, though the occupation and small and sporadic eruptions of
   violence continued.^[citation needed]

   In 2011, a Palestinian Authority attempt to gain UN membership as a
   fully sovereign state failed. In Hamas-controlled Gaza, sporadic rocket
   attacks on Israel and Israeli air raids still take
   place.^[42]^[43]^[44]^[45] In November 2012, the representation of
   Palestine in UN was upgraded to a non-member observer State, and its
   mission title was changed from "Palestine (represented by PLO)" to
   "State of Palestine". In 2014, another war between Israel and Gaza
   occurred resulting in over 70 Israeli casualties and over 2000
   Palestinians casualties.

  Israeli far-right government (2022)

   In November 2022, with the election of the 37th government of Israel, a
   coalition government led by Benjamin Netanyahu and notable for its
   inclusion of far-right politicians,^[46] violence in the conflict
   increased, with events such as the January 2023 Jenin incursion, the
   June 2023 Jenin incursion, the July 2023 Jenin incursion, the 2023 Neve
   Yaakov shooting, the 2023 Al-Aqsa clashes, the May 2023 Gaza–Israel
   clashes, and the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, alongside Palestinian political
   violence has produced a death toll in 2023 that is the highest in the
   conflict since 2005.^[47]

Peace process

  Oslo Accords (1993, 1995)

   Main article: Oslo Accords

   [220px-Israel_and_Palestine_Peace.svg.png] A peace movement poster:
   Israeli and Palestinian flags and the word peace in Arabic and Hebrew.

   In 1993, Israeli officials led by Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leaders
   from the Palestine Liberation Organization led by Yasser Arafat strove
   to find a peaceful solution through what became known as the Oslo peace
   process. A crucial milestone in this process was Arafat's letter of
   recognition of Israel's right to exist. In 1993, the Oslo Accords were
   finalized as a framework for future Israeli–Palestinian relations. The
   crux of the Oslo agreement was that Israel would gradually cede control
   of the Palestinian territories over to the Palestinians in exchange for
   peace. The Oslo process was delicate and progressed in fits and starts.
   The process took a turning point at the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin
   in November 1995 and finally unraveled when Arafat and Ehud Barak
   failed to reach an agreement at Camp David in July 2000. Robert Malley,
   special assistant to US President Bill Clinton for Arab–Israeli
   Affairs, has confirmed that while Barak made no formal written offer to
   Arafat, the US did present concepts for peace which were considered by
   the Israeli side yet left unanswered by Arafat: "the Palestinians'
   principal failing is that from the beginning of the Camp David summit
   onward they were unable either to say yes to the American ideas or to
   present a cogent and specific counterproposal of their own".^[48]
   Consequently, there are different accounts of the proposals
   considered.^[49]^[50]^[51]

  Camp David Summit (2000)

   the Oslo Accords on 13 September 1993.

   In July 2000, US President Bill Clinton convened a peace summit between
   Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
   Barak. Barak reportedly put forward the following as "bases for
   negotiation", via the US to the Palestinian President: a
   non-militarized Palestinian state split into 3–4 parts containing
   87–92%^[en 1] of the West Bank including only parts of East Jerusalem,
   and the entire Gaza Strip,^[52]^[53] as well as a stipulation that 69
   Jewish settlements (which comprise 85% of the West Bank's Jewish
   settlers) would be ceded to Israel, no right of return to Israel, no
   sovereignty over the Temple Mount or any core East Jerusalem
   neighbourhoods, and continued Israel control over the Jordan
   Valley.^[54]^[55]

   Arafat rejected this offer.^[52]^[56]^[57]^[58]^[59]^[60] According to
   the Palestinian negotiators the offer did not remove many of the
   elements of the Israeli occupation regarding land, security,
   settlements, and Jerusalem.^[61] President Clinton reportedly requested
   that Arafat make a counter-offer, but he proposed none. Former Israeli
   Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben Ami who kept a diary of the negotiations
   said in an interview in 2001, when asked whether the Palestinians made
   a counterproposal: "No. And that is the heart of the matter. Never, in
   the negotiations between us and the Palestinians, was there a
   Palestinian counterproposal."^[62] In a separate interview in 2006 Ben
   Ami stated that were he a Palestinian he would have rejected the Camp
   David offer.^[63]

   No tenable solution was crafted which would satisfy both Israeli and
   Palestinian demands, even under intense US pressure. Clinton has long
   blamed Arafat for the collapse of the summit.^[64] In the months
   following the summit, Clinton appointed former US Senator George J.
   Mitchell to lead a fact-finding committee aiming to identify strategies
   for restoring the peace process. The committee's findings were
   published in 2001 with the dismantlement of existing Israeli
   settlements and Palestinian crackdown on militant activity being one
   strategy.^[65]

   Following the failed summit Palestinian and Israeli negotiators
   continued to meet in small groups through August and September 2000 to
   try to bridge the gaps between their respective positions. The United
   States prepared its own plan to resolve the outstanding issues.
   Clinton's presentation of the US proposals was delayed by the advent of
   the Second Intifada at the end of September.^[61]

   Clinton's plan, eventually presented on 23 December 2000, proposed the
   establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state in the Gaza strip and
   94–96 percent of the West Bank plus the equivalent of 1–3 percent of
   the West Bank in land swaps from pre-1967 Israel. On Jerusalem, the
   plan stated that "the general principle is that Arab areas are
   Palestinian and that Jewish areas are Israeli." The holy sites were to
   be split on the basis that Palestinians would have sovereignty over the
   Temple Mount/Noble sanctuary, while the Israelis would have sovereignty
   over the Western Wall. On refugees the plan suggested a number of
   proposals including financial compensation, the right of return to the
   Palestinian state, and Israeli acknowledgment of suffering caused to
   the Palestinians in 1948. Security proposals referred to a
   "non-militarized" Palestinian state, and an international force for
   border security. Both sides accepted Clinton's plan^[61]^[66]^[67] and
   it became the basis for the negotiations at the Taba Peace summit the
   following January.^[61]

  Taba Summit (2001)

   Main article: Taba Summit

   The Israeli negotiation team presented a new map at the Taba Summit in
   Taba, Egypt, in January 2001. The proposition removed the "temporarily
   Israeli controlled" areas, and the Palestinian side accepted this as a
   basis for further negotiation. With Israeli elections looming the talks
   ended without an agreement but the two sides issued a joint statement
   attesting to the progress they had made: "The sides declare that they
   have never been closer to reaching an agreement and it is thus our
   shared belief that the remaining gaps could be bridged with the
   resumption of negotiations following the Israeli elections." The
   following month the Likud party candidate Ariel Sharon defeated Ehud
   Barak in the Israeli elections and was elected as Israeli prime
   minister on 7 February 2001. Sharon's new government chose not to
   resume the high-level talks.^[61]

   One peace proposal, presented by the Quartet of the European Union,
   Russia, the United Nations and the United States on 17 September 2002,
   was the Road Map for Peace. This plan did not attempt to resolve
   difficult questions such as the fate of Jerusalem or Israeli
   settlements, but left that to be negotiated in later phases of the
   process. The proposal never made it beyond the first phase, whose goals
   called for a halt to both Israeli settlement construction and
   Israeli–Palestinian violence. Neither goal has been achieved as of
   November 2015.^[68]^[69]^[70]

  Arab Peace Initiative (2002, 2007, 2017)

   Main article: Arab Peace Initiative

   The Arab Peace Initiative (Arabic: مبادرة السلام العربية Mubādirat
   as-Salām al-ʿArabīyyah), also known as the Saudi Initiative, was first
   proposed by Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia at the Beirut Summit
   (2002). The peace initiative is a proposed solution to the Arab–Israeli
   conflict as a whole, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in
   particular.^[71] The initiative was initially published on 28 March
   2002, at the Beirut Summit, and agreed upon again in 2007 in the Riyadh
   Summit. Unlike the Road Map for Peace, it spelled out "final-solution"
   borders based explicitly on the UN borders established before the 1967
   Six-Day War. It offered full normalization of relations with Israel, in
   exchange for the withdrawal of its forces from all the occupied
   territories, including the Golan Heights, to recognize "an independent
   Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital" in the West Bank
   and Gaza Strip, as well as a "just solution" for the Palestinian
   refugees.^[72]

   The Palestinian Authority led by Yasser Arafat immediately embraced the
   initiative.^[73] His successor Mahmoud Abbas also supported the plan
   and officially asked U.S. President Barack Obama to adopt it as part of
   his Middle East policy.^[74] Islamist political party Hamas, the
   elected government of the Gaza Strip, was deeply divided,^[75] with
   most factions rejecting the plan.^[76] Palestinians have criticised the
   Israel–United Arab Emirates normalization agreement and another with
   Bahrain signed in September 2020, fearing the moves weaken the Arab
   Peace Initiative, regarding the UAE's move as "a betrayal."^[77]

   The Israeli government under Ariel Sharon rejected the initiative as a
   "non-starter"^[78] because it required Israel to withdraw to pre-June
   1967 borders.^[79] After the renewed Arab League endorsement in 2007,
   then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert gave a cautious welcome to the
   plan.^[80] In 2015, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed
   tentative support for the Initiative,^[81] but in 2018, he rejected it
   as a basis for future negotiations with the Palestinians.^[82]

Current status

   Main articles: Israeli–Palestinian peace process and Israel and
   apartheid

   The peace process has been predicated on a "two-state solution" thus
   far, but questions have been raised towards both sides' resolve to end
   the dispute.^[83] An article by S. Daniel Abraham, an American
   entrepreneur and founder of the Center for Middle East Peace in
   Washington, US, published on the website of the Atlantic magazine in
   March 2013, cited the following statistics: "Right now, the total
   number of Jews and Arabs living... in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza
   is just under 12 million people. At the moment, a shade under 50
   percent of the population is Jewish."^[84]

   In April 2021, Human Rights Watch released its report A Threshold
   Crossed, making accusations that the policies of Israel towards
   Palestinians living in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza constituted the
   crime of apartheid.^[85] A further report titled Israel's Apartheid
   Against Palestinians: Cruel System of Domination and Crime Against
   Humanity was released by Amnesty International on 1 February 2022.^[86]

  Israel's settlements policy

   [220px-SettlersShuhadaStreet.jpg] Israeli settlers in Hebron, West Bank

   Israel has had its settlement growth and policies in the Palestinian
   territories harshly criticized by the European Union citing it as
   increasingly undermining the viability of the two-state solution and
   running in contrary to the Israeli-stated commitment to resume
   negotiations.^[87]^[88] In December 2011, all the regional groupings on
   the UN Security Council named continued settlement construction and
   settler violence as disruptive to the resumption of talks, a call
   viewed by Russia as a "historic step".^[89]^[90]^[91] In April 2012,
   international outrage followed Israeli steps to further entrench the
   Jewish settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which
   included the publishing of tenders for further settler homes and the
   plan to legalize settler outposts. Britain said that the move was a
   breach of Israeli commitments under the road map to freeze all
   settlement expansion in the land captured since 1967. The British
   Foreign Minister stated that the "Systematic, illegal Israeli
   settlement activity poses the most significant and live threat to the
   viability of the two state solution".^[92] In May 2012 the 27 foreign
   ministers of the European Union issued a statement which condemned
   continued Israeli settler violence and incitement.^[93] In a similar
   move, the Quartet "expressed its concern over ongoing settler violence
   and incitement in the West Bank," calling on Israel "to take effective
   measures, including bringing the perpetrators of such acts to
   justice."^[94] The Palestinian Ma'an News agency reported the PA
   Cabinet's statement on the issue stated that the West, including East
   Jerusalem, were seeing "an escalation in incitement and settler
   violence against our people with a clear protection from the occupation
   military. The last of which was the thousands of settler march in East
   Jerusalem which included slogans inciting to kill, hate and supports
   violence".^[95]

   11 May 2022

   In a report published in February 2014 covering incidents over the
   three-year period of 2011–2013, Amnesty International asserted that
   Israeli forces employed reckless violence in the West Bank, and in some
   instances appeared to engage in wilful killings which would be
   tantamount to war crimes. Besides the numerous fatalities, Amnesty said
   at least 261 Palestinians, including 67 children, had been gravely
   injured by Israeli use of live ammunition. In this same period, 45
   Palestinians, including 6 children had been killed. Amnesty's review of
   25 civilians deaths concluded that in no case was there evidence of the
   Palestinians posing an imminent threat. At the same time, over 8,000
   Palestinians suffered serious injuries from other means, including
   rubber-coated metal bullets. Only one IDF soldier was convicted,
   killing a Palestinian attempting to enter Israel illegally. The soldier
   was demoted and given a 1-year sentence with a five-month suspension.
   The IDF answered the charges stating that its army held itself "to the
   highest of professional standards", adding that when there was
   suspicion of wrongdoing, it investigated and took action "where
   appropriate".^[96]^[97]

  Incitement

   Following the Oslo Accords, which was to set up regulative bodies to
   rein in frictions, Palestinian incitement against Israel, Jews, and
   Zionism continued, parallel with Israel's pursuance of settlements in
   the Palestinian territories,^[98] though under Abu Mazen it has
   reportedly dwindled significantly.^[99] Charges of incitement have been
   reciprocal,^[100]^[101] both sides interpreting media statements in the
   Palestinian and Israeli press as constituting incitement.^[99]
   Schoolbooks published for both Israeli and Palestinian schools have
   been found to have encouraged one-sided narrative and even hatred of
   the other side.^[102]^[103]^[104]^[105]^[106]^[107] Perpetrators of
   murderous attacks, whether against Israelis or Palestinians, often find
   strong vocal support from sections of their communities despite varying
   levels of condemnation from politicians.^[108]^[109]^[110]

   Both parties to the conflict have been criticized by third-parties for
   teaching incitement to their children by downplaying each side's
   historical ties to the area, teaching propagandist maps, or
   indoctrinate their children to one day join the armed
   forces.^[111]^[112]

   The PLO have campaigned for full member status for the state of
   Palestine at the UN and for recognition on the 1967 borders. The
   campaign has received widespread support,^[113]^[114] although it has
   been criticised by the US and Israel for allegedly avoiding bilateral
   negotiation.^[115]^[116] Netanyahu has criticized the Palestinians of
   purportedly trying to bypass direct talks,^[117] whereas Abbas has
   argued that the continued construction of Israeli-Jewish settlements is
   "undermining the realistic potential" for the two-state solution.^[118]
   Although Palestine has been denied full member status by the UN
   Security Council,^[119] in late 2012 the UN General Assembly
   overwhelmingly approved the de facto recognition of sovereign Palestine
   by granting non-member state status.^[120]

  Public attitudes towards peace

   Polling data has produced mixed results regarding the level of support
   among Palestinians for the two-state solution. A poll was carried out
   in 2011 by the Hebrew University; it indicated that support for a
   two-state solution was growing among both Israelis and Palestinians.
   The poll found that 58% of Israelis and 50% of Palestinians supported a
   two-state solution based on the Clinton Parameters, compared with 47%
   of Israelis and 39% of Palestinians in 2003, the first year the poll
   was carried out. The poll also found that an increasing percentage of
   both populations supported an end to violence—63% of Palestinians and
   70% of Israelis expressing their support for an end to violence, an
   increase of 2% for Israelis and 5% for Palestinians from the previous
   year.^[121]

Issues in dispute

   The following outlined positions are the official positions of the two
   parties; however, it is important to note that neither side holds a
   single position. Both the Israeli and the Palestinian sides include
   both moderate and extremist bodies as well as dovish and hawkish
   bodies.

   One of the primary obstacles to resolving the Israeli–Palestinian
   conflict is a deep-set and growing distrust between its participants.
   Unilateral strategies and the rhetoric of hardline political factions,
   coupled with violence and incitements by civilians against one another,
   have fostered mutual embitterment and hostility and a loss of faith in
   the peace process. Support among Palestinians for Hamas is
   considerable, and as its members consistently call for the destruction
   of Israel and violence remains a threat,^[122] security becomes a prime
   concern for many Israelis. The expansion of Israeli settlements in the
   West Bank has led the majority of Palestinians to believe that Israel
   is not committed to reaching an agreement, but rather to a pursuit of
   establishing permanent control over this territory in order to provide
   that security.^[123]

  Status of Jerusalem

   CIA regards as settlements, plus refugee camps, fences, and walls

   The control of Jerusalem is a particularly delicate issue, with each
   side asserting claims over the city. The three largest Abrahamic
   religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—hold Jerusalem as an
   important setting for their religious and historical narratives.
   Jerusalem is the holiest city for Judaism, being the former location of
   the Jewish temples on the Temple Mount and the capital of the ancient
   Israelite kingdom. For Muslims, Jerusalem is the third holiest site,
   being the location of Isra and Mi'raj event, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
   For Christians, Jerusalem is the site of Jesus' crucifixion and the
   Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

   The Israeli government, including the Knesset and Supreme Court, is
   located in the "new city" of West Jerusalem and has been since Israel's
   founding in 1948. After Israel captured the Jordanian-controlled East
   Jerusalem in the Six-Day War, it assumed complete administrative
   control of East Jerusalem. In 1980, Israel passed the Jerusalem Law
   declaring "Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of
   Israel."^[124]^[better source needed]

   Many countries do not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, with
   exceptions being the United States,^[125] and Russia.^[126] The
   majority of UN member states and most international organisations do
   not recognise Israel's claims to East Jerusalem which occurred after
   the 1967 Six-Day War, nor its 1980 Jerusalem Law proclamation.^[127]
   The International Court of Justice in its 2004 Advisory opinion on the
   "Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied
   Palestinian Territory" described East Jerusalem as "occupied
   Palestinian territory".^[128]

   At the Camp David and Taba Summits in 2000–2001, the United States
   proposed a plan in which the Arab parts of Jerusalem would be given to
   the proposed Palestinian state while the Jewish parts of Jerusalem were
   given to Israel. All archaeological work under the Temple Mount would
   be jointly controlled by the Israeli and Palestinian governments. Both
   sides accepted the proposal in principle, but the summits ultimately
   failed.^[129]

  Holy sites and Jerusalem's Temple Mount

   [250px-Klagemauer.JPG] Panorama of the Western Wall with the Dome of
   the Rock (left) and al-Aqsa mosque (right) in the background

   Israel has concerns regarding the welfare of Jewish holy places under
   possible Palestinian control. When Jerusalem was under Jordanian
   control, no Jews were allowed to visit the Western Wall or other Jewish
   holy places, and the Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives was
   desecrated.^[129] Since 1975, Israel has banned Muslims from worshiping
   at Joseph's Tomb, a shrine considered sacred by both Jews and Muslims.
   Settlers established a yeshiva, installed a Torah scroll and covered
   the mihrab. During the Second Intifada the site was looted and
   burned.^[130]^[131] Israeli security agencies routinely monitor and
   arrest Jewish extremists that plan attacks, though many serious
   incidents have still occurred.^[132] Israel has allowed almost complete
   autonomy to the Muslim trust (Waqf) over the Temple Mount.^[129]

   Palestinians have voiced concerns regarding the welfare of Christian
   and Muslim holy places under Israeli control.^[133] Additionally, some
   Palestinian advocates have made statements alleging that the Western
   Wall Tunnel was re-opened with the intent of causing the mosque's
   collapse.^[134]

  Palestinian refugees

   [170px-Woman_nakba_dress_jug.jpg] Palestinian refugees, 1948

   Palestinian refugees are people who lost both their homes and means of
   livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli conflict^[135] and the
   1967 Six-Day War.^[136] The number of Palestinians who fled or were
   expelled from Israel following its creation was estimated at 711,000 in
   1949.^[137] Descendants of these original Palestinian Refugees are also
   eligible for registration and services provided by the United Nations
   Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East
   (UNRWA), and as of 2010 number 4.7 million people.^[138] Between
   350,000 and 400,000 Palestinians were displaced during the 1967
   Arab–Israeli war.^[136] A third of the refugees live in recognized
   refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and the Gaza
   Strip. The remainder live in and around the cities and towns of these
   host countries.^[135]

   Most of these people were born outside Israel, but are descendants of
   original Palestinian refugees.^[135] Palestinian negotiators, such as
   Yasser Arafat, have so far publicly insisted that refugees have a right
   to return to the places where they lived before 1948 and 1967,
   including those within the 1949 Armistice lines, citing the Universal
   Declaration of Human Rights and UN General Assembly Resolution 194 as
   evidence. However, according to reports of private peace negotiations
   with Israel they have countenanced the return of only 10,000 refugees
   and their families to Israel as part of a peace settlement. Mahmoud
   Abbas, the current Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization
   was reported to have said in private discussion that it is "illogical
   to ask Israel to take 5 million, or indeed 1 million. That would mean
   the end of Israel."^[139] In a further interview Abbas stated that he
   no longer had an automatic right to return to Safed in the northern
   Galilee where he was born in 1935. He later clarified that the remark
   was his personal opinion and not official policy.^[140]

   Palestinian and international authors have justified the right of
   return of the Palestinian refugees on several
   grounds:^[141]^[142]^[143] Several scholars included in the broader New
   Historians argue that the Palestinian refugees fled or were chased out
   or expelled by the actions of the Haganah, Lehi and Irgun, Zionist
   paramilitary groups.^[144]^[145] A number have also characterized this
   as an ethnic cleansing.^[146]^[147]^[148]^[149] The New Historians cite
   indications of Arab leaders' desire for the Palestinian Arab population
   to stay put.^[150]

   The Israeli Law of Return that grants citizenship to people of Jewish
   descent is viewed by critics as discriminatory against other ethnic
   groups, especially Palestinians that cannot apply for such citizenship
   under the law of return, to the territory which they were expelled from
   or fled during the course of the 1948 war.^[151]^[152]^[153]

   According to the UN Resolution 194, adopted in 1948, "the refugees
   wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their
   neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable
   date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those
   choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property which,
   under principles of international law or in equity, should be made good
   by the Governments or authorities responsible."^[154] UN Resolution
   3236 "reaffirms also the inalienable right of the Palestinians to
   return to their homes and property from which they have been displaced
   and uprooted, and calls for their return".^[155] Resolution 242 from
   the UN affirms the necessity for "achieving a just settlement of the
   refugee problem"; however, Resolution 242 does not specify that the
   "just settlement" must or should be in the form of a literal
   Palestinian right of return.^[156]

   The most common arguments for opposition are:
    1. On the 18 August 1948, at the United Nations Security Council,
       Israel declared that it is not reasonable to contemplate a return
       of the refugees as the Arab League and the Arab High Committee have
       announced their intentions to continue their war of aggression and
       resume hostilities, noting that the state of war has not been
       lifted and that no peace treaty has been signed. However, Israel
       accepted the next year the return of some of the refugees, notably
       through the annexation of the Gaza Strip or by absorbing 100.000 of
       them in exchange of a peace treaty. The Arab countries refused the
       proposal, demanding a complete return.^[157]
    2. The Palestinian refugee issue is handled by a separate authority
       from that handling other refugees, that is, by UNRWA and not the
       UNHCR. Most of the people recognizing themselves as Palestinian
       refugees would have otherwise been assimilated into their country
       of current residency, and would not maintain their refugee state if
       not for the separate entities.^[158]
    3. Concerning the origin of the Palestinian refugees, the Israeli
       government said that during the 1948 War the Arab Higher Committee
       and the Arab states encouraged Palestinians to flee in order to
       make it easier to rout the Jewish state or that they did so to
       escape the fights by fear.^[citation needed] The Palestinian
       narrative is that refugees were largely expelled and dispossessed
       by Jewish militias and by the Israeli army.

   Historians still debate the causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus.
   Notably, historian Benny Morris states that most of Palestine's 700,000
   refugees fled because of the "flail of war" and expected to return home
   shortly after a successful Arab invasion. He documents instances in
   which Arab leaders advised the evacuation of entire communities as
   happened in Haifa. In his scholarly work, however, he does conclude
   that there were expulsions which were carried out.^[159]^[160] Morris
   considers the displacement the result of a national conflict initiated
   by the Arabs themselves.^[160] In a 2004 interview with Haaretz, he
   described the exodus as largely resulting from an atmosphere of
   transfer that was promoted by Ben-Gurion and understood by the military
   leadership. He also claimed that there "are circumstances in history
   that justify ethnic cleansing".^[161] He has been criticized by
   political scientist Norman Finkelstein for having seemingly changed his
   views for political, rather than historical, reasons.^[162]

   Since Jewish people who fled or otherwise emigrated from the Arab world
   after the Israeli declaration of independence were never compensated or
   repatriated by their former countries of residence—to no objection on
   the part of Arab leaders—a precedent has been set whereby it is the
   responsibility of the nation which accepts the refugees to assimilate
   them.^[163]^[164]^[165]
   [220px-Shatila_-_street_view_%282%29.jpg] Shatila refugee camp on the
   outskirts of Beirut in May 2019

   Although Israel accepts the right of the Palestinian Diaspora to return
   into a new Palestinian state, Israel insists that the return of this
   population into the current state of Israel would be a great danger for
   the stability of the Jewish state; an influx of Palestinian refugees
   would lead to the destruction of the state of Israel.^[166]

   According to Efraim Karsh the Palestinians were themselves the
   aggressors in the 1948–1949 war who attempted to "cleanse" a
   neighboring ethnic community. Had the United Nations resolution of 29
   November 1947 recommending partition in Palestine not been subverted by
   force by the Arab world, there would have been no refugee problem in
   the first place. He reports of large numbers of Palestinian refugees
   leaving even before the outbreak of the 1948 war because of
   disillusionment and economic privation. The British High Commissioner
   for Palestine spoke of the "collapsing Arab morale in Palestine" that
   he partially attributed to the "increasing tendency of those who should
   be leading them to leave the country" and the considerable evacuations
   of the Arab effendi class. Huge numbers of Palestinians were also
   expelled by their leadership to prevent them from becoming Israeli
   citizens and in Haifa and Tiberias, tens of thousands of Arabs were
   forcibly evacuated on the instructions of the Arab Higher
   Committee.^[167]

  Israeli security concerns

   Authority, Palestinian political violence, and 2010 Palestinian
   militancy campaign

   [220px-Terror_Strikes_Israeli_Civilians_in_Southern_Israel.jpg] Remains
   of an Egged bus hit by suicide bomber in the aftermath of the 2011
   southern Israel cross-border attacks. Eight people were killed, about
   40 were injured.

   Throughout the conflict, Palestinian violence has been a concern for
   Israelis. Israel,^[168] along with the United
   States^[169]^[better source needed] and the European Union, refer to
   the violence against Israeli civilians and military forces by
   Palestinian militants as terrorism. The motivations behind Palestinian
   violence against Israeli civilians are many, and not all violent
   Palestinian groups agree with each other on specifics. Nonetheless, a
   common motive is the desire to destroy Israel and replace it with a
   Palestinian Arab state.^[170] The most prominent Islamist groups, such
   as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, view the Israeli–Palestinian
   conflict as a religious jihad.^[171]

   Suicide bombings have been used as a tactic among Palestinian
   organizations like Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs
   Brigade and certain suicide attacks have received support among
   Palestinians as high as 84%.^[172]^[173] In Israel, Palestinian suicide
   bombers have targeted civilian buses, restaurants, shopping malls,
   hotels and marketplaces.^[174] From 1993 to 2003, 303 Palestinian
   suicide bombers attacked Israel.

   The Israeli government initiated the construction of a security barrier
   following scores of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks in July
   2003. Israel's coalition government approved the security barrier in
   the northern part of the green line between Israel and the West Bank.
   According to the IDF, since the erection of the fence, terrorist acts
   have declined by approximately 90%.^[175]

   Since 2001, the threat of Qassam rockets fired from Palestinian
   territories into Israel continues to be of great concern for Israeli
   defense officials.^[176] In 2006—the year following Israel's
   disengagement from the Gaza Strip—the Israeli government claimed to
   have recorded 1,726 such launches, more than four times the total
   rockets fired in 2005.^[168]^[177] As of January 2009, over 8,600
   rockets have been launched,^[178]^[179] causing widespread
   psychological trauma and disruption of daily life.^[180] Over 500
   rockets and mortars hit Israel in January–September 2010 and over 1,947
   rockets hit Israel in January–November 2012.

   According to a study conducted by University of Haifa, one in five
   Israelis have lost a relative or friend in a Palestinian terrorist
   attack.^[181]

   There is significant debate within Israel about how to deal with the
   country's security concerns. Options have included military action
   (including targeted killings and house demolitions of terrorist
   operatives), diplomacy, unilateral gestures toward peace, and increased
   security measures such as checkpoints, roadblocks and security
   barriers. The legality and the wisdom of all of the above tactics have
   been called into question by various commentators.^[14]^[unreliable
   source?]

   Since mid-June 2007, Israel's primary means of dealing with security
   concerns in the West Bank has been to cooperate with and permit United
   States-sponsored training, equipping, and funding of the Palestinian
   Authority's security forces, which with Israeli help have largely
   succeeded in quelling West Bank supporters of Hamas.^[182]

  Palestinian violence outside of Israel

   Some Palestinians have committed violent acts over the globe on the
   pretext of a struggle against Israel.^[183]^[184]

   During the late 1960s, the PLO became increasingly infamous for its use
   of international terror. In 1969 alone, the PLO was responsible for
   hijacking 82 planes. El Al Airlines became a regular hijacking
   target.^[185]^[186] The hijacking of Air France Flight 139 by the
   Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine culminated during a
   hostage-rescue mission, where Israeli special forces successfully
   rescued the majority of the hostages.

   However, one of the most well-known and notorious terrorist acts was
   the capture and eventual murder of 11 Israeli athletes during the 1972
   Olympic Games.^[187]

  Palestinian-on-Palestinian violence

   [220px-2013_Fatah_anniversary_rally_in_Gaza_%2804%29.jpg] A
   demonstration in support of Fatah in Gaza City in January 2013

   Fighting among rival Palestinian and Arab movements has played a
   crucial role in shaping Israel's security policy towards Palestinian
   militants, as well as in the Palestinian leadership's own
   policies.^[citation needed] As early as the 1930s revolts in Palestine,
   Arab forces fought each other while also skirmishing with Zionist and
   British forces, and internal conflicts continue to the present day.
   During the Lebanese Civil War, Palestinian baathists broke from the
   Palestine Liberation Organization and allied with the Shia Amal
   Movement, fighting a bloody civil war that killed thousands of
   Palestinians.^[188]^[189]

   In the First Intifada, more than a thousand Palestinians were killed in
   a campaign initiated by the Palestine Liberation Organization to crack
   down on suspected Israeli security service informers and collaborators.
   The Palestinian Authority was strongly criticized for its treatment of
   alleged collaborators, rights groups complaining that those labeled
   collaborators were denied fair trials. According to a report released
   by the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group, less than 45 percent
   of those killed were actually guilty of informing for Israel.^[190]

   In the Gaza Strip, Hamas officials have tortured and killed thousands
   of Fatah members and other Palestinians who oppose their rule. During
   the Battle of Gaza, more than 150 Palestinians died over a four-day
   period.^[191] The violence among Palestinians was described as a civil
   war by some commentators. By 2007, more than 600 Palestinian people had
   died during the struggle between Hamas and Fatah.^[192]

   controlled by Israel under Oslo Accords, in blue and red, in December
   2011

   As far as Israel is concerned, the jurisdiction of the Palestinian
   Authority is derived from the Oslo Accords, signed with the PLO, under
   which it acquired control over cities in the Palestinian territories
   (Area A) while the surrounding countryside came either under Israeli
   security and Palestinian civil administration (Area B) or complete
   Israeli civil administration (Area C). Israel has built additional
   highways to allow Israelis to traverse the area without entering
   Palestinian cities in Area A. The initial areas under Palestinian
   Authority control are diverse and non-contiguous. The areas have
   changed over time by subsequent negotiations, including Oslo II, Wye
   River and Sharm el-Sheik. According to Palestinians, the separated
   areas make it impossible to create a viable nation and fails to address
   Palestinian security needs; Israel has expressed no agreement to
   withdrawal from some Areas B, resulting in no reduction in the division
   of the Palestinian areas, and the institution of a safe pass system,
   without Israeli checkpoints, between these parts.

   Under the Oslo Accords, as a security measure, Israel has insisted on
   its control over all land, sea and air border crossings into the
   Palestinian territories, and the right to set import and export
   controls. This is to enable Israel to control the entry into the
   territories of materials of military significance and of potentially
   dangerous persons.

   The PLO's objective for international recognition of the State of
   Palestine is considered by Israel as a provocative "unilateral" act
   that is inconsistent with the Oslo Accords.

  Water resources

   Further information: Water supply and sanitation in the Palestinian
   territories and Water politics in the Jordan River basin

   In the Middle East, water resources are of great political concern.
   Since Israel receives much of its water from two large underground
   aquifers which continue under the Green Line, the use of this water has
   been contentious in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Israel withdraws
   most water from these areas, but it also supplies the West Bank with
   approximately 40 million cubic metres annually, contributing to 77% of
   Palestinians' water supply in the West Bank, which is to be shared for
   a population of about 2.6 million.^[193]
   [220px-Water_supply_in_West_Bank_and_Gaza_February_2014_5water_photoblo
   g.jpg] Palestinian villagers purchase water from water trucks in
   Khirbet A-Duqaiqah in the Hebron Hills[220px-Ma%27ale_adumim_02.JPG] A
   swimming pool in the Israeli settlement of Ma'ale Adumim, West Bank

   While Israel's consumption of this water has decreased since it began
   its occupation of the West Bank, it still consumes the majority of it:
   in the 1950s, Israel consumed 95% of the water output of the Western
   Aquifer, and 82% of that produced by the Northeastern Aquifer. Although
   this water was drawn entirely on Israel's own side of the pre-1967
   border, the sources of the water are nevertheless from the shared
   groundwater basins located under both West Bank and Israel.^[194]

   In the Oslo II Accord, both sides agreed to maintain "existing
   quantities of utilization from the resources." In so doing, the
   Palestinian Authority established the legality of Israeli water
   production in the West Bank, subject to a Joint Water Committee (JWC).
   Moreover, Israel obligated itself in this agreement to provide water to
   supplement Palestinian production, and further agreed to allow
   additional Palestinian drilling in the Eastern Aquifer, also subject to
   the Joint Water Committee.^[195]^[196] The water that Israel receives
   comes mainly from the Jordan River system, the Sea of Galilee and two
   underground sources. According to a 2003 BBC article the Palestinians
   lack access to the Jordan River system.^[197]

   According to a report of 2008 by the Food and Agriculture Organization
   of the United Nations, water resources were confiscated for the benefit
   of the Israeli settlements in the Ghor. Palestinian irrigation pumps on
   the Jordan River were destroyed or confiscated after the 1967 war and
   Palestinians were not allowed to use water from the Jordan River
   system. Furthermore, the authorities did not allow any new irrigation
   wells to be drilled by Palestinian farmers, while it provided fresh
   water and allowed drilling wells for irrigation purposes at the Jewish
   settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.^[198]

   A report was released by the UN in August 2012 and Max Gaylard, the UN
   Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in the occupied Palestinian
   territory, explained at the launch of the publication: "Gaza will have
   half a million more people by 2020 while its economy will grow only
   slowly. In consequence, the people of Gaza will have an even harder
   time getting enough drinking water and electricity, or sending their
   children to school". Gaylard present alongside Jean Gough, of the UN
   Children's Fund (UNICEF), and Robert Turner, of the UN Relief and Works
   Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The report
   projects that Gaza's population will increase from 1.6 million people
   to 2.1 million people in 2020, leading to a density of more than 5,800
   people per square kilometre.^[199]

    Future and financing

   Numerous foreign nations and international organizations have
   established bilateral agreements with the Palestinian and Israeli water
   authorities. It was estimated that a future investment of about
   US$1.1bn for the West Bank and $0.8bn for the Gaza Strip Southern
   Governorates was needed for the planning period from 2003 to
   2015.^[200]

   In late 2012, a donation of $21.6 million was announced by the
   Government of the Netherlands—the Dutch government stated that the
   funds would be provided to the UN Relief and Works Agency for
   Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), for the specific benefit
   of Palestinian children. An article, published by the UN News website,
   stated that: "Of the $21.6 million, $5.7 will be allocated to UNRWA's
   2012 Emergency Appeal for the occupied Palestinian territory, which
   will support programmes in the West Bank and Gaza aiming to mitigate
   the effects on refugees of the deteriorating situation they
   face."^[199]

  Israeli occupation of the West Bank

   Occupied Palestinian Territory is the term used by the United Nations
   to refer to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza
   Strip—territories which were captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day
   War, having formerly been controlled by Egypt and Jordan.^[201]

   In 1980, Israel annexed East Jerusalem.^[202] Israel has never annexed
   the West Bank, apart from East Jerusalem, or Gaza Strip, and the United
   Nations has demanded the "[t]ermination of all claims or states of
   belligerency and respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty,
   territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the
   area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized
   boundaries free from threats or acts of force" and that Israeli forces
   withdraw "from territories occupied in the recent conflict" – the
   meaning and intent of the latter phrase is disputed. See
   Interpretations.

   It has been the position of Israel that the most Arab-populated parts
   of West Bank (without major Jewish settlements), as well as the entire
   Gaza Strip, must eventually be part of an independent Palestinian
   State; however, the precise borders of this state are in question. At
   Camp David, for example, then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered
   Arafat an opportunity to establish a non-militarized Palestinian State.
   The proposed state would consist of 77% of the West Bank split into two
   or three areas, followed by: an increase of 86–91% of the West Bank
   after six to twenty-one years; autonomy, but not sovereignty for some
   of the Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem surrounded by Israeli
   territory; the entire Gaza Strip; and the dismantling of most
   settlements.^[55] Arafat rejected the proposal without providing a
   counter-offer.

   A subsequent settlement proposed by President Clinton offered
   Palestinian sovereignty over 94 to 96 percent of the West Bank but was
   similarly rejected with 52 objections.^[54]^[203]^[204]^[12] The Arab
   League has agreed to the principle of minor and mutually agreed
   land-swaps as part of a negotiated two state settlement based in June
   1967 borders.^[205] Official U.S. policy also reflects the ideal of
   using the 1967 borders as a basis for an eventual peace
   agreement.^[206]^[207]

   Some Palestinians say they are entitled to all of the West Bank, Gaza
   Strip, and East Jerusalem. Israel says it is justified in not ceding
   all this land, because of security concerns, and also because the lack
   of any valid diplomatic agreement at the time means that ownership and
   boundaries of this land is open for discussion.^[208] Palestinians
   claim any reduction of this claim is a severe deprivation of their
   rights. In negotiations, they claim that any moves to reduce the
   boundaries of this land is a hostile move against their key interests.
   Israel considers this land to be in dispute and feels the purpose of
   negotiations is to define what the final borders will be. In 2017 Hamas
   announced that it was ready to support a Palestinian state on the 1967
   borders "without recognising Israel or ceding any rights".^[209] Hamas
   has previously viewed the peace process "as religiously forbidden and
   politically inconceivable".^[171]

    Israeli settlements

   Main article: Israeli settlement

   [260px-MaaleAdummim_red-roof.JPG] A neighbourhood in Ariel, home to the
   Ariel University

   According to the Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Affairs
   (DEMA), "In the years following the Six-Day War, and especially in the
   1990s during the peace process, Israel re-established communities
   destroyed in 1929 and 1948 as well as established numerous new
   settlements in the West Bank."^[210] These settlements were, as of
   2009, home to about 301,000 people.^[211] DEMA added, "Most of the
   settlements are in the western parts of the West Bank, while others are
   deep into Palestinian territory, overlooking Palestinian cities. These
   settlements have been the site of much inter-communal conflict."^[210]
   The issue of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and, until 2005, the
   Gaza Strip, have been described by the UK^[212] and the WEU^[213] as an
   obstacle to the peace process. The United Nations and the European
   Union have also called the settlements "illegal under international
   law."^[214]^[215]

   However, Israel disputes this;^[216] several scholars and commentators
   disagree with the assessment that settlements are illegal, citing in
   2005 recent historical trends to back up their argument.^[217]^[218]
   Those who justify the legality of the settlements use arguments based
   upon Articles 2 and 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, as well as UN
   Security Council Resolution 242.^[219]^[better source needed] On a
   practical level, some objections voiced by Palestinians are that
   settlements divert resources needed by Palestinian towns, such as
   arable land, water, and other resources; and, that settlements reduce
   Palestinians' ability to travel freely via local roads, owing to
   security considerations.^[citation needed]

   Former US President George W. Bush has stated that he does not expect
   Israel to return entirely to the 1949 armistice lines because of "new
   realities on the ground".^[220] One of the main compromise plans put
   forth by the Clinton Administration would have allowed Israel to keep
   some settlements in the West Bank, especially those which were in large
   blocs near the pre-1967 borders of Israel. In return, Palestinians
   would have received some concessions of land in other parts of the
   country.^[citation needed] The Obama administration viewed a complete
   freeze of construction in settlements on the West Bank as a critical
   step toward peace. In May and June 2009, President Barack Obama said,
   "The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli
   settlements",^[221] and the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, stated
   that the President "wants to see a stop to settlements—not some
   settlements, not outposts, not 'natural growth' exceptions."^[222]
   However, Obama has since declared that the United States will no longer
   press Israel to stop West Bank settlement construction as a
   precondition for continued peace-process negotiations with the
   Palestinian Authority.^[223]

   As of 2023, there were about 500,000 Israeli settlers living in the
   West Bank, with another 200,000 living in East
   Jerusalem.^[224]^[225]^[226] In February 2023, Israel's Finance
   Minister Bezalel Smotrich took charge of most of the Civil
   Administration, obtaining broad authority over civilian issues in the
   West Bank.^[227]^[228] In the first six months of 2023, 13,000 housing
   units were built in settlements, which is almost three times more than
   in the whole of 2022.^[229]

  Blockade of the Gaza Strip

   Main article: Blockade of the Gaza Strip

   [220px-Gazaday14.JPG] Israel's attack on Gaza in 2009

   The Israeli government states it is justified under international law
   to impose a blockade on an enemy for security reasons. The power to
   impose a naval blockade is established under customary international
   law and Laws of armed conflict, and a United Nations commission has
   ruled that Israel's blockade is "both legal and
   appropriate."^[230]^[231] The Israeli Government's continued land, sea
   and air blockage is tantamount to collective punishment of the
   population, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination
   of Humanitarian Affairs.^[232] The Military Advocate General of Israel
   has provided numerous reasonings for the policy:

     The State of Israel has been engaged in an ongoing armed conflict
     with terrorist organizations operating in the Gaza strip. This armed
     conflict has intensified after Hamas violently took over Gaza, in
     June 2007, and turned the territory under its de facto control into
     a launching pad of mortar and rocket attacks against Israeli towns
     and villages in southern Israel.^[233]

   According to Oxfam, because of an import-export ban imposed on Gaza in
   2007, 95% of Gaza's industrial operations were suspended. Out of 35,000
   people employed by 3,900 factories in June 2005, only 1,750 people
   remained employed by 195 factories in June 2007.^[234] By 2010, Gaza's
   unemployment rate had risen to 40% with 80% of the population living on
   less than 2 dollars a day.^[235]
   [450px-Rocket_Attacks_fired_at_Israel_from_the_Gaza_Strip_by_year.png]
   Rocket attacks fired at Israel from the Gaza Strip, 2001-2021^[236]

   In January 2008, the Israeli government calculated how many calories
   per person were needed to prevent a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza
   strip, and then subtracted eight percent to adjust for the "culture and
   experience" of the Gazans. Details of the calculations were released
   following Israeli human rights organization Gisha's application to the
   high court. Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the
   Territories, who drafted the plan, stated that the scheme was never
   formally adopted, this was not accepted by Gisha.^[237]^[238]^[239]

   Starting in February 2008, the Israeli Government reduced the
   electricity it sells directly to Gaza. This follows the ruling of
   Israel's High Court of Justice's decision, which held, with respect to
   the amount of industrial fuel supplied to Gaza, that, "The
   clarification that we made indicates that the supply of industrial
   diesel fuel to the Gaza Strip in the winter months of last year was
   comparable to the amount that the Respondents now undertake to allow
   into the Gaza Strip. This fact also indicates that the amount is
   reasonable and sufficient to meet the vital humanitarian needs in the
   Gaza Strip." Palestinian militants killed two Israelis in the process
   of delivering fuel to the Nahal Oz fuel depot.^[240]

   With regard to Israel's plan, the Court stated that, "calls for a
   reduction of five percent of the power supply in three of the ten power
   lines that supply electricity from Israel to the Gaza Strip, to a level
   of 13.5 megawatts in two of the lines and 12.5 megawatts in the third
   line, we [the Court] were convinced that this reduction does not breach
   the humanitarian obligations imposed on the State of Israel in the
   framework of the armed conflict being waged between it and the Hamas
   organization that controls the Gaza Strip. Our conclusion is based, in
   part, on the affidavit of the Respondents indicating that the relevant
   Palestinian officials stated that they can reduce the load in the event
   limitations are placed on the power lines, and that they had used this
   capability in the past."

   On 20 June 2010, Israel's Security Cabinet approved a new system
   governing the blockade that would allow practically all non-military or
   dual-use items to enter the Gaza strip. According to a cabinet
   statement, Israel would "expand the transfer of construction materials
   designated for projects that have been approved by the Palestinian
   Authority, including schools, health institutions, water, sanitation
   and more – as well as (projects) that are under international
   supervision."^[241] Despite the easing of the land blockade, Israel
   will continue to inspect all goods bound for Gaza by sea at the port of
   Ashdod.^[242]

   Prior to a Gaza visit, scheduled for April 2013, Turkey's Prime
   Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan explained to Turkish newspaper Hürriyet
   that the fulfilment of three conditions by Israel was necessary for
   friendly relations to resume between Turkey and Israel: an apology for
   the May 2010 Gaza flotilla raid (Prime Minister Netanyahu had delivered
   an apology to Erdogan by telephone on 22 March 2013), the awarding of
   compensation to the families affected by the raid, and the lifting of
   the Gaza blockade by Israel. The Turkish prime minister also explained
   in the Hürriyet interview, in relation to the April 2013 Gaza visit,
   "We will monitor the situation to see if the promises are kept or
   not."^[243] At the same time, Netanyahu affirmed that Israel would only
   consider exploring the removal of the Gaza blockade if peace ("quiet")
   is achieved in the area.^[244]

   On 9 October 2023, Israel declared war on Hamas and imposed a "total
   blockade" of the Gaza Strip.^[245] The blockade was announced by
   Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who declared: "There will be no
   electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed. We are fighting
   human animals and we are acting accordingly."^[246]^[247]

  Agricultural rights

   See also: Economy of the State of Palestine § Israeli–Palestinian
   relations

   Since the beginning of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, the conflict
   has been about land.^[248] When Israel became a state after the war in
   1948, 77% of Palestine's land was used for the creation on the
   state.^[249] The majority of those living in Palestine at the time
   became refugees in other countries and this first land crisis became
   the root of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.^[250] Because the root of
   the conflict is with land, the disputes between Israel and Palestine
   are well-manifested in the agriculture of Palestine.

   In Palestine, agriculture is a mainstay in the economy. The production
   of agricultural goods supports the population's sustenance needs and
   fuels Palestine's export economy.^[251] According to the Council for
   European Palestinian Relations, the agricultural sector formally
   employs 13.4% of the population and informally employs 90% of the
   population.^[251] Over the past 10 years^[when?], unemployment rates in
   Palestine have increased and the agricultural sector became the most
   impoverished sector in Palestine. Unemployment rates peaked in 2008
   when they reached 41% in Gaza.^[252]

   Palestinian agriculture suffers from numerous problems including
   Israeli military and civilian attacks on farms and farmers, blockades
   to exportation of produce and importation of necessary inputs,
   widespread confiscation of land for nature reserves as well as military
   and settler use, confiscation and destruction of wells, and physical
   barriers within the West Bank.^[253]

  Israel's West Bank barrier

   [220px-Holy_Land_2022_%281%29_P473_Bethlehem_barrier.jpg] The barrier
   between Israel and Palestine

   With the construction of the separation barrier, the Israeli state
   promised free movement across regions. However, border closures,
   curfews, and checkpoints has significantly restricted Palestinian
   movement.^[254] In 2012, there were 99 fixed check points and 310
   flying checkpoints.^[255] The border restrictions impacted the imports
   and exports in Palestine and weakened the industrial and agricultural
   sectors because of the constant Israeli control in the West Bank and
   Gaza.^[256] In order for the Palestinian economy to be prosperous, the
   restrictions on Palestinian land must be removed.^[253] According to
   The Guardian and a report for World Bank, the Palestinian economy lost
   $3.4bn (%35 of the annual GDP) to Israeli restrictions in the West Bank
   alone.^[257]

  Economic disputes and boycotts

   See also: Economy of the Palestinian territories and Boycott,
   Divestment, and Sanctions

   In Gaza, the agricultural market suffers from economic boycotts and
   border closures and restrictions placed by Israel.^[258] The PA's
   Minister of Agriculture estimates that around US$1.2 billion were lost
   in September 2006 because of these security measures. There has also
   been an economic embargo initiated by the west on Hamas-led Palestine,
   which has decreased the amount of imports and exports from
   Palestine.^[citation needed] This embargo was brought on by Hamas'
   refusal to recognize Israel's right to statehood.^[citation needed] As
   a result, the PA's 160,000 employees have not received their salaries
   in over one year.^[259]

Actions toward stabilizing the conflict

   In response to a weakening trend in Palestinian violence and growing
   economic and security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian
   Authority, the Israeli military removed over 120 check points in 2010
   and planned on disengaging from major Palestinian population areas.
   According to the IDF, terrorist activity in the West Bank decreased by
   97% compared to violence in 2002.^[260]

   PA–Israel efforts in the West Bank have "significantly increased
   investor confidence", and the Palestinian economy grew 6.8% in
   2009.^[261]^[262]^[263]^[264]
   [200px-Bank_Of_Palestine_-_Ramallah.jpg] Bank of Palestine

   Since the Second Intifada, Israel has banned Jewish Israelis from
   entering Palestinian cities. However, Israeli Arabs are allowed to
   enter West Bank cities on weekends.

   The Palestinian Authority has petitioned the Israeli military to allow
   Jewish tourists to visit West Bank cities as "part of an effort" to
   improve the Palestinian economy. Israeli general Avi Mizrahi spoke with
   Palestinian security officers while touring malls and soccer fields in
   the West Bank. Mizrahi gave permission to allow Israeli tour guides
   into Bethlehem, a move intended to "contribute to the Palestinian and
   Israeli economies."^[265]

  Mutual recognition

   Main article: Israel–PLO Letters of Mutual Recognition

    Between Israel and the PLO

   Beginning in 1993 with the Oslo peace process, Israel recognizes "the
   PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people", though Israel
   does not recognize the State of Palestine.^[266] In return, it was
   agreed that Palestinians would promote peaceful co-existence, renounce
   violence and promote recognition of Israel among their own people.
   Despite Yasser Arafat's official renunciation of terrorism and
   recognition of Israel, some Palestinian groups continue to practice and
   advocate violence against civilians and do not recognize Israel as a
   legitimate political entity.^[26]^[267]^[unreliable source?]
   Palestinians state that their ability to spread acceptance of Israel
   was greatly hampered by Israeli restrictions on Palestinian political
   freedoms, economic freedoms, civil liberties, and quality of life.

    Of Israel as a Jewish state

   The Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas has in recent years refused to
   recognize Israel as a Jewish state, citing concerns for Israeli Arabs
   and a possible future right to return for Palestinian refugees, though
   Palestine continues to recognize Israel as a state.^[268]^[269]

   This article needs to be updated. Please help update this article to
   reflect recent events or newly available information. (January 2023)

   The leader of al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, which is Fatah's official
   military wing, has stated that any peace agreement must include the
   right of return of Palestinian refugees into lands now part of Israel,
   which some Israeli commenters view as "destroying the Jewish
   state".^[270] In 2006, Hamas won a majority in the Palestinian
   Legislative Council, where it remains the majority party. Hamas'
   charter openly states they seek Israel's destruction, though Hamas
   leaders have spoken of long-term truces with Israel in exchange for an
   end to the occupation of Palestinian territory.^[267]^[271]

  Palestinian government

   [220px-West_Bank_Access_Restrictions_%28United_Nations_OCHA_oPt%29_May_
   2023.jpg] Palestinian enclaves in May 2023 (Area A and B under the Oslo
   II Accord). Area A (light yellow) is exclusively administered by the
   Fatah-controlled Palestinian Authority.

   The Palestinian Authority is considered corrupt by a wide variety of
   sources, including some Palestinians.^[272]^[273]^[274] Some Israelis
   argue that it provides tacit support for militants via its relationship
   with Hamas and other Islamic militant movements, and that therefore it
   is unsuitable for governing any putative Palestinian state or
   (especially according to the right wing of Israeli politics), even
   negotiating about the character of such a state.^[208] Because of that,
   a number of organizations, including the previously ruling Likud party,
   declared they would not accept a Palestinian state based on the current
   PA.

    Palestinian security apparatus

   Starting in 2006, the United States began training, equipping, and
   funding the Palestinian Authority's security forces, which had been
   cooperating with Israel at unprecedented levels in the West Bank to
   quell supporters of Hamas.^[182] The US government has spent over $500
   million building and training the Palestinian National Security Forces
   and Presidential Guard.^[182] The IDF maintains that the US-trained
   forces will soon be capable of "overrunning small IDF outposts and
   isolated Israeli communities" in the event of a conflict.^[275]

  Views on dialogue versus violence

   Societal attitudes in both Israel and Palestine are a source of concern
   to those promoting dispute resolution.

   According to a June 2022 poll carried out by the Palestinian Center for
   Policy and Survey Research that asked Palestinians from the Gaza Strip
   and the West Bank including East Jerusalem, "which of the following
   means is the most effective means of ending the Israeli occupation and
   building an independent state", 50% supported "armed struggle", 22%
   favored negotiations until an agreement could be reached, and 21%
   supported non-violent popular resistance.^[18] 59% of respondents cite
   the armed attack inside Israel carried out by Palestinians unaffiliated
   with known armed groups as contributing to ending the occupation; 37%
   disagree. Residents of the Gaza Strip, youth, students, low-income
   workers, public sector employees, and Hamas supporters are more likely
   to believe that armed attacks contribute to the national interest.^[18]
   An unconditional resumption of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations is
   opposed by 69% of Palestinians and supported by 22%. A return to
   dialogue with the new US administration under Joe Biden is opposed by
   65% of Palestinians, while 29% are in favor.^[18]

Fatalities

   See also: Israeli casualties of war and Palestinian casualties of war

   A variety of studies provide aggregated casualty data for the
   Israeli–Palestinian conflict. According to the Stockholm International
   Peace Research Institute, 13,000 Israelis and Palestinians were killed
   in conflict with each other between 1948 and 1997.^[276] Other
   estimations give 14,500 killed between 1948 and 2009.^[276]^[277]
   Palestinian fatalities during the 1982 Lebanon War were 2,000 PLO
   combatants killed in armed conflict with Israel.^[278]

   According to B'tselem, during the first intifada from 1987 until 2000,
   1,551 Palestinians and 421 Israelis lost their lives.^[279] According
   to the database of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of
   Humanitarian Affairs - occupied Palestinian territory (OCHAoPt), 6,407
   Palestinians and 308 Israelis were killed in the ongoing
   Israeli–Palestinian conflict from 2008 to September 2023, before the
   2023 Israel–Hamas war.^[280]^[281]

   Figures include both Israeli civilians and security forces casualties
   in West Bank, Gaza and Israel. All numbers refer to casualties of
   direct conflict between Israelis and Palestinians including in IDF
   military operations, artillery shelling, search and arrest campaigns,
   barrier demonstrations, targeted killings, settler violence etc. The
   figures do not include events indirectly related to the conflict such
   as casualties from unexploded ordnance, etc., or events when the
   circumstances remain unclear or are in dispute. The figures include all
   reported casualties of all ages and both genders.^[283]

  Criticism of casualty statistics

   As reported by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, since 29
   September 2000 a total of 7,454 Palestinian and Israeli individuals
   were killed due to the conflict. According to the report, 1,317 of the
   6,371 Palestinians were minors, and at least 2,996 did not participate
   in fighting at the time of death. Palestinians killed 1,083 Israelis,
   including 741 civilians, of whom 124 were minors.^[285]

   The Israeli-based International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism
   criticized the methodology of Israeli and Palestinian rights groups,
   including B'Tselem, and questioned their accuracy in classifying
   civilian/combatant ratios.^[286]^[287]

  Landmines and unexploded ordnance

   A comprehensive collection mechanism to gather land mine and explosive
   remnants of war (ERW) casualty data does not exist for the Palestinian
   territories.^[288] In 2009, the United Nations Mine Action Centre
   reported that more than 2,500 mine and explosive remnants of war
   casualties occurred between 1967 and 1998, at least 794 casualties (127
   killed, 654 injured and 13 unknown) occurred between 1999 and 2008 and
   that 12 people had been killed and 27 injured since the Gaza War.^[288]
   The UN Mine Action Centre identified the main risks as coming from "ERW
   left behind by Israeli aerial and artillery weapon systems, or from
   militant caches targeted by the Israeli forces."^[288] There are at
   least 15 confirmed minefields in the West Bank on the border with
   Jordan. The Palestinian National Security Forces do not have maps or
   records of the minefields.^[288]

Explanatory notes

    1. ^ Three factors made Israel's territorial offer less forthcoming
       than it initially appeared. First, the 91 percent land offer was
       based on the Israeli definition of the West Bank, but this differs
       by approximately 5 percentage points from the Palestinian
       definition. Palestinians use a total area of 5,854 square
       kilometers. Israel, however, omits the area known as No Man's Land
       (50 km^2 near Latrun), post-1967 East Jerusalem (71 km^2), and the
       territorial waters of the Dead Sea (195 km^2), which reduces the
       total to 5,538 km^2. Thus, an Israeli offer of 91 percent (of
       5,538 km^2 of the West Bank translates into only 86 percent from
       the Palestinian perspective.

   "is possibly even its very raison d'etre as a Jewish state."19"

   discriminatory effect for Palestinian Arab people since it allows any
   Jew to immigrate to Israel, while – at the same time – it deprives all
   native Palestinian Arab refugees residing outside the borders of the

   the 1948 war that broke out because of the establishment of Israel."

   heading of "Discrimination", the Committee cited Israel's Law of Return
   as discriminatory against Palestinian refugees because of Israel's
   refusal to readmit them. The committee said: "The Committee notes with
   concern that the Law of Return which permits any Jew from anywhere in
   the world to immigrate and thereby virtually automatically enjoy
   residence and obtain citizenship in Israel, discriminates against
   Palestinians in the Diaspora upon whom the Government of Israel has
   imposed restrictive requirements that make it almost impossible to

   War film is a film genre concerned with warfare, typically about naval,
   air, or land battles, with combat scenes central to the drama.^[1]^[2]
   Themes explored include combat, survival and escape, camaraderie
   between soldiers, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the
   effects of war on society, and the moral and human issues raised by
   war. The stories told may be fiction, historical drama, or
   biographical.

   Subgenres, not necessarily distinct, include anti-war, comedy,
   propaganda, and documentary. There are similarly subgenres of the war
   film in specific theatres such as the Western Desert of North Africa
   and the Pacific in the Second World War, Vietnam, or the Soviet–Afghan
   War; and films set in specific domains of war, such as the infantry,
   the air, at sea, in submarines or at prisoner of war camps.

Genre[edit]

   Further information: List of war films

   The war film genre is not necessarily tightly defined: the American
   Film Institute, for example, speaks of "films to grapple with the Great
   War" without attempting to classify these.^[3] However, some directors
   and critics have offered at least tentative definitions. The director
   Sam Fuller defined the genre by saying that "a war film's objective, no
   matter how personal or emotional, is to make a viewer feel war."^[4]
   John Belton identified four narrative elements of the war film within
   the context of Hollywood production: a) the suspension of civilian
   morality during times of war, b) primacy of collective goals over
   individual motivations, c) rivalry between men in predominantly male
   groups as well as marginalization and objectification of women, and d)
   depiction of the reintegration of veterans.^[5] The fateful nature of
   battle scenes means that war films often end with them.^[6]

   Longest Day, 1962

   The film critic Stephen Neale suggests that the genre is for the most
   part well defined and uncontentious, since war films are simply those
   about war being waged in the 20th century, with combat scenes central
   to the drama. However, Neale notes, films set in the American Civil War
   or the American Indian Wars of the 19th century were called war films
   in the time before the First World War.^[1] The critic Julian Smith
   argues, on the contrary, that the war film lacks the formal boundaries
   of a genre like the Western, but that in practice, "successful and
   influential" war films are about modern wars, in particular World War
   II, with the combination of mobile forces and mass killing.^[2] The
   film scholar Kathryn Kane^[7] points out some similarities between the
   war film genre and the Western. Both genres use opposing concepts like
   war and peace, civilization and savagery. War films usually frame World
   War II as a conflict between "good" and "evil" as represented by the
   Allied forces and Nazi Germany whereas the Western portrays the
   conflict between civilized settlers and the savage indigenous
   peoples.^[8] James Clarke notes the similarity between a Western like
   Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch and "war-movie escapades" like The Dirty
   Dozen.^[9]

   The film historian Jeanine Basinger states that she began with a
   preconception of what the war film genre would be, namely that:

     What I knew in advance was what presumably every member of our
     culture would know about World War II combat films—that they
     contained a hero, a group of mixed types [of people], and a military
     objective of some sort. They take place in the actual combat zones
     of World War II, against the established enemies, on the ground, the
     sea, or in the air. They contain many repeated events, such as mail
     call, all presented visually with appropriate uniforms, equipment,
     and iconography of battle.^[10]

   Further, Basinger considers Bataan to provide a definition-by-example
   of "the World War II combat film", in which a diverse and apparently
   unsuited group of "hastily assembled volunteers" hold off a much larger
   group of the enemy through their "bravery and tenacity".^[11] She
   argues that the combat film is not a subgenre but the only genuine kind
   of war film. Since she notes that there were in fact only five true
   combat films made during the Second World War, in her view these few
   films, central to the genre, are outweighed by the many other films
   that are only just war films.^[12] However, other critics such as
   Russell Earl Shain propose a far broader definition of war film, to
   include films that deal "with the roles of civilians, espionage agents,
   and soldiers in any of the aspects of war (i.e. preparation, cause,
   prevention, conduct, daily life, and consequences or aftermath.)"^[13]
   Neale points out that genres overlap, with combat scenes for different
   purposes in other types of film, and suggests that war films are
   characterised by combat which "determines the fate of the principal
   characters". This in turn pushes combat scenes to the climactic ends of
   war films.^[6] Not all critics agree, either, that war films must be
   about 20th-century wars. James Clarke includes Edward Zwick's
   Oscar-winning Glory (1990) among the war films he discusses in detail;
   it is set in the American Civil War, and he lists six other films about
   that war which he considers "notable".^[14]^[a] The screenwriter and
   scholar Eric R. Williams identifies war films as one of eleven
   super-genres in his screenwriters' taxonomy, claiming that all
   feature-length narrative films can be classified as belonging to one of
   them.^[b]^[16]

   The British military historian Antony Beevor "despair[s]" at how
   film-makers from America and Britain "play fast and loose with the
   facts", yet imply that "their version is as good as the truth".^[17]
   For example, he calls the 2000 American film U-571 a "shameless
   deception" for pretending that a US warship had helped to win the
   Battle of the Atlantic—seven months before America entered the
   war.^[17] He is equally critical of Christopher Nolan's 2017 film
   Dunkirk with its unhistorically empty beaches, low-level air combat
   over the sea, and rescues mainly by the "little ships".^[17] Beevor
   feels, however, that Continental European film-makers are often "far
   more scrupulous"; for example, in his view the 2004 German film
   Downfall accurately depicted the historical events of Hitler's final
   days in his Berlin bunker,^[17] and he considers the 1965 French film
   The 317th Platoon, set in Vietnam, "the greatest war movie ever made".
   The 1966 film The Battle of Algiers is, he argues, a close second.^[17]

History[edit]

American Civil War[edit]

   The costliest war in U.S. history in terms of American life, this war
   has been the subject of, or the backdrop to, numerous films,
   documentaries and mini-series. One of the earliest films using the
   Civil War as its subject was D.W. Griffith's 1910 silent picture, The
   Fugitive.^[18] Films that have the war as its main subject, or about a
   certain aspect of the war, include the 1989 film Glory, about the first
   formal unit of the Union Army during the American Civil War to be made
   up entirely of Black volunteers.^[19] Some films such as Gettysburg
   focused on a single battle during the war,^[20] or even on a single
   incident, like the French short film La Rivière du Hibou (An Occurrence
   at Owl Creek Bridge)^[21] and Disney's The Great Locomotive Chase
   (1956).^[22] Others like the 1993 miniseries North and South spanned
   the entire breadth of the war. Some films deal with the human aspects
   of the war, such as The Red Badge of Courage (1951),^[23] or Shenandoah
   (1965), on the tragedy that the war inflicted on the civilian
   population.^[24] Ken Burns's The Civil War is the most-watched
   documentary in the history of PBS.^[25]

   grosse Schlacht in Frankreich (The Great Battle in France), with
   Hindenburg in the background

The Spanish–American War[edit]

   The first war films come from the Spanish–American War of 1898. Short
   "actualities"—documentary film-clips—included Burial of the Maine
   Victims, Blanket-Tossing of a New Recruit, and Soldiers Washing Dishes.
   These non-combat films were accompanied by "reenactments" of fighting,
   such as of Theodore Roosevelt's "Rough Riders" in action against the
   Spanish, staged in the United States.^[26]

First World War[edit]

   United Kingdom during the First World War § Media, United States home
   front during World War I § Motion pictures, and Home front during World
   War I

   During the First World War, many films were made about life in the war.
   Topics included prisoners of war, covert operations, and military
   training. Both the Central Powers and the Allies produced war
   documentaries. The films were also used as propaganda in neutral
   countries like the United States. Among these was a film shot on the
   Eastern Front by official war photographer to the Central Powers,
   Albert K. Dawson: The Battle and Fall of Przemysl (1915), depicting the
   Siege of Przemyśl, disastrous for the Austrians, with incidents
   reenacted using soldiers as extras.^[27]^[28]

   The 1915 Australian film Within Our Gates (also known as Deeds that Won
   Gallipoli) by Frank Harvey was described by the Motion Picture News as
   "a really good war story, which is exceptional".^[29]
   [300px-The_Battle_of_the_Somme_film_image1.jpg] Staged scene of British
   troops advancing through barbed wire from The Battle of the Somme, 1916

   The 1916 British film The Battle of the Somme, by two official
   cinematographers, Geoffrey Malins and John McDowell, combined
   documentary and propaganda, seeking to give the public an impression of
   what trench warfare was like. Much of the film was shot on location at
   the Western Front in France; it had a powerful emotional impact. It was
   watched by some 20 million people in Britain in its six weeks of
   exhibition, making it what the critic Francine Stock called "one of the
   most successful films of all time".^[30]^[31]

   The 1925 American film The Big Parade depicted unglamorous elements of
   war: the protagonist loses his leg, and his friends are killed.^[32]
   William A. Wellman's Wings (1927) showed aerial combat during the war
   and was made in cooperation with the Army Air Corps. It proved a
   powerful recruiting tool.^[33] It became the first film (in any genre)
   to be awarded an Oscar for best picture.^[34] Later films of varied
   genres that deal with the First World War include David Lean's
   "colossal epic", both war film and biopic^[35] Lawrence of Arabia
   (1962), shot in the then unfamiliar and exciting 70mm Technicolor,^[36]
   and described by Steven Spielberg as "maybe the greatest screenplay
   ever written for the motion-picture medium";^[35] Richard
   Attenborough's satirical anti-war musical comedy based on Joan
   Littlewood's play of the same name, Oh! What a Lovely War (1969);^[37]
   Spielberg's 2011 war drama War Horse was based on Michael Morpurgo's
   children's novel of the same name.^[38]

   Many of the films promoted as "documentaries" added context to
   authentic battlefield scenes by staging critical events, and invented
   episodes and dialog to enhance excitement at the cost of
   authenticity.^[39]

Finnish Civil War[edit]

   Although the 1918 Finnish Civil War between Whites and Reds remained a
   controversial topic a century later in Finland,^[40]^[41] many Finnish
   filmmakers have taken up the subject, often basing their work on a
   book. In 1957, Toivo Särkkä's 1918, based on Jarl Hemmer's play and
   novel, was screened at the 7th Berlin International Film Festival.^[42]
   Recent films include Lauri Törhönen's 2007 The Border,^[43]^[44] and
   Aku Louhimies's 2008 Tears of April, based on Leena Lander's
   novel.^[45] Perhaps the most famous film about the Finnish Civil War is
   Edvin Laine's 1968 Here, Beneath the North Star, based on the first two
   books of Väinö Linna's Under the North Star trilogy; it describing the
   civil war from the losing side, Finland's Red Guards.^[46]

Spanish Civil War[edit]

   Further information: List of Spanish Civil War films

   [180px-SovietSpainCivilWarPoster.jpg] Soviet poster for an exhibition
   about the Spanish Civil War, 1936

   The Spanish Civil War has attracted directors from different countries.
   Sam Wood's For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), based on Ernest Hemingway's
   book of the same name, portrays the fated romance between an American
   played by Gary Cooper and a partisan played by Ingrid Bergman against
   the backdrop of the civil war. The epic 168-minute film with its
   landscapes shot in Technicolor and a "beautiful" orchestral score was a
   success both with audiences and with critics.^[47] Alain Resnais's
   Guernica (1950) uses Picasso's 1937 painting of the same name to
   protest against war.^[47] Carlos Saura's La Caza (The Hunt, 1966) uses
   the metaphor of hunting to criticise the aggressiveness of Spanish
   fascism.^[48] It won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 16th
   Berlin International Film Festival in 1966.^[49] Ken Loach's Land and
   Freedom (Tierra y Libertad, 1995), loosely based on George Orwell's
   Homage to Catalonia, follows a British communist through the war to
   reveal the painful contradictions within the anti-fascist Republican
   side.^[47]

  Korean War[edit]

   See also: Category:Korean War films

   Samuel Fuller's The Steel Helmet (1951) was made during the Korean War
   (1950–1953). The critic Guy Westwell notes that it questioned the
   conduct of the war, as did later films like The Bridges at Toko-Ri
   (1954) and Pork Chop Hill (1959).^[50] Fuller agreed that all his films
   were anti-war. No Hollywood films about the Korean War did well at the
   box office; the historian Lary May suggested in 2001 that they reminded
   American viewers of "the only war we have lost".^[51]

   In 1955, after the fighting, the successful South Korean action film
   Piagol about leftist guerrilla atrocities encouraged other film-makers.
   The 1960s military government punished pro-communist film-makers and
   gave Grand Bell Awards to films with the strongest anti-communist
   message. The Taebaek Mountains (1994) dealt with leftists from the
   south who fought for the communists, while Silver Stallion (1991) and
   Spring in My Hometown (1998) showed the destructive impact of American
   military presence on village life. The violent action films Shiri
   (1999) and Joint Security Area (2000) presented North Korea in a
   favourable light.^[52]

   Films in North Korea were made by government film studios and had clear
   political messages. The first was My Home Village (1949), on the
   liberation of Korea from the Japanese, presented as the work of Kim Il
   Sung without help from the Americans. Similarly, the country's films
   about the Korean War show victory without help from the Chinese. The
   film scholar Johannes Schönherr concludes that the purpose of these
   films is "to portray North Korea as a country under siege", and that
   since the U.S. and its "puppet" South Korea invaded the North once,
   they would do so again.^[53]

  Algerian War[edit]

   Gillo Pontecorvo's dramatic The Battle of Algiers ((Italian: La
   battaglia di Algeri; Arabic: معركة الجزائر; French: La Bataille
   d'Alger), 1966) portrayed events in the Algerian War (1954–1956). It
   was shot on location as an Italo-Algerian co-production. It had the
   black and white newsreel style of Italian neorealism, and even-handedly
   depicts violence on both sides. It won various awards including Golden
   Lion at the Venice Film Festival.^[54] It was attacked by French
   critics and was for five years banned in France as well as Jamila, the
   Algerian (1958).^[55]

  Vietnam War[edit]

   Further information: Vietnam War in film

   Few films before the late 1970s about the Vietnam War actually depicted
   combat;^[56] exceptions include The Green Berets (1968).^[56] Critics
   such as Basinger explain that Hollywood avoided the subject because of
   opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, making the
   subject divisive; in addition, the film industry was in crisis, and the
   army did not wish to assist in making anti-war films.^[56]^[57]

   From the late 1970s, independently financed and produced films showed
   Hollywood that Vietnam could be treated in film. Successful but very
   different portrayals of the war in which America had been defeated
   included Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter (1978), and Francis Ford
   Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979).^[56] With the shift in American
   politics to the right in the 1980s, military success could again be
   shown in films such as Oliver Stone's Platoon (1986), Stanley Kubrick's
   Full Metal Jacket (1987) and John Irvin's Hamburger Hill (1987).^[56]

   The Vietnamese director Nguyễn Hồng Sến [vi]'s The Abandoned Field:
   Free Fire Zone (Cánh đồng hoang, 1979) gives an "unnerving and
   compelling .. subjective-camera-eye-view" of life under helicopter fire
   in the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War. The film cuts to an
   (American) "helicopter-eye view", contrasting painfully with the human
   tenderness seen earlier.^[58]

  Later wars[edit]

   Dino Mustafić's Remake (2003), written by Zlatko Topčić, tells the
   parallel coming-of-age stories of a father living in Sarajevo during
   World War II and his son living through the Siege of Sarajevo during
   the Bosnian War. According to Topčić, the story is based on incidents
   from his own life.^[59]^[60]

   The Iraq War served as the background story of U.S. movies, like The
   Hurt Locker from 2008, Green Zone from 2010,^[61] and American Sniper
   from 2014.

   The War in Afghanistan since 2001 was depicted in various movies, among
   them Restrepo in 2010 and Lone Survivor from 2013.^[61]

Second World War[edit]

  Made by Western Allies[edit]

   Further information: List of Allied propaganda films of World War II

   The first popular Allied war films made during the Second World War
   came from Britain and combined the functions of documentary and
   propaganda. Films such as The Lion Has Wings and Target for Tonight
   were made under the control of the Films Division of the Ministry of
   Information. The British film industry began to combine documentary
   techniques with fictional stories in films like Noël Coward and David
   Lean's In Which We Serve (1942)—"the most successful British film of
   the war years"^[62]—Millions Like Us (1943), and The Way Ahead
   (1944).^[63]
   [220px-Thirty-seconds-over-tokyo.jpg] B-25s about to launch from the
   USS Hornet in Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944)

   In America, documentaries were produced in various ways: General
   Marshall commissioned the Why We Fight propaganda series from Frank
   Capra; the War Department's Information-Education Division started out
   making training films for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy; the Army
   made its own through the U.S. Signal Corps, including John Huston's The
   Battle of San Pietro.^[64] Hollywood made films with propaganda
   messages about America's allies, such as Mrs. Miniver (1942), which
   portrayed a British family on the home front;^[65] Edge of Darkness
   (1943) showed Norwegian resistance fighters,^[66] and The North Star
   (1943) showed the Soviet Union and its Communist Party.^[67] Towards
   the end of the war popular books provided higher quality and more
   serious stories for films such as Guadalcanal Diary (1943),^[68] Mervyn
   LeRoy's Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944),^[69] and John Ford's They
   Were Expendable (1945).^[70]

   Battle of Moscow

   The Soviet Union, too, appreciated the propaganda value of film, to
   publicise both victories and German atrocities. Ilya Kopalin's
   documentary Moscow Strikes Back (Russian: Разгром немецких войск под
   Москвой, literally "The rout of the German troops near Moscow"), was
   made during the Battle of Moscow between October 1941 and January 1942.
   It depicted civilians helping to defend the city, the parade in Red
   Square and Stalin's speech rousing the Russian people to battle, actual
   fighting, Germans surrendering and dead, and atrocities including
   murdered children and hanged civilians. It won an Academy Award in 1943
   for best documentary.^[71]^[72] Newsreel cameras were similarly rushed
   to Stalingrad early in 1943 to record "the spectacle which greeted the
   Russian soldiers"—the starvation of Russian prisoners of war in the
   Voropovono camp by the German Sixth Army, defeated in the Battle of
   Stalingrad.^[73]

   Feature films made in the west during the war were subject to
   censorship and were not always realistic in nature. One of the first to
   attempt to represent violence, and which was praised at the time for
   "gritty realism", was Tay Garnett's Bataan (1943). The depiction
   actually remained stylised. Jeanine Basinger gives as an example the
   "worst image for stark violence" when a Japanese soldier beheads an
   American: the victim shows pain and his lips freeze in a scream, yet no
   blood spurts and his head does not fall off. Basinger points out that
   while this is physically unrealistic, psychologically it may not have
   been. The wartime audience was, she points out, well aware of friends
   and relatives who had been killed or who had come home wounded.^[74]

  Made by Axis powers[edit]

   World War II

   in 1935. The studio made propaganda films such as Triumph des Willens
   (1935) and Kolberg (1945).

   The Axis powers similarly made films during the Second World War, for
   propaganda and other purposes. In Germany, the army high command
   brought out Sieg im Westen ("Victory in the West", 1941).^[75] Other
   Nazi propaganda films had varied subjects, as with Kolberg (1945),
   which depicts stubborn Prussian resistance in the Siege of Kolberg
   (1807) to the invading French troops under Napoleon.^[76] The
   propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels chose the historical subject as
   suitable for the worsening situation facing Nazi Germany when it was
   filmed from October 1943 to August 1944. At over eight million marks,
   using thousands of soldiers as extras and 100 railway wagonloads of
   salt to simulate snow, it was the most costly German film made during
   the war. The actual siege ended with the surrender of the town; in the
   film, the French generals abandon the siege.^[77]

   For Japan, the war began with the undeclared war and invasion of China
   in 1937, which the Japanese authorities called "The China Incident".
   The government dispatched a "pen brigade" to write and film the action
   in China with "humanist values". Tomotaka Tasaka's Mud and Soldiers
   (1939) for instance, shot on location in China, Kōzaburō Yoshimura's
   Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi, and Sato Takeshi's Chocolate and
   Soldiers (1938) show the common Japanese soldier as an individual and
   as a family man, and even enemy Chinese soldiers are presented as
   individuals, sometimes fighting bravely.^[78] Once war with the United
   States was declared, the Japanese conflict became known as the Pacific
   War. Japanese film critics worried that even with Western film
   techniques, their film output failed to represent native Japanese
   values.^[79] The historian John Dower found that Japanese wartime films
   had been largely forgotten, as "losers do not get reruns", yet they
   were so subtle and skilful that Frank Capra thought Chocolate and
   Soldiers unbeatable. Heroes were typically low-ranking officers, not
   samurai, calmly devoted to his men and his country.^[80] These films
   did not personalise the enemy and therefore lacked hatred, though Great
   Britain could figure as the "cultural enemy". For Japanese film-makers,
   war was not a cause but more like a natural disaster, and "what
   mattered was not whom one fought but how well". Asian enemies,
   especially the Chinese, were often portrayed as redeemable and even
   possible marriage partners. Japanese wartime films do not glorify war,
   but present the Japanese state as one great family and the Japanese
   people as an "innocent, suffering, self-sacrificing people". Dower
   comments that the perversity of this image "is obvious: it is devoid of
   any recognition that, at every level, the Japanese also victimized
   others."^[81]

  Postwar[edit]

   According to Andrew Pulver of The Guardian, the public fascination with
   war films became an "obsession", with over 200 war films produced in
   each decade of the 1950s and 1960s.^[82] War film production in the
   United Kingdom and United States reached its zenith in the mid-1950s.
   ^[83] Its popularity in the United Kingdom was brought on by the
   critical and commercial success of Charles Frend's The Cruel Sea
   (1953).^[83] Like others of the period, The Cruel Sea was based on a
   bestselling novel, in this case the former naval commander Nicholas
   Monsarrat's story of the battle of the Atlantic.^[84]^[85] Others, like
   The Dam Busters (1954), with its exciting tale of the inventor Barnes
   Wallis's unorthodox bouncing bomb and its distinctive theme music, were
   true stories. The Dam Busters became the most popular film in Britain
   in 1955,^[86] and remained a favourite as of 2015 with a 100% score on
   Rotten Tomatoes,^[87] though, partly because it celebrated an
   "exclusively British [victory]", it failed in the American market.^[88]
   A large number of war films were made in the 1955–1958 period in
   particular. In 1957 alone, Bitter Victory, Count Five and Die, The
   Enemy Below, Ill Met by Moonlight, Men in War, The One That Got Away,
   and Seven Thunders, and the highly successful, critically acclaimed
   pictures The Bridge on the River Kwai (which won the Academy Award for
   Best Picture that year^[89]) and Paths of Glory were released.^[90]
   Some, such as Bitter Victory, focused more on the psychological battle
   between officers and egotism rather than events during the war.^[91]
   The Bridge on the River Kwai brought a new complexity to the war
   picture, with a sense of moral uncertainty surrounding war. By the end
   of the decade the "sense of shared achievement" which had been common
   in war films "began to evaporate", according to Pulver.^[82]

   Hollywood films in the 1950s and 1960s could display spectacular
   heroics or self-sacrifice, as in the popular Sands of Iwo Jima (1949)
   starring John Wayne. U.S. Marines considered Sands of Iwo Jima visually
   authentic, but found Lewis Milestone's Battle Cry (1955), with its
   attention to the lives of the men, the more realistic film.^[92] The
   formula for a successful war film consisted, according to Lawrence
   Suid, of a small group of ethnically diverse men; an unreasonable
   senior officer; cowards became heroic, or died.^[92] Jeanine Basinger
   suggests that a traditional war film should have a hero, a group, and
   an objective, and that the group should contain "an Italian, a Jew, a
   cynical complainer from Brooklyn, a sharpshooter from the mountains, a
   midwesterner (nicknamed by his state, 'Iowa' or 'Dakota'), and a
   character who must be initiated in some way".^[74] Films based on real
   commando missions, like The Gift Horse (1952) based on the St. Nazaire
   Raid, and Ill Met by Moonlight (1956) based on the capture of the
   German commander of Crete, inspired fictional adventure films such as
   The Guns of Navarone (1961), The Train (1964), and Where Eagles Dare
   (1968). These used the war as a backdrop for spectacular action.^[82]

   Darryl F. Zanuck produced the 178 minute documentary drama The Longest
   Day (1962), based on the first day of the D-Day landings, achieving
   commercial success and Oscars.^[94] It was followed by large-scale but
   thoughtful films like Andrei Tarkovsky's Ivan's Childhood (1962), and
   quasi-documentary all-star epics filmed in Europe such as Battle of the
   Bulge (1965), Battle of Britain (1969), The Battle of Neretva (1969),
   Midway (1976), and A Bridge Too Far (1977). In Lawrence Suid's view,
   The Longest Day "served as the model for all subsequent combat
   spectaculars".^[95] However, its cost also made it the last of the
   traditional war films, while the controversy around the help given by
   the U.S. Army and Zanuck's "disregard for Pentagon relations" changed
   the way that Hollywood and the Army collaborated.^[95]

   Zanuck, by then an executive at 20th Century Fox, set up an
   American–Japanese co-production for Richard Fleischer's Tora! Tora!
   Tora! (1970) to depict what "really happened on December 7, 1941" in
   the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.^[96]^[97] The film, panned by
   Roger Ebert^[98] and The New York Times,^[99] was a major success in
   Japan.^[96] Its realistic-looking attack footage was reused in later
   films such as Midway (1976), The Final Countdown (1980), and Australia
   (2008).^[100] The story was revisited in Pearl Harbor (2001), described
   by The New York Times as a "noisy, expensive and very long new
   blockbuster", with the comment that "for all its epic pretensions (as
   if epic were a matter of running time, tumescent music and earnest
   voice-over pronouncements), the movie works best as a bang-and-boom
   action picture".^[101]

   Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (1998) uses hand-held camera,
   sound design, staging, and increased audio-visual detail to
   defamiliarise viewers accustomed to conventional combat films, so as to
   create what film historian Stuart Bender calls "reported realism",
   whether or not the portrayal is genuinely more realistic.^[102] Jeanine
   Basinger notes that critics experienced it as "groundbreaking and
   anti-generic", with, in James Wolcott's words, a "desire to bury the
   cornball, recruiting poster legend of John Wayne: to get it right this
   time"; and that combat films have always been "grounded in the need to
   help an audience understand and accept war".^[74] Its success revived
   interest in World War II films.^[103] Others tried to portray the
   reality of the war, as in Joseph Vilsmaier's Stalingrad (1993), which
   The New York Times said "goes about as far as a movie can go in
   depicting modern warfare as a stomach-turning form of mass
   slaughter".^[104]

  Military–film industry relations[edit]

   Many war films have been produced with the cooperation of a nation's
   military forces. Since the Second World War, the United States Navy has
   provided ships and technical guidance for films such as Top Gun. The
   U.S. Air Force assisted with The Big Lift, Strategic Air Command and A
   Gathering of Eagles, which were filmed on Air Force bases; Air Force
   personnel appeared in many roles.^[105] Critics have argued that the
   film Pearl Harbor's US-biased portrayal of events is a compensation for
   technical assistance received from the US armed forces, noting that the
   premiere was held on board a U.S. Navy carrier.^[106] In another case,
   the U.S. Navy objected to elements of Crimson Tide, especially mutiny
   on board an American naval vessel, so the film was produced without
   their assistance.^[107] The film historian Jonathan Rayner observes
   that such films "have also clearly been intended to serve vital
   propagandist, recruitment and public relations functions".^[106]

National traditions[edit]

  Chinese[edit]

   The first Chinese war films were newsreels like Battle of Wuhan (1911)
   and Battle of Shanghai (1913). Still in films such as Xu Xinfu's Battle
   Exploits (1925), war featured mainly as background. Only with the
   Second Sino–Japanese War from 1937 onwards did war film become a
   serious genre in China, with nationalistic films such as Shi Dongshan's
   Protect Our Land (1938). The Chinese Civil War, too, attracted films
   such as Cheng Yin's From Victory to Victory (1952). A more humanistic
   film set in the same period is Xie Jin's The Cradle (1979), while more
   recent large-scale commercial films include Lu Chuan's City of Life and
   Death (2009).^[108] Chinese directors have repeatedly attempted to
   cover the atrocities committed by the Japanese during the Nanjing
   Massacre (1937–1938), with films such as the political melodrama
   Massacre in Nanjing, Mou Tun Fei's docudrama Black Sun: The Nanking
   Massacre, and the "contrived Sino–Japanese romance" Don't Cry,
   Nanking.^[109] Zhang Yimou's epic Chinese film Flowers of War (2011),
   based on Geling Yan's novel, portrays the violent events through the
   eyes of a 13-year-old girl.^[110]

  Indonesian[edit]

   in combat, in a scene from Usmar Ismail's Darah dan Doa, 1950

   Many Indonesian films deal with the occupation of the archipelago by
   the Japanese during the Second World War. Teguh Karya's Doea Tanda Mata
   (Mementos, literally "Two Eye Marks", 1985) covers the limited
   nationalist resistance to Dutch colonial rule in the 1930s.^[111]^[112]
   A third group of films such as Enam Djam di Jogja (Six Hours in
   Yogyakarta, 1951) and Serangan Fajar (Attack at Dawn, 1983) covers the
   Indonesian war of independence (1945–1949). Two other films about the
   same period portray the Indonesian equivalent of the Chinese Long
   March: Usmar Ismail's Darah dan Doa (The Long March, literally "Blood
   and Prayer", 1950) and Mereka Kembali (They Return, 1975). Each of
   these films interprets the past from the perspective of its own
   time.^[112]

   The more recent Merdeka (Freedom) trilogy (2009–2011), starting with
   Merah Putih ("Red and White", the colours of the flag of the new
   Indonesia), revisits the campaign for independence through the lives of
   a diverse group of cadets who become guerillas.^[113]

   Karya's November 1828 (1979) looks at Indonesia's struggle for
   independence through historical drama about the Java or Diponegoro War
   (1825–1830), though the colonial enemy was the same, the Dutch. Deanne
   Schultz considered it "a valuable interpretation" of Indonesian history
   that "embodies the best of popular Indonesian cinema". It was the first
   Indonesian film to become well known internationally.^[114]

  Soviet[edit]

   [180px-Stalingrad_Ozerov.jpg] Russia's "cinema front": Yury Ozerov
   (left) directing the filming of Stalingrad, 1987

   War has been the Soviet Union's cinema's major genre, becoming known
   indeed as the "cinema front", and its war films ranged from grim
   portrayals of atrocities to sentimental and even quietly subversive
   accounts.^[115] Leonid Lukov's popular and "beautiful"^[116] Two
   Warriors (1943) depicted two stereotypical Soviet soldiers, a quiet
   Russian and an extrovert southerner from Odessa, singing in his
   dugout.^[117]

   The many Soviet films about the Second World War include both
   large-scale epics such as Yury Ozerov's Battle of Moscow (1985) and
   Mikhail Kalatozov's more psychological The Cranes are Flying (1957) on
   the cruel effects of war; it won the 1958 Palme d'Or at Cannes.^[118]

  Japanese[edit]

   See also: § Animated, and Category:Japanese war films

   Japanese directors have made popular films such as Submarine I-57 Will
   Not Surrender (1959), Battle of Okinawa (1971) and Japan's Longest Day
   (1967) from a Japanese perspective.^[119] These "generally fail to
   explain the cause of the war".^[120] In the decades immediately after
   the Second World War, Japanese films often focused on human tragedy
   rather than combat, such as The Burmese Harp (1956) and Fires on the
   Plain (1959).^[120] From the late 1990s, films started to take a
   positive view of the war and of Japanese actions. These nationalistic
   films, including Pride (1998), Merdeka 17805 (2001), and The Truth
   about Nanjing (2007), have emphasized positive traits of the Japanese
   military and contended that the Japanese were victims of post-war
   vindictiveness and viciousness. Such films have, however, been subject
   to protest for revisionism.^[120]^[121]^[122] The Eternal Zero (2013)
   narrates the tale of a Zero fighter pilot who is considered a coward by
   his comrades, as he returns alive from his missions. It broke the
   record takings for a Japanese live action film,^[123] and won the
   Golden Mulberry at the Udine Far East Film Festival,^[124] but was
   criticised for its nationalistic sympathy with kamikaze pilots.^[125]

Subgenres[edit]

  Documentary[edit]

   Further information: Documentary war film and List of World War II
   documentary films

   The wartime authorities in both Britain and America produced a wide
   variety of documentary films. Their purposes included military
   training, advice to civilians, and encouragement to maintain security.
   Since these films often carried messages, they grade into propaganda.
   Similarly, commercially produced films often combined information,
   support for the war effort, and a degree of propaganda.^[63]^[64]
   Newsreels, ostensibly simply for information, were made in both Allied
   and Axis countries, and were often dramatised.^[126]^[127]^[128] More
   recently, in the Iran–Iraq War, Morteza Avini's Ravayat-e Fath
   (Chronicles of Victory) television series combined front-line footage
   with commentary.^[129]

  Propaganda[edit]

   Sergei Eisenstein's 1938 historical drama Alexander Nevsky depicts
   Prince Alexander's defeat of the attempted invasion of the Russian city
   of Novgorod by the Teutonic Knights.^[130] By April 1939 the film had
   been seen by 23,000,000 people.^[131] In 1941 the director and three
   others were awarded the Stalin Prize for their contributions. The film
   features a musical score by the classical composer Sergei Prokofiev,
   considered by artists such as the composer André Previn the best ever
   written for cinema.^[132]^[133] Russell Merritt, writing in Film
   Quarterly, describes it as a "war propaganda film".^[134] A 1978
   Mondadori poll placed Alexander Nevsky among the world's 100 best
   motion pictures.^[135]
   [220px-Transmitlies.jpeg] Screenshot from Frank Capra's wartime Why We
   Fight series,^[136] depicting lies being broadcast by the Nazi
   propaganda machine

   During the Second World War, film propaganda was widely used. Kenneth
   Clark advised the British government that "If we renounced interest in
   entertainment as such, we might be deprived of a valuable weapon for
   getting across our propaganda"; he suggested using documentaries about
   the war and the war effort; celebrations of Britishness; and films
   about British life and character. Michael Powell and Clark agreed on a
   story about survivors of a U-boat crew, imbued with brutal Nazi
   ideology, travelling across Canada and meeting various kind, tolerant
   and intelligent Canadians, to encourage America into the war. The
   resulting film, 49th Parallel (1941), became the top film at British
   offices that year.^[137] Entertaining films could carry messages about
   the need for vigilance, too, as in Went the Day Well? (1942) or the
   avoidance of "careless talk", as in The Next of Kin (1942).^[63]
   [180px-CasablancaPoster-Gold.jpg] The romantic drama Casablanca (1943)

   In America, Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator (1940) clearly
   satirised fascism.^[138] Michael Curtiz's Casablanca (1943) was not
   simply a romance between the characters played by Humphrey Bogart and
   Ingrid Bergman, but vilified the Nazis and glorified resistance to
   them.^[138] Frank Capra's Why We Fight series (1942–1945) won the 1942
   Academy Award for best documentary, though it was designed to
   "influence opinion in the U.S. military".^[64]^[139]

   During the Cold War, "propaganda played as much of a role in the United
   States' struggle with the Soviet Union as did the billions of dollars
   spent on weaponry."^[140] Face to Face with Communism (1951) dramatised
   an imagined invasion of the United States; other films portrayed
   threats such as communist indoctrination.^[140]

  Submarine[edit]

   Main article: Submarine films

   [220px-Bavaria_Filmstudio_Das_Boot_4.jpg] The cramped, equipment-filled
   setting of a submarine film, Das Boot (1981), recreated in the Bavaria
   film studio

   Submarine films have their own particular meanings and conventions,
   concerned specifically with giving the effect of submarine warfare. A
   distinctive element in this subgenre is the soundtrack, which attempts
   to bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the
   sea. For example, in Wolfgang Petersen's 1981 Das Boot, the sound
   design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy
   pursuit with depth charges, the ping of sonar, and threatening sounds
   such as of the propellers of enemy destroyers and torpedoes.^[141]
   Classic films in the genre include The Enemy Below (1957)^[142] and Run
   Silent, Run Deep (1958), both based on novels by naval commanders. Run
   Silent, Run Deep is a movie full of tension, both with the enemy and
   between the contrasting personalities of the submarine Commander and
   his Lieutenant, played by Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster.^[143]

  Prisoner of war[edit]

   Further information: Prisoner of war § In popular culture

   [220px-Model_Stalag_Luft_III.jpg] Model of Stalag Luft III used in
   filming The Great Escape (1963)

   A popular subgenre of war films in the 1950s and 1960s was the prisoner
   of war film.^[144] The genre was popularised in Britain with major
   films like Guy Hamilton's The Colditz Story (1955) and John Sturges's
   American film The Great Escape (1963).^[144] They told stories of real
   escapes from German prisoner of war camps such as Stalag Luft III in
   the Second World War. Despite episodes of danger and human tragedy,
   these films delight in a continual boyish game of escape and ingenuity,
   celebrating the courage and the defiant spirit of the prisoners of war,
   and treating war as fun.^[144]^[145]^[146] David Lean's Bridge on the
   River Kwai (1957) was judged best picture at the Oscars; it took the
   genre from chilly German prisons to the heat of a camp in Thailand. It
   was the first, too, to use lush colour to bring out the British stiff
   upper lip of the colonel, played by Alec Guinness in an Oscar-winning
   performance.^[144] The "definitive" Oscar-winning prisoner of war film
   was Billy Wilder's Stalag 17 (1953), while the brief but powerful
   prison camp scenes of The Deer Hunter (1978) lend an air of tragedy to
   the whole of that film.^[144]

  Comedy[edit]

   [140px-Shoulder_Arms_poster.jpg] First military comedy: Charlie
   Chaplin's Shoulder Arms (1918)

   Further information: Comedy film § Military comedy

   Charlie Chaplin's Shoulder Arms (1918) set a style for war films to
   come, and was the first comedy about war in film history.^[147]^[148]

   British cinema in the Second World War marked the evacuation of
   children from London with social comedies such as Those Kids from Town
   (1942) where the evacuees go to stay with an earl, while in Cottage to
   Let (1941) and Went the Day Well? (1942) the English countryside is
   thick with spies.^[149] Gasbags (1941) offered "zany, irreverent,
   knockabout" comedy making fun of everything from barrage balloons to
   concentration camps.^[150] Abbott and Costello's Buck Privates (1941)
   was successful in America,^[151] leading to many further wartime
   comedies.^[152]

  Animated[edit]

   [220px-Winsor_McCay_-_The_Sinking_of_the_Lusitania_still_-_Lusitania_to
   rpedoed.jpg] First animated propaganda film: Winsor McCay's The Sinking
   of the Lusitania (1918)

   Winsor McCay's The Sinking of the Lusitania (1918) was a silent First
   World War film. At 12 minutes long, it was the longest animated film
   made at that time. It was probably the first animated propaganda film
   to be made; it remains the earliest serious animated drama that has
   survived.^[153]^[154]^[155] Through World War II, animated propaganda
   shorts remained influential in American cinema. The Walt Disney
   Company, working with the American armed forces, produced 400,000 feet
   of war propaganda films between 1942 and 1945,^[156] including Der
   Fuehrer's Face (1943) and Education for Death (1943).^[157]

   Japanese anime films from the 1960s onwards addressed national memories
   of war. Akira (1988) moves from the atomic destruction of Hiroshima and
   Nagasaki to apocalyptic visions of global conflict; Grave of the
   Fireflies (1988) is elegiac on the effect of war on
   children.^[158]^[159] Barefoot Gen (1983) portrays the bombing of
   Hiroshima through the eyes of a child,^[160] but reviewers consider it
   a less well made film than Grave of the Fireflies with
   "stomach-churning detail" bizarrely paired with crude artwork, giving
   it the look of a "Saturday morning Warner Brothers cartoon".^[161]

  Anti-war[edit]

   Further information: List of anti-war films

   [140px-All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front_%281930_film%29_poster.jpg]
   Anti-war: Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front, 1930

   The anti-war genre began with films about the First World War. Films in
   the genre are typically revisionist, reflecting on past events and
   often generically blended. Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western
   Front (1930) was unquestionably powerful, and an early anti-war film,
   portraying a German point of view; it was the first film (in any genre)
   to win two Oscars, best picture and best director.^[148] Andrew Kelly,
   analysing All Quiet on the Western Front, defined the genre as showing:
   the brutality of war; the amount of human suffering; the betrayal of
   men's trust by incompetent officers. War and anti-war films often prove
   difficult to categorize as they contain many generic ambiguities.^[1]
   While many anti-war films criticize war directly through depictions of
   grisly combat in past wars, some films such as Penn's Alice's
   Restaurant criticized war obliquely by poking fun at such things as the
   draft board.^[162] The number of anti-war films produced in America
   dipped sharply during the 1950s because of McCarthyism and the
   Hollywood blacklist.^[163] The end of the blacklist and the
   introduction of the MPAA rating system marked a time of resurgence for
   films of all type including anti-war films in the States. Robert
   Eberwein names two films as anti-war classics.^[164] The first is Jean
   Renoir's prisoner of war masterpiece^[148] La Grande Illusion (The
   Grand Illusion, 1937). Renoir's critique of contemporary politics and
   ideology celebrates the universal humanity that transcends national and
   racial boundaries and radical nationalism, suggesting that mankind's
   common experiences should prevail above political division, and its
   extension: war.^[165] The second is Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory
   (1957). The critic David Ehrenstein writes that Paths of Glory
   established Kubrick as the "leading commercial filmmaker of his
   generation" and a world-class talent. Ehrenstein describes the film as
   an "outwardly cool/inwardly passionate protest drama about a disastrous
   French army maneuver and the court-martial held in its wake",
   contrasting it with the "classic" All Quiet on the Western Front's
   story of an innocent "unstrung by the horrors of war".^[166]

  Mixed genres[edit]

   Comedy gave scope for satire, and post-war film-makers merged comedy
   and anti-war sentiment in films as varied as Stalag 17 (1953) and Dr
   Strangelove (1964).^[167] Black comedies like Mike Nichols's Catch-22
   (1970), based on Joseph Heller's satirical novel about the Second World
   War, and Robert Altman's MASH (1970), set in Korea, reflected the
   attitudes of an increasingly sceptical public during the Vietnam
   War.^[168]

   Other genres were combined in Franklin J. Schaffner's Patton (1970),
   about real life General George S. Patton, where combat scenes were
   interleaved with commentary about how he waged war, showing good and
   bad sides to a command. It and MASH became the two most profitable
   war/anti-war films made up to that time,^[169] and Patton won seven
   Academy Awards.^[170]

The war years and post-World War II trends

Decline of the Hollywood studios

   During the U.S. involvement in World War II, the Hollywood film
   industry cooperated closely with the government to support its war-aims
   information campaign. Following the declaration of war on Japan, the
   government created a Bureau of Motion Picture Affairs to coordinate the
   production of entertainment features with patriotic, morale-boosting
   themes and messages about the “American way of life,” the nature of the
   enemy and the allies, civilian responsibility on the home front, and
   the fighting forces themselves. Initially unsophisticated vehicles for
   xenophobia and jingoism with titles such as The Devil with Hitler and
   Blondie for Victory (both 1942), Hollywood’s wartime films became
   increasingly serious as the war dragged on (Fritz Lang’s Hangmen Also
   Die, Jean Renoir’s This Land Is Mine, Tay Garnett’s Bataan, all 1943;
   Delmer Daves’s Destination Tokyo, Alfred Hitchcock’s Lifeboat, Lewis
   Milestone’s The Purple Heart, all 1944; Milestone’s A Walk in the Sun,
   1946). In addition to commercial features, several Hollywood directors
   produced documentaries for government and military agencies. Among the
   best-known of these films, which were designed to explain the war to
   both servicemen and civilians, are Frank Capra’s seven-part series Why
   We Fight (1942–44), John Ford’s The Battle of Midway (1942), William
   Wyler’s The Memphis Belle (1944), and John Huston’s The Battle of San
   Pietro (1944). The last three were shot on location and were made
   especially effective by their immediacy.

   (Read Alfred Hitchcock’s 1965 Britannica essay on film production.)

   When World War II ended, the American film industry seemed to be in an
   ideal position. Full-scale mobilization had ended the Depression
   domestically, and victory had opened vast, unchallenged markets in the
   war-torn economies of western Europe and Japan. Furthermore, from 1942
   through 1945, Hollywood had experienced the most stable and lucrative
   three years in its history, and in 1946, when two-thirds of the
   American population went to the movies at least once a week, the
   studios earned record-breaking profits. The euphoria ended quickly,
   however, as inflation and labour unrest boosted domestic production
   costs and as important foreign markets, including Britain and Italy,
   were temporarily lost to protectionist quotas. The industry was more
   severely weakened in 1948, when a federal antitrust suit against the
   five major and three minor studios ended in the “Paramount decrees,”
   which forced the studios to divest themselves of their theatre chains
   and mandated competition in the exhibition sector for the first time in
   30 years. Finally, the advent of network television broadcasting in the
   1940s provided Hollywood with its first real competition for American
   leisure time by offering consumers “movies in the home.”

   The American film industry’s various problems and the nation’s general
   postwar disillusionment generated several new film types in the late
   1940s. Although the studios continued to produce traditional genre
   films, such as westerns and musicals, their financial difficulties
   encouraged them to make realistic small-scale dramas rather than
   fantastic lavish epics. Instead of depending on spectacle and special
   effects to create excitement, the new lower-budget films tried to
   develop thought-provoking or perverse stories reflecting the
   psychological and social problems besetting returning war veterans and
   others adapting to postwar life. Some of the American cinema’s grimmest
   and most naturalistic films were produced during this period, including
   those of the so-called social consciousness cycle, which attempted to
   deal realistically with such endemic problems as racism (Elia Kazan’s
   Gentleman’s Agreement, 1947; Alfred Werker’s Lost Boundaries, 1949),
   alcoholism (Stuart Heisler’s Smash-Up, 1947), and mental illness
   (Anatole Litvak’s The Snake Pit, 1948); the semidocumentary melodrama,
   which reconstructed true criminal cases and was often shot on location
   (Kazan’s Boomerang, 1947; Henry Hathaway’s Kiss of Death, 1947); and
   the film noir, whose dark, fatalistic interpretations of contemporary
   American reality are unique in the industry’s history (Tay Garnett’s
   The Postman Always Rings Twice, 1946; Orson Welles’s The Lady from
   Shanghai, 1947; Jacques Tourneur’s Out of the Past, 1947; Abraham
   Polonsky’s Force of Evil, 1948).

   Film content was next influenced strongly by the fear of communism that
   pervaded the United States during the late 1940s and early ’50s.
   Anticommunist “witch-hunts” began in Hollywood in 1947 when the House
   Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) decided to investigate
   communist influence in movies. More than 100 witnesses, including many
   of Hollywood’s most talented and popular artists, were called before
   the committee to answer questions about their own and their associates’
   alleged communist affiliations. On November 24, 1947, a group of eight
   screenwriters and two directors, later known as the Hollywood Ten, were
   sentenced to serve up to a year in prison for refusing to testify. That
   evening the members of the Association of Motion Picture Producers,
   which included the leading studio heads, published what became known as
   the Waldorf Declaration, in which they fired the members of the
   Hollywood Ten and expressed their support of HUAC. The studios, afraid
   to antagonize already shrinking audiences, then initiated an unofficial
   policy of blacklisting, refusing to employ any person even suspected of
   having communist associations. Hundreds of people were fired from the
   industry, and many creative artists were never able to work in
   Hollywood again. Throughout the blacklisting era, filmmakers refrained
   from making any but the most conservative motion pictures;
   controversial topics or new ideas were carefully avoided. The resulting
   creative stagnation, combined with financial difficulties, contributed
   significantly to the demise of the studio system, although,
   paradoxically, the actions that the studios took between 1952 and 1965,
   including the practice of blacklisting, can be viewed as an attempt to
   halt the industry’s decline.

   War film is serious business. It has been from the beginning, when
   William Wellman’s Wings (1927) became the first World War I romantic
   drama to win an Oscar for best picture. One hundred years later, the
   supply of war films seems inexhaustible and their box-office attraction
   unbroken.

   Adjusted for inflation, Lawrence of Arabia (1962) made US$589.2 million
   and Schindler’s List (1993) US$569.5 million. Michael Bay’s Pearl
   Harbor (2001) grossed US$648.5 million. American Sniper (2015) grossed
   US$590.5 million.

   The war film genre and its fascination remains.

   There we sit, watching generations get wiped out. We see terrifying
   technological inventions like the atomic bomb being dropped on
   Hiroshima. Removed from actual war in time and place, these big-screen
   productions are horrible yet spellbinding at the same time.

   War Horse (2011) is a particularly effective exploration of this
   experience and what it gives to audiences. Steven Spielberg’s film
   tells the story of a young horse and his owner forced from the idyllic
   fields of rural England into the bloody trenches of first world war
   France.

   War Horse illustrates the fragile balance of peace, and how sacrifice
   forms lasting bonds across borders, languages and species, echoing the
   Great War’s hard-won reconciliation process as Europeans bonded over
   grief and common trauma. Spielberg pairs moral guidance and a sense of
   what really matters in life with breathtaking landscape shots and
   fast-paced action sequences.

   But this is only one story and only one way to present war as a noble
   sacrifice to forge unity. There is no standard formula to explain why
   the experience of war continuously attracts millions of viewers. The
   answer is different for each war story, and it is different in each
   nation.

The national war complex

   The first Australian film to win an Academy Award was Damien Parer’s
   documentary of the fighting in New Guinea in 1942. The film garnered a
   Best Documentary Oscar for bringing the immediate experience of
   humanity at war to Australia: the wounded; the anxiety; the young
   soldiers’ fear of death far from home.

   Parer himself was killed in action in 1944 in the Palau archipelago in
   Micronesia. His cinematic legacy is a sobering documentation of
   Australians at war without flagwavers or hyper-masculine action heroes.
   Damien Parer also shot photographs while in New Guinea, including this
   one at a rest spot on the Kokoda Trail. Australian War Memorial

   SBS recently ran a week of war films in the lead-up to ANZAC Day,
   leading with Churchill (2017), which portrays the inner world of
   Britain’s wartime prime minister.

   Downfall (2004) looks at Hitler’s final days barricaded in his Berlin
   Führerbunker. Testament of Youth (2015) is a heart-swollen romance of
   WWI nurse Vera Brittain’s literary memoirs and her calls for pacifism.

   SBS’s War Week included no actual documentary footage like that of
   Parer’s.

   Today, the idea of an authentic representation of war seems less
   appealing to audiences. Marvel Studios broke box-office records all
   over the world with its fantasy battle and sci-fi war film Avengers:
   Endgame (2019). Perhaps too much reality in depicting war, the starkest
   of all modern realities, is simply unbearable. And so the
   re-enchantment of war comes with laser battles and magic gauntlets.

Fact versus fiction

   How we explore war on film has sparked heated debates.

   One argument holds the true horror of war is increasingly obscured by
   technology, Hollywood star power, and clever marketing campaigns.

   The popular HBO documentary television miniseries Band of Brothers
   (2001) and The Pacific (2010) caused controversy among military
   historians who accused the series of endorsing war nostalgia, making
   the audience take sides, and actively shaping collective modern memory
   through re-enacted combat scenes.

   War has been co-opted as an entertainment favourite in countries all
   across the world, allowing audiences to think of it as a metaphor to
   explore issues like sexism or mortality.

   One of the most popular South Korean war films, Jang Hoon’s The Front
   Line (2011), suggests the meaning of life cannot be found in senseless
   wars. The Cave (2019), a war documentary by Syrian director Feras
   Fayyad, shows how a group of female doctors in Ghouta struggle with
   systemic sexism while tending to thousands of the injured.

   Peter Jackson’s They Shall Not Grow Old (2018) drew almost unanimous
   critical acclaim.

   Jackson’s film produces a modern war experience by enhancing
   documentary footage of the first world war. We see the real faces of
   war: they talk, they smoke makeshift cigarettes, they are shellshocked
   victims of their time.

   Jackson used computerised colouration and recordings of veteran
   interviews as voiceovers. He hired forensic lip readers to superimpose
   dialogue on the previously silent combatants’ voices.

   The result is a conflicting truth about war and how its memories grow
   truer and more real before our eyes and in our ears if we want them to,
   rather than feeling safe in the fact those bombastic Hollywood scenes
   on screen can never become our reality.

Children Under Attack

Children are coming under attack in conflicts across the world. We can’t
accept this as a ‘new normal.’

   Around the world, attacks on children continue unabated. The number of
   countries experiencing violent conflict is the highest it has been in
   the last 30 years. The result is that more than 30 million children
   have been displaced by conflict. Many of them are being enslaved,
   trafficked, abused and exploited. Many more are living in limbo,
   without official immigration status or access to education and health
   care. From Afghanistan to Mali, to South Sudan, Yemen and beyond,
   warring parties are flouting one of the most basic rules of war: the
   protection of children.

     Children have become frontline targets. This is a moral crisis of
     our age: We must never accept this as the ‘new normal.’

   To better monitor, prevent, and end attacks against children, the
   United Nations Security Council has identified and condemned six grave
   violations against children in times of war: Killing and maiming of
   children; recruitment or use of children in armed forces and armed
   groups; attacks on schools or hospitals; rape or other grave sexual
   violence; abduction of children; and denial of humanitarian access for
   children. 

   Between 2005 and 2022, more than 315,000 grave violations were verified
   against children, committed by parties to conflict in more than 30
   conflict situations across Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin
   America. The actual number is undoubtedly far higher. 

Stop attacks on children

   Ultimately children need peace to thrive. It is critical for children
   that efforts to end today’s seemingly endless armed conflicts are
   redoubled. But children cannot wait for protection – while wars
   continue, we must never accept attacks against children.

   More than 30 years since the adoption of the Convention on the Rights
   of the Child, and more than 70 years since the four Geneva Conventions
   – the international legal bedrock to protect civilians in war – it is
   time to say “Enough! Stop attacks on children.”
   Read the change agenda

What we can all do to make change happen

   Citizens everywhere can begin by not averting their gaze from
   children’s suffering, because it seems too distant or the politics of
   conflict too complex.

   We must insist to national and international leaders that protecting
   children during armed conflict is the cornerstone of our shared
   humanity.

   We must demand leadership which is prepared to act to prevent attacks
   and violence against children trapped in war zones.

   Governments and all warring parties where conflicts rage must act to
   fulfil their obligations to protect children and enable access to
   specialized response services for children affected by violence.

   Communities in conflict-affected areas must be supported to create
   protective environments for girls and boys.

   Governments who support or who have influence over warring parties must
   use all their influence to insist children are protected according to
   the requirements of international law.

   International peace and security institutions such as the United
   Nations Security Council and regional organizations can do more to
   prioritize the safety and well-being of children trapped in armed
   conflicts.

   The international community can do more to support programmes which
   work to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation, and
   deliver the services needed to help children come through conflict with
   hope for a better future.

   By protecting children from attacks in armed conflict, we keep hope
   alive, we begin to prepare children to shape peaceful futures for
   themselves and their countries. Acting together, we can turn back this
   deadly ‘new normal’ of attacks against children and preserve humanity.

   Children cannot wait. We must act now.

Protecting children from explosive weapons in populated areas

   In conflicts around the world, civilians continue to endure the
   devastating consequences of the use of explosive weapons in populated
   areas (EWIPA). When used in cities, towns and villages, these weapons
   often have effects well beyond their targets. They claim countless
   lives and limbs, cause widespread destruction, and deprive people of
   essential civilian services, such as water and sanitation, electricity,
   health care and education.

   On 18 November 2022, a new political declaration was launched:
   “Strengthening the Protection of Civilians from the Humanitarian
   Consequences Arising from the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated
   Areas.” The declaration, which had been signed by 80 states by 19
   November 2022, sends a strong signal worldwide that harming civilians
   and damaging cities is not a reality we should accept by committing
   signatory States to restrict or refrain from the use of explosive
   weapons in populated areas.

Emergency funding appeal for children

   Today, there are more children in need of humanitarian assistance than
   at any other time since the Second World War. Across the globe,
   children are facing a historic confluence of crises – from conflict and
   displacement to infectious disease outbreaks and soaring rates of
   malnutrition.

   More than 400 million children live in areas under conflict; an
   estimated 1 billion children – nearly half the world’s children – live
   in countries at extreme vulnerability to the impacts of climate change;
   at least 36.5 million children have been displaced from their homes;
   and 8 million children under age 5 across 15 crisis-hit countries are
   at risk of death from severe wasting.

   But the situation is far from hopeless. We know how to reach children
   at greatest risk and in greatest need. Decisive and timely humanitarian
   action can save children’s lives, while also sowing the seeds of future
   development.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Through the Humanitarian Action for Children appeal 2023, UNICEF is
   appealing for US$10.3 billion to reach more than 110 million children
   with humanitarian assistance.

Humanitarian action for children: Goals for 2023

   In 2023, UNICEF and its partners will continue to provide a principled,
   timely, predictable and efficient humanitarian response in line with
   international norms and standards. UNICEF is also working on
   strengthening the resilience of communities and health infrastructure
   to withstand climate hazards, with the aim of better linking its
   humanitarian response to longer-term community resilience and climate
   adaptation.

   Gender equality and inclusive programming: In 2023, UNICEF will
   continue to prioritize gender equity in humanitarian action – from
   preparedness to response and recovery.

   Climate in humanitarian action: While much of the global focus is on
   mitigating climate change risk, investment in adaptation measures is
   required immediately to build resilience in a drastically – and rapidly
   – changing environment. UNICEF’s interventions focus on: (1) scaling up
   climate change adaptation models in global operations; (2) advocating
   and engaging in policy development; and (3) prioritizing
   climate-adaptive preparedness efforts as key elements to ensure timely,
   effective and cost-efficient actions to save lives and build
   resilience.

   Global food and nutrition crises: UNICEF’s goal is to protect and
   promote diets, services and practices that prevent, detect and treat
   child wasting. UNICEF aims to ensure that no child dies from wasting.
   UNICEF will accelerate progress on two interrelated fronts
   simultaneously: (1) reduce the number of children suffering from the
   more severe forms of wasting; (2) increase the number of children with
   severe forms of wasting who access treatment. 👉🏼 Learn more about
   severe wasting

   Public health emergencies: The annual number of outbreaks reported to
   the World Health Organization has increased more than threefold since
   1980. UNICEF is committed to addressing public health emergencies not
   only through emergency coordination and leadership, responding to the
   health threat, but also by working to ensure the continuity of
   essential services.

     Childhood in the war

   07 July 2023

   The war in Ukraine has been lasting for 500 days. Five hundred days of
   fear, danger and a fight for life. Throughout this period, Ukrainian
   children have been left without homes, school, healthcare, and even
   drinking water. Shelters became their playrooms, benches in the metro
   stations replaced their beds, and instead of school bells, they have
   become accustomed to hearing air alarms. This is how hostilities
   deprive Ukrainian children of their childhood.

   The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) insists that children
   should not live in an atmosphere of constant fear and anxiety. The war
   must end so that every child can have the peaceful and happy childhood
   they deserve.

A homeless childhood

   The war in Ukraine that started on February 24 has led to a devastating
   humanitarian crisis, forcing massive migration throughout Ukraine and
   abroad. Almost two-thirds of children in Ukraine have been forced to
   leave their homes.
   Yuliia is a mother of two, and she is one of those parents who were
   forced to flee Kharkiv, while being accompanied by sounds of
   explosions. The family decided to go to Germany and spent almost a week
   on the road. During the journey, Yulia, her 1-year-old daughter, and
   9-year-old son slept on the floor of an industrial building, on a small
   bed in a kindergarten, on a wooden bench, and in the car: “but it’s
   still better than under fire,” Yuliia says.

   Nobody dreams of being a refugee. Neither had Yuliia, but she had been
   dreaming of her own apartment and of travelling with her children to
   the sea. The war crushed their plans. They only want the war to be
   over, so that they would be able to come back to Ukraine.

     “I decided to leave my home and our entire life with only one goal:
     to save my children. And to survive!” says the mother of two.

   84-year-old Valentyn has three grandchildren. Like Yuliia, he spent a
   couple of restless days trying to rescue his family. The retired man
   travelled more than 1,200 kilometers in an old car to bring his son,
   daughter-in-law, three grandchildren, and a red cocker spaniel from the
   front line to the West of Ukraine.

   The family was bent on taking this desperate road after over a month of
   hiding from bombardments in a basement in Zaporizhzhia. They were
   living without any electricity, network connection and on just a small
   amount of food. As soon as the food supplies were depleted, the family
   decided to flee. The man recalls the most horrifying days for his
   family:

     “Seeing the hungry eyes of your children is worse than death”

   84-year-old Valentyn with his grandchildren

   Valentyn’s childhood was spent on the remainders of debris and rubble,
   a legacy of World War II, and he doesn’t want his grandchildren to have
   the same fate. “I used to play with bullets when I was a kid, and I
   don’t want my grandchildren to have the same childhood,” says the
   grandfather, holding his granddaughter in his arms.

A childhood without school and education

   UNICEF warns that the war has threatened education and thus the future
   of children in Ukraine. Around 5.3 million of them face barriers to
   education, including around 3.6 million directly affected by school
   closures. In addition, 2 out of 3 refugee children from Ukraine remain
   excluded from the national education systems of their host countries.

   As a result, children in Ukraine are at risk of losing critical years
   of education and social development. According to the Ministry of
   Education and Science, more than 2,600 schools have been damaged and
   more than 400 destroyed since the beginning of the full-scale war.

   Little Vika was in her first year of school in Avdiivka when the
   full-scale war started.

     “I loved to study in my school. But the war deprived it of me,” the
     girl says.

   She is only 8 years old, but she has already experienced war conditions
   twice: first when she was born in the middle of hostilities in the East
   of Ukraine and then again while packing her schoolbag with explosions
   in the background. She lost her home, and she has no opportunity to
   study.

   Younger children have also lost access to education as a result of the
   war. On February 24, 2022, preschool education institutions in Ukraine
   closed. Some of them resumed their work only in the fall, but the rest
   haven’t been reopened yet. 7-year-old Myroslava speaks of her dream to
   visit her first graduation, which was shattered by the war:

     “This is the dress that I wanted to wear to my kindergarten
     graduation. But it didn’t happen, because the war started”

A childhood spent in shelters

   Families with children were forced to seek shelter because of
   continuous artillery attacks and air bombardments. They were hiding in
   basements, metro stations, underground parking. Cold and dark premises
   unsuitable for living have become home to many Ukrainian children. For
   over a year now, they have been living underground, sometimes without
   access to hot meals, medicine, or education. Many of them started
   dreaming about just seeing sunlight.

   After the outbreak of the war on February 24, the metro in Kharkiv has
   been serving as a shelter for thousands of people who were fleeing
   shelling and bombing outside. 10-year-old Sonya and her mom are among
   them. After the start of the war, they were living in the metro
   carriages for a couple of months.

     “Today, my mom and I went home to take a shower and take some stuff.
     It was terrifying.”

   Sonya, 10

   Danylo was only 4 years old when the full-scale war started in
   Mariupol. The boy, his brother, and his parents spent a month in a
   basement hiding from countless bombardments, having no electricity,
   water, or hope for rescue.

     “There were other children, but I still felt bad in there.
     ​​Everything there was stony and ugly. We had a bed on the floor and
     stones. We had almost no food, nothing. My mom would share a small
     piece of cheese with me”

   Danylo recalls his life in the basement, recalling that his parents
   used to heat his food with candles. Fortunately, the family managed to
   escape from destroyed Mariupol. But the boy is still afraid of the dark
   and loud noises.

Childhood under shelling

   The war in Ukraine deprives Ukrainian children of the most precious
   part of their lives — it takes away their family members. For already
   500 days, children in Ukraine have been under enemy fire. And some of
   them have witnessed the worst — their relatives’ deaths.

     “I took a photo of my mother at the Kramatorsk railway station, and
     this picture became the last photo of her life,” reflects
     13-year-old Katia.

   Along with her sister, mother, and aunt, the girl was under the
   shelling of the Kramatorsk railway station.

   That day, the family was going to move to Vinnytsia because it was too
   dangerous to stay at their home. But her mother died under the shelling
   having not left the town. “These days, I am attending a psychologist
   and other doctors, who help me recover and get through all the awful
   things that have happened. It is still emotionally extremely difficult
   for me,” the girl admits.

   UNICEF Katia, 13

   16-year-old Mykyta has survived a deadly shelling of Bakhmut. “A piece
   of shrapnel stopped a millimeter from my heart,” 16-year-old Mykyta is
   using his fingers to show the actual size of the metal shrapnel, which
   was removed from his chest by medics. About 3 centimeters of iron could
   take his life.

   But having survived the shelling in Bakhmut, he has lost his relatives
   and native home.

     “When you lose your loved one or have your house destroyed, you feel
     such a pain inside that you cannot find a word to describe it,”
     Mykyta wipes his tears away.

   The doctors say he will recover from the shelling. But his mental
   injuries are much more devastating than the physical ones.

Childhood surrounded by mines

   Since the beginning of the full-scale war, Ukrainian children have
   faced the danger of mines and other unexploded ordnance. Child
   casualties usually occur when children pick up explosive devices such
   as hand grenades and fuses, thinking they are toys. 8-year-old
   Vladyslav from Lyman is one of such children.

   He found a bullet near a burnt-out tank abandoned at a railroad
   crossing in Lyman and picked it up.

     “The explosion was massive. I started to bleed and couldn’t feel my
     arm. In the hospital, doctors tried to remove the shrapnel, but they

   After more than 9 years of hostilities in East Ukraine and a year since
   the beginning of the full-scale war on February 24th, Ukraine is one of
   the countries most affected by mines. About 30% of the country’s
   territory is potentially contaminated with unexploded ordnance and
   mines. Mines and other explosive remnants of the war cause the deaths
   and injuries of many children in Ukraine. Furthermore, many Ukrainian
   children have to live with different physiological disabilities for the
   rest of their lives.

   UNICEF continues to respond to the urgent humanitarian needs of
   children and ensure access to medical care, immunization, nutrition,
   education, water, and sanitation and contributes to the provision of
   psychosocial and mental health support. In refugee-hosting countries,
   UNICEF continues to work with governments, municipalities and local
   partners to strengthen national systems that support refugee children
   with quality education, health services and protection.

   In Ukraine, UNICEF has expanded its efforts to support the government
   in inclusive, child-centered, and sustainable recovery by strengthening
   child protection, education, and health. Thanks to UNICEF programs,
   more than 1.8 million children have access to formal and non-formal
   education, including early learning; more than 3.4 million children and
   their caregivers have access to psychological and psychosocial support;
   more than 5.5 million people have access to clean drinking water;
   6,790,642 children and women receive primary health care in
   UNICEF-supported facilities and through UNICEF mobile teams.

The Psychology of War

Why do humans find it so difficult to live in peace?

   Read any book about the history of the World and it’s likely that
   you’ll be left with one overriding impression: that human beings find
   it impossible to live in peace with one another. And just when the
   world appears to be close to another major conflict—the standoff
   between Russia and Ukraine which has been developing over the last few
   days—it seems a good time to ponder why this seems to be the case.

   Books on world history usually begin with the civilizations of Sumer
   and Egypt, which arose around 3,000 BC. From that point until the
   present day, history is little more than a catalog of endless wars.
   Between 1740 and 1897, there were 230 wars and revolutions in Europe,
   and during this time countries were almost bankrupting themselves with
   their military expenditure.

   Warfare actually became slightly less frequent during the nineteenth
   and early twentieth centuries, but this was only because of the awesome
   technological power nations could now utilize, which meant that wars
   were over more quickly. In reality, the death toll from wars rose
   sharply. Whereas only 30 million people died in all the wars between
   1740 and 1897, estimates of the number of dead in the First World War
   range from 5 million to 13 million, and a staggering 50 million people
   died during the Second World War. (Since then, deaths from warfare have
   declined significantly, for reasons I will discuss later.)

   Theories of Warfare

   How can we explain this pathological behavior?

   Evolutionary psychologists sometimes suggest that it’s natural for
   human groups to wage war because we’re made up of selfish genes that
   demand to be replicated. So it’s natural for us to try to get hold of
   resources that help us survive, and to fight over them with other
   groups. Other groups potentially endanger our survival, and so we have
   to compete and fight with them.

   There are also biological attempts to explain war. Men are biologically
   primed to fight wars because of the large amount of testosterone they
   contain, since it is widely believed that testosterone is linked to
   aggression. Violence may also be linked to a low level of serotonin,
   since there is evidence that when animals are injected with serotonin
   they become less aggressive.

   However, these explanations are highly problematic. For example, they
   cannot explain the apparent lack of warfare in early human history, or
   pre-history, and the relative lack of conflict in most traditional
   hunter-gatherer societies. This is a hotly debated issue, and there are
   some scholars and scientists who claim that warfare has always existed
   in human societies.

   However, many archaeologists and anthropologists dispute this, and I
   believe that the evidence is firmly on their side. For example, last
   year the anthropologists Douglas Fry and Patrik Soderberg published a
   study of violence in 21 modern hunter-gatherer groups and found that,
   over the last 200 years, lethal attacks by one group on another were
   extremely rare. They identified 148 deaths by violence amongst the
   groups during this period, and found that the great majority were the
   result of one-on-one conflict, or family feuds. Similarly, the
   anthropologist R. Brian Ferguson has amassed convincing evidence to
   show that warfare is only around 10,000 years old, and only became
   frequent from around 6,000 years ago.

   And one problem biological theories of warfare is that, while they
   might be able to explain specific outbreaks of violence, warfare is
   actually much more than this. Warfare is a highly planned and organized
   activity, mostly conducted and organized in non-violent situations —
   which does not involve a great deal of actual fighting.*

   Psychological Explanations

   The first psychologist to investigate war was William James, who wrote
   the seminal essay "The Moral Equivalent of War" in 1910. Here James
   suggested that warfare was so prevalent because of its positive
   psychological effects, both on the individual and on society as a
   whole.
   Identity Essential Reads

   "Why Do I Still Not Feel Like a Real Adult?"

   The Fragmented Self

   On a social level, war delivers a sense of unity in the face of a
   collective threat. It binds people together—not just the army engaged
   in battle, but the whole community. It brings what James referred to as
   discipline—a sense of cohesion, with communal goals. The "war effort"
   inspires individual citizens (not just soldiers) to behave honorably
   and unselfishly in service of a greater good.

   On an individual level, one of the positive effects of war is that it
   makes people feel more alive, alert, and awake. In James’ words, it
   "redeem[s] life from flat degeneration." It supplies meaning and
   purpose, transcending the monotony of everyday life. As James puts it,
   "Life seems cast upon a higher plane of power." Warfare also enables
   the expression of higher human qualities that often lie dormant in
   ordinary life, such as discipline, courage, unselfishness, and
   self-sacrifice.

   In my book, Back to Sanity, I emphasize two further important factors.
   One obvious factor is the drive to increase wealth, status, and power.
   A major motivation of warfare is the desire of one group of human
   beings—usually governments, but often the general population of a
   country, tribe or ethnic group—to increase their power and wealth. The
   group tries to do this by conquering and subjugating other groups, and
   by seizing their territory and resources.

   Pick almost any war in history and you’ll find some variant of these
   causes: wars to annex new territory, to colonize new lands, to take
   control of valuable minerals or oil, to help build an empire to
   increase prestige and wealth, or to avenge a previous humiliation,
   which diminished a group’s power, prestige, and wealth. The present
   conflict in the Ukraine can be partly interpreted in these terms—the
   result of Russia’s desire to increase its territory and prestige by
   gaining control of the Crimea, and responding to the prestige-weakening
   blow of losing its favored government in the Ukraine.

   Secondly, war is strongly related to group identity. Human beings, in
   general, have a strong need for belonging and identity which can easily
   manifest itself in ethnicism, nationalism, or religious dogmatism. It
   encourages us to cling to the identity of our ethnic group, country or
   religion, and to feel a sense of pride in being British, American,
   White, Black, Christian, Muslim, Protestant or Catholic.

   The problem with this isn’t so much having pride in our identity, but
   the attitude it engenders towards other groups. Identifying exclusively
   with a particular group automatically creates a sense of rivalry and
   enmity with other groups. It creates an "in/out group" mentality, which
   can easily lead to conflict. In fact, most conflicts throughout history
   have been a clash between two or more different identity groups—the
   Christians and Muslims in the Crusades, the Jews and Arabs, Hindus and
   Muslims in India, the Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland,
   the Israelis and Palestinians, the Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians, and so
   on.

   Again, the present conflict in Ukraine is easily interpreted in these
   terms. The dispute over Crimea lies in the fact that most of the
   region’s population identify themselves as ethnically Russian, while
   the ethnic Ukrainians wish to preserve their own independent identity,
   away from Russian influence.

   The issue of empathy is important here too. One of the most dangerous
   aspects of group identity is what psychologists call moral exclusion.
   This happens when we withdraw moral and human rights to other groups
   and deny them respect and justice. Moral standards are only applied to
   members of our own group. We exclude members of other groups from our
   moral community, and it becomes all too easy for us to exploit,
   oppress, and even kill them.

   The Decline of Warfare

   The good news is that since the end of the Second World War — as Steven
   Pinker points out in The Better Angels of Our Nature — there has been a
   steady worldwide decline in the number of deaths due to warfare. In
   Europe, countries that had been in an almost constant state of war with
   one or more of their neighbors for centuries — such as France, Germany,
   Great Britain, Spain, Holland, Poland, Russia — have experienced an
   unprecedentedly long period of peace.

   As Pinker points out, the decades after the Second World War — up till
   the 1980s — saw an increase in intrastate violence in the world as a
   whole, due to a large number of civil wars. But since the 1980s,
   intrastate violence has declined too, so that the last 25-30 years have
   been by far the least war-afflicted in recent history, and we've seen a
   correspondingly low number of casualties.

   There are a number of obvious factors responsible for this increased
   peacefulness — for example, the nuclear deterrent, the growth of
   democracy (making it more difficult for governments to declare war
   against the will of their citizens), the work of international
   peacekeeping forces, and the demise of the Communist Bloc.

   Strange as it may sound at first, perhaps sport is a factor too. Sport
   is a good example of what William James meant by a moral equivalent of
   war — an activity that satisfies similar psychological needs to war,
   and has a similar invigorating and socially-binding effect, but does
   not involve the same degree of violence and devastation. Perhaps it is
   not a coincidence that, over the 75 years of this steady decline in
   conflict, sport has grown correspondingly in popularity.

   Another important factor is interconnection, increased contact between
   people of different nations due to higher levels of international trade
   and travel and (most recently) via the Internet. It is likely that this
   increased interconnection leads to a decline in group identity, and in
   enmity towards other groups. It promotes moral inclusion, an expansion
   of empathy, and makes it less possible for us to perceive different
   groups as ‘other’ to us. It helps us to sense that, even if they appear
   culturally or racially different, all human beings are essentially the
   same as us. I’m certainly not an apologist for globlization, but this
   is one way (possibly the only way) in which it has had a positive
   effect.

   Perhaps, then, as a species, we are slowly beginning to transcend the
   pathology of warfare. Hopefully conflicts such as the present one in
   Ukraine will be seen more and more as aberrations, as group identity
   fades further and a sense of moral inclusion increases. And perhaps
   eventually, if this process continues, the need for social identity
   will fade away to the point that empathy extends indiscriminately, to
   and from all human beings, so that it becomes impossible — even for
   power-greedy governments — to exploit or oppress other groups in
   service of their own desires.

   *There are also environmental explanations for war — such as population
   pressure — which unfortunately I don’t have space to discuss here. See
   my book The Fall for a fuller discussion.

   Psychological warfare (PSYWAR), or the basic aspects of modern
   psychological operations (PsyOp), have been known by many other names
   or terms, including Military Information Support Operations (MISO), Psy
   Ops, political warfare, "Hearts and Minds", and propaganda.^[1] The
   term is used "to denote any action which is practiced mainly by
   psychological methods with the aim of evoking a planned psychological
   reaction in other people".^[2]

   Various techniques are used, and are aimed at influencing a target
   audience's value system, belief system, emotions, motives, reasoning,
   or behavior. It is used to induce confessions or reinforce attitudes
   and behaviors favorable to the originator's objectives, and are
   sometimes combined with black operations or false flag tactics. It is
   also used to destroy the morale of enemies through tactics that aim to
   depress troops' psychological states.^[3]^[4]

   Target audiences can be governments, organizations, groups, and
   individuals, and is not just limited to soldiers. Civilians of foreign
   territories can also be targeted by technology and media so as to cause
   an effect on the government of their country.^[5]

   Mass communication such as radio allows for direct communication with
   an enemy populace, and therefore has been used in many efforts. Social
   media channels and the internet allow for campaigns of disinformation
   and misinformation performed by agents anywhere in the world.^[6]

History[edit]

Early[edit]

   [220px-Alexander_and_Bucephalus_-_Battle_of_Issus_mosaic_-_Museo_Archeo
   logico_Nazionale_-_Naples_BW.jpg] Mosaic of Alexander the Great on his
   campaign against the Persian Empire.

   Since prehistoric times, warlords and chiefs have recognized the
   importance of weakening the morale of their opponents. In the Battle of
   Pelusium (525 BC) between the Persian Empire and ancient Egypt, the
   Persian forces used cats and other animals as a psychological tactic
   against the Egyptians, who avoided harming cats due to religious belief
   and superstitions.

   Currying favor with supporters was the other side of psychological
   warfare, and an early practitioner of this was Alexander the Great, who
   successfully conquered large parts of Europe and the Middle East and
   held on to his territorial gains by co-opting local elites into the
   Greek administration and culture. Alexander left some of his men behind
   in each conquered city to introduce Greek culture and oppress dissident
   views. His soldiers were paid dowries to marry locals^[7] in an effort
   to encourage assimilation.

   Genghis Khan, leader of the Mongolian Empire in the 13th century AD
   employed less subtle techniques. Defeating the will of the enemy before
   having to attack and reaching a consented settlement was preferable to
   facing his wrath. The Mongol generals demanded submission to the Khan
   and threatened the initially captured villages with complete
   destruction if they refused to surrender. If they had to fight to take
   the settlement, the Mongol generals fulfilled their threats and
   massacred the survivors. Tales of the encroaching horde spread to the
   next villages and created an aura of insecurity that undermined the
   possibility of future resistance.^[8]

   Genghis Khan also employed tactics that made his numbers seem greater
   than they actually were. During night operations he ordered each
   soldier to light three torches at dusk to give the illusion of an
   overwhelming army and deceive and intimidate enemy scouts. He also
   sometimes had objects tied to the tails of his horses, so that riding
   on open and dry fields raised a cloud of dust that gave the enemy the
   impression of great numbers. His soldiers used arrows specially notched
   to whistle as they flew through the air, creating a terrifying
   noise.^[9]

   Another tactic favored by the Mongols was catapulting severed human
   heads over city walls to frighten the inhabitants and spread disease in
   the besieged city's closed confines. This was especially used by the
   later^[which?] Turko-Mongol chieftain.

   The Muslim caliph Omar, in his battles against the Byzantine Empire,
   sent small reinforcements in the form of a continuous stream, giving
   the impression that a large force would accumulate eventually if not
   swiftly dealt with.

   During the early Qin dynasty and late Eastern Zhou dynasty in 1st
   century AD China, the Empty Fort Strategy was used to trick the enemy
   into believing that an empty location was an ambush, in order to
   prevent them from attacking it using reverse psychology. This tactic
   also relied on luck, should the enemy believe that the location is a
   threat to them.

   In the 6th century BCE Greek Bias of Priene successfully resisted the
   Lydian king Alyattes by fattening up a pair of mules and driving them
   out of the besieged city.^[10] When Alyattes' envoy was then sent to
   Priene, Bias had piles of sand covered with wheat to give the
   impression of plentiful resources.

   This ruse appears to have been well known in medieval Europe: defenders
   in castles or towns under siege would throw food from the walls to show
   besiegers that provisions were plentiful. A famous example occurs in
   the 8th-century legend of Lady Carcas, who supposedly persuaded the
   Franks to abandon a five-year siege by this means and gave her name to
   Carcassonne as a result.

   During the Granada War, Spanish captain Hernán Pérez del Pulgar
   routinely employed psychological tactics as part of his guerrilla
   actions against the Emirate of Granada. In 1490, infiltrating the city
   by night with a small retinue of soldiers, he nailed a letter of
   challenge on the main mosque and set fire to the alcaicería before
   withdrawing.^[11]

   In 1574, having been informed about the pirate attacks previous to the
   Battle of Manila, Spanish captain Juan de Salcedo had his relief force
   return to the city by night while playing marching music and carrying
   torches in loose formations, so they would appear to be a much larger
   army to any nearby enemy. They reached the city unopposed.^[12]

   During the Attack on Marstrand in 1719, Peter Tordenskjold carried out
   military deception against the Swedes. Although probably apocryphal, he
   apparently succeeded in making his small force appear larger and feed
   disinformation to his opponents, similar to the Operations Fortitude
   and Titanic in World War II.

World War I[edit]

   [170px-James_Bryce.jpg] Lord Bryce led the commission of 1915 to
   document German atrocities committed against Belgian civilians.

   The start of modern psychological operations in war is generally dated
   to World War I. By that point, Western societies were increasingly
   educated and urbanized, and mass media was available in the form of
   large circulation newspapers and posters. It was also possible to
   transmit propaganda to the enemy via the use of airborne leaflets or
   through explosive delivery systems like modified artillery or mortar
   rounds.^[13]

   At the start of the war, the belligerents, especially the British and
   Germans, began distributing propaganda, both domestically and on the
   Western front. The British had several advantages that allowed them to
   succeed in the battle for world opinion; they had one of the world's
   most reputable news systems, with much experience in international and
   cross-cultural communication, and they controlled much of the undersea
   communications cable system then in operation. These capabilities were
   easily transitioned to the task of warfare.

   The British also had a diplomatic service that maintained good
   relations with many nations around the world, in contrast to the
   reputation of the German services.^[14] While German attempts to foment
   revolution in parts of the British Empire, such as Ireland and India,
   were ineffective, extensive experience in the Middle East allowed the
   British to successfully induce the Arabs to revolt against the Ottoman
   Empire.

   In August 1914, David Lloyd George appointed a Member of Parliament
   (MP), Charles Masterman, to head a Propaganda Agency at Wellington
   House. A distinguished body of literary talent was enlisted for the
   task, with its members including Arthur Conan Doyle, Ford Madox Ford,
   G. K. Chesterton, Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling and H. G. Wells. Over
   1,160 pamphlets were published during the war and distributed to
   neutral countries, and eventually, to Germany. One of the first
   significant publications, the Report on Alleged German Outrages of
   1915, had a great effect on general opinion across the world. The
   pamphlet documented atrocities, both actual and alleged, committed by
   the German army against Belgian civilians. A Dutch illustrator, Louis
   Raemaekers, provided the highly emotional drawings which appeared in
   the pamphlet.^[15]

   In 1917, the bureau was subsumed into the new Department of Information
   and branched out into telegraph communications, radio, newspapers,
   magazines and the cinema. In 1918, Viscount Northcliffe was appointed
   Director of Propaganda in Enemy Countries. The department was split
   between propaganda against Germany organized by H.G Wells, and
   propaganda against the Austro-Hungarian Empire supervised by Wickham
   Steed and Robert William Seton-Watson; the attempts of the latter
   focused on the lack of ethnic cohesion in the Empire and stoked the
   grievances of minorities such as the Croats and Slovenes. It had a
   significant effect on the final collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Army
   at the Battle of Vittorio Veneto.^[13]

   Aerial leaflets were dropped over German trenches containing postcards
   from prisoners of war detailing their humane conditions, surrender
   notices and general propaganda against the Kaiser and the German
   generals. By the end of the war, MI7b had distributed almost 26 million
   leaflets. The Germans began shooting the leaflet-dropping pilots,
   prompting the British to develop unmanned leaflet balloons that drifted
   across no-man's land. At least one in seven of these leaflets were not
   handed in by the soldiers to their superiors, despite severe penalties
   for that offence. Even General Hindenburg admitted that
   "Unsuspectingly, many thousands consumed the poison", and POWs admitted
   to being disillusioned by the propaganda leaflets that depicted the use
   of German troops as mere cannon fodder. In 1915, the British began
   airdropping a regular leaflet newspaper Le Courrier de l'Air for
   civilians in German-occupied France and Belgium.^[16]

   At the start of the war, the French government took control of the
   media to suppress negative coverage. Only in 1916, with the
   establishment of the Maison de la Presse, did they begin to use similar
   tactics for the purpose of psychological warfare. One of its sections
   was the "Service de la Propagande aérienne" (Aerial Propaganda
   Service), headed by Professor Tonnelat and Jean-Jacques Waltz, an
   Alsatian artist code-named "Hansi". The French tended to distribute
   leaflets of images only, although the full publication of US President
   Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, which had been heavily edited in the
   German newspapers, was distributed via airborne leaflets by the
   French.^[13]

   The Central Powers were slow to use these techniques; however, at the
   start of the war the Germans succeeded in inducing the Sultan of the
   Ottoman Empire to declare 'holy war', or Jihad, against the Western
   infidels. They also attempted to foment rebellion against the British
   Empire in places as far afield as Ireland, Afghanistan, and India. The
   Germans' greatest success was in giving the Russian revolutionary,
   Lenin, free transit on a sealed train from Switzerland to Finland after
   the overthrow of the Tsar. This soon paid off when the Bolshevik
   Revolution took Russia out of the war.^[17]

World War II[edit]

   Adolf Hitler was greatly influenced by the psychological tactics of
   warfare the British had employed during World War I, and attributed the
   defeat of Germany to the effects this propaganda had on the soldiers.
   He became committed to the use of mass propaganda to influence the
   minds of the German population in the decades to come. By calling his
   movement The Third Reich, he was able to convince many civilians that
   his cause was not just a fad, but the way of their future. Joseph
   Goebbels was appointed as Propaganda Minister when Hitler came to power
   in 1933, and he portrayed Hitler as a messianic figure for the
   redemption of Germany. Hitler also coupled this with the resonating
   projections of his orations for effect.

   Germany's Fall Grün plan of invasion of Czechoslovakia had a large part
   dealing with psychological warfare aimed both at the Czechoslovak
   civilians and government as well as, crucially, at Czechoslovakia's
   allies.^[18] It became successful to the point that Germany gained
   support of UK and France through appeasement to occupy Czechoslovakia
   without having to fight an all-out war, sustaining only minimum losses
   in covert war before the Munich Agreement.

   At the start of the Second World War, the British set up the Political
   Warfare Executive to produce and distribute propaganda. Through the use
   of powerful transmitters, broadcasts could be made across Europe.
   Sefton Delmer managed a successful black propaganda campaign through
   several radio stations which were designed to be popular with German
   troops while at the same time introducing news material that would
   weaken their morale under a veneer of authenticity. British Prime
   Minister Winston Churchill made use of radio broadcasts for propaganda
   against the Germans. Churchill favoured deception; he said "In wartime,
   truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard
   of lies.".^[19]
   [220px-Map_of_Operation_Bodyguard_subordinate_plans.png] Map depicting
   the targets of all the subordinate plans of Operation Bodyguard.

   During World War II, the British made extensive use of deception –
   developing many new techniques and theories. The main protagonists at
   this time were 'A' Force, set up in 1940 under Dudley Clarke, and the
   London Controlling Section, chartered in 1942 under the control of John
   Bevan.^[20]^[21] Clarke pioneered many of the strategies of military
   deception. His ideas for combining fictional orders of battle, visual
   deception and double agents helped define Allied deception strategy
   during the war, for which he has been referred to as "the greatest
   British deceiver of WW2".^[22]

   During the lead-up to the Allied invasion of Normandy, many new tactics
   in psychological warfare were devised. The plan for Operation Bodyguard
   set out a general strategy to mislead German high command as to the
   date and location of the invasion, which was obviously going to happen.
   Planning began in 1943 under the auspices of the London Controlling
   Section (LCS). A draft strategy, referred to as Plan Jael, was
   presented to Allied high command at the Tehran Conference. Operation
   Fortitude was intended to convince the Germans of a greater Allied
   military strength than was the case, through fictional field armies,
   faked operations to prepare the ground for invasion and "leaked"
   misinformation about the Allied order of battle and war plans.

   Elaborate naval deceptions (Operations Glimmer, Taxable and Big Drum)
   were undertaken in the English Channel.^[23] Small ships and aircraft
   simulated invasion fleets lying off Pas de Calais, Cap d'Antifer and
   the western flank of the real invasion force.^[24] At the same time
   Operation Titanic involved the RAF dropping fake paratroopers to the
   east and west of the Normandy landings.
   [220px-DummyShermanTank.jpg] A dummy Sherman tank, used to deceive the
   Germans.

   The deceptions were implemented with the use of double agents, radio
   traffic and visual deception. The British "Double Cross" anti-espionage
   operation had proven very successful from the outset of the war,^[25]
   and the LCS was able to use double agents to send back misleading
   information about Allied invasion plans.^[26] The use of visual
   deception, including mock tanks and other military hardware had been
   developed during the North Africa campaign. Mock hardware was created
   for Bodyguard; in particular, dummy landing craft were stockpiled to
   give the impression that the invasion would take place near Calais.

   The Operation was a strategic success and the Normandy landings caught
   German defences unawares. Continuing deception, portraying the landings
   as a diversion from a forthcoming main invasion in the Calais region,
   led Hitler into delaying transferring forces from Calais to the real
   battleground for nearly seven weeks.^[27]

Vietnam War[edit]

   [170px-Vietnampropaganda.png] "Viet Cong, beware!" – South Vietnam
   leaflets urging the defection of Viet Cong.

   The United States ran an extensive program of psychological warfare
   during the Vietnam War. The Phoenix Program had the dual aim of
   assassinating National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (NLF or Viet
   Cong) personnel and terrorizing any potential sympathizers or passive
   supporters. During the Phoenix Program, over 19,000 NLF supporters were
   killed.^[28] The United States also used tapes of distorted human
   sounds and played them during the night making the Vietnamese soldiers
   think that the dead were back for revenge.

   The Vietcong and their forces also used a program of psychological
   warfare during this war. Trịnh Thị Ngọ([ṯɕïŋ˧ˀ˨ʔ tʰi˧ˀ˨ʔ ŋɔ˧ˀ˨ʔ]; 1931
   – 30 September 2016), also known as Thu Hương and Hanoi Hannah, was a
   Vietnamese radio personality. She made English-language broadcasts for
   North Vietnam directed at United States troops. During the Vietnam War,
   Ngọ became famous among US soldiers for her propaganda broadcasts on
   Radio Hanoi. Her scripts were written by the North Vietnamese Army and
   were intended to frighten and shame the soldiers into leaving their
   posts. She made three broadcasts a day, reading a list of newly killed
   or imprisoned Americans, and playing popular US anti-war songs in an
   effort to incite feelings of nostalgia and homesickness, attempting to
   persuade US GIs that the US involvement in the Vietnam War was unjust
   and immoral.^[29] A typical broadcast began as follows:

     How are you, GI Joe? It seems to me that most of you are poorly
     informed about the going of the war, to say nothing about a correct
     explanation of your presence over here. Nothing is more confused
     than to be ordered into a war to die or to be maimed for life
     without the faintest idea of what's going on.^[30]

   disseminated during the Iraq War. It shows a caricature of Al-Qaeda in
   Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi caught in a rat trap. The caption
   reads "This is your future, Zarqawi".

   The CIA made extensive use of Contra soldiers to destabilize the
   Sandinista government in Nicaragua.^[31] The CIA used psychological
   warfare techniques against the Panamanians by delivering unlicensed TV
   broadcasts. The United States government has used propaganda broadcasts
   against the Cuban government through TV Marti, based in Miami, Florida.
   However, the Cuban government has been successful at jamming the signal
   of TV Marti.

   In the Iraq War, the United States used the shock and awe campaign to
   psychologically maim and break the will of the Iraqi Army to fight.

   In cyberspace, social media has enabled the use of disinformation on a
   wide scale. Analysts have found evidence of doctored or misleading
   photographs spread by social media in the Syrian Civil War and 2014
   Russian military intervention in Ukraine, possibly with state
   involvement.^[32] Military and governments have engaged in
   psychological operations (PSYOP) and informational warfare (IW) on
   social networking platforms to regulate foreign propaganda, which
   includes countries like the US, Russia, and China.^[33]^[34]

   In 2022, Meta and the Stanford Internet Observatory found that over
   five years people associated with the U.S. military, who tried to
   conceal their identities, created fake accounts on social media systems
   including Balatarin, Facebook, Instagram, Odnoklassniki, Telegram,
   Twitter, VKontakte and YouTube in an influence operation in Central
   Asia and the Middle East. Their posts, primarily in Arabic, Farsi and
   Russian, criticized Iran, China and Russia and gave pro-Western
   narratives. Data suggested the activity was a series of covert
   campaigns rather than a single operation.^[35]^[36]

   In operations in the South and East China Seas, both the United States
   and China have been engaged in "Cognitive Warfare", which involves both
   displays of force, staged photographs and sharing of
   disinformation.^[37]^[38]^[39]

   Most modern uses of the term psychological warfare refer to the
   following military methods:
     * Demoralization:
          + Distributing pamphlets that encourage desertion or supply
            instructions on how to surrender.
          + Shock and awe military strategy.
          + Projecting repetitive and disturbing noises and music for long
            periods at high volume towards groups under siege like during
            Operation Nifty Package.
     * Propaganda radio stations, such as Lord Haw-Haw in World War II on
       the "Germany calling" station.
     * Renaming cities and other places when captured, such as the
       renaming of Saigon to Ho Chi Minh City after Communist victory in
       the Vietnam War.
     * False flag events.
     * Terrorism^[40]
     * The threat of chemical weapons.^[41]
     * Information warfare.

   Most of these techniques were developed during World War II or earlier,
   and have been used to some degree in every conflict since. Daniel
   Lerner was in the OSS (the predecessor to the American CIA) and in his
   book, attempts to analyze how effective the various strategies were. He
   concludes that there is little evidence that any of them were
   dramatically successful, except perhaps surrender instructions over
   loudspeakers when victory was imminent. Measuring the success or
   failure of psychological warfare is very hard, as the conditions are
   very far from being a controlled experiment.

   Lerner also divides psychological warfare operations into three
   categories:^[42]^[page needed]
     * White propaganda (omissions and emphasis): Truthful and not
       strongly biased, where the source of information is acknowledged.
     * Grey propaganda (omissions, emphasis and racial/ethnic/religious
       bias): Largely truthful, containing no information that can be
       proven wrong; the source is not identified.
     * Black propaganda (commissions of falsification): Inherently
       deceitful, information given in the product is attributed to a
       source that was not responsible for its creation.

   Lerner says grey and black operations ultimately have a heavy cost, in
   that the target population sooner or later recognizes them as
   propaganda and discredits the source. He writes, "This is one of the
   few dogmas advanced by Sykewarriors that is likely to endure as an
   axiom of propaganda: Credibility is a condition of persuasion. Before
   you can make a man do as you say, you must make him believe what you
   say."^[42]^: 28  Consistent with this idea, the Allied strategy in
   World War II was predominantly one of truth (with certain
   exceptions).^[citation needed]

   In Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes, Jacques Ellul
   discusses psychological warfare as a common peace policy practice
   between nations as a form of indirect aggression. This type of
   propaganda drains the public opinion of an opposing regime by stripping
   away its power on public opinion. This form of aggression is hard to
   defend against because no international court of justice is capable of
   protecting against psychological aggression since it cannot be legally
   adjudicated.

     "Here the propagandists is [sic] dealing with a foreign adversary
     whose morale he seeks to destroy by psychological means so that the
     opponent begins to doubt the validity of his beliefs and
     actions."^[43]^[44]

By country[edit]

China[edit]

   According to U.S. military analysts, attacking the enemy's mind is an
   important element of the People's Republic of China's military
   strategy.^[45]^[46]^[47] This type of warfare is rooted in the Chinese
   Stratagems outlined by Sun Tzu in The Art of War and Thirty-Six
   Stratagems. In its dealings with its rivals, China is expected to
   utilize Marxism to mobilize communist loyalists, as well as flex its
   economic and military muscle to persuade other nations to act in the
   Chinese government's interests. The Chinese government also tries to
   control the media to keep a tight hold on propaganda efforts for its
   people.^[47] The Chinese government also utilizes cognitive warfare
   against Taiwan.^[48]

France[edit]

   The Centre interarmées des actions sur l'environnement is an
   organization made up of 300 soldiers whose mission is to assure to the
   four service arm of the French Armed Forces psychological warfare
   capacities. Deployed in particular to Mali and Afghanistan, its
   missions "consist in better explaining and accepting the action of
   French forces in operation with local actors and thus gaining their
   trust: direct aid to the populations, management of reconstruction
   sites, actions of communication of influence with the population,
   elites and local elected officials". The center has capacities for
   analysis, influence, expertise and instruction.^[49]

Germany[edit]

   In the German Bundeswehr, the Zentrum Operative Kommunikation is
   responsible PSYOP efforts. The center is subordinate to the Cyber and
   Information Domain Service branch alongside multiple IT and Electronic
   Warfare battalions and consists of around 1000 soldiers. One project of
   the German PSYOP forces is the radio station Stimme der Freiheit
   (Sada-e Azadi, Voice of Freedom),^[50] heard by thousands of Afghans.
   Another is the publication of various newspapers and magazines in
   Kosovo and Afghanistan, where German soldiers serve with NATO.

Iran[edit]

   The Iranian government had an operation program to use the 2022 FIFA
   World Cup as a psyop against concurrent people's
   protests.^[51]^[52]^[53]^[54]^[55]

Israel[edit]

   The Israeli government and its military make use of psychological
   warfare. In 2021, Israeli newspaper Haaretz revealed that "Abu Ali
   Express", a popular news page on Telegram and Twitter purportedly
   dedicated to "Arab affairs", was actually run by a Jewish Israeli paid
   consultant to the Israel Defense Forces. The IDF's psyops account had
   been the source of a number of noteworthy reports that were afterwards
   cited by the Israeli and international media. Abu Ali Express was, for
   example, the source for the report that Qatari funds were entering the
   Gaza Strip in suitcases.^[56]

  United Kingdom[edit]

   The British were one of the first major military powers to use
   psychological warfare in the First and Second World Wars. In the
   current British Armed Forces, PsyOps are handled by the tri-service 15
   Psychological Operations Group. (See also MI5 and Secret Intelligence
   Service). The Psychological Operations Group comprises over 150
   personnel, approximately 75 from the regular Armed Services and 75 from
   the Reserves. The Group supports deployed commanders in the provision
   of psychological operations in operational and tactical
   environments.^[57]^[58]

   The Group was established immediately after the 1991 Gulf War,^[59] has
   since grown significantly in size to meet operational
   requirements,^[60] and since 2015 has been one of the sub-units of the
   77th Brigade, formerly called the Security Assistance Group.^[61]

   In June 2015, NSA files published by Glenn Greenwald revealed details
   of the JTRIG group at British intelligence agency GCHQ covertly
   manipulating online communities.^[62] This is in line with JTRIG's
   goal: to "destroy, deny, degrade [and] disrupt" enemies by
   "discrediting" them, planting misinformation and shutting down their
   communications.^[63]

   In March 2019, it emerged that the Defence Science and Technology
   Laboratory (DSTL) of the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) is tendering to
   arms companies and universities for £70M worth of assistance under a
   project to develop new methods of psychological warfare. The project is
   known as the human and social sciences research capability
   (HSSRC).^[64]

   The term psychological warfare is believed to have migrated from
   Germany to the United States in 1941.^[65] During World War II, the
   United States Joint Chiefs of Staff defined psychological warfare
   broadly, stating "Psychological warfare employs any weapon to influence
   the mind of the enemy. The weapons are psychological only in the effect
   they produce and not because of the weapons themselves."^[66] The U.S.
   Department of Defense currently defines psychological warfare as:

     "The planned use of propaganda and other psychological actions
     having the primary purpose of influencing the opinions, emotions,
     attitudes, and behavior of hostile foreign groups in such a way as
     to support the achievement of national objectives."^[67]

   This definition indicates that a critical element of the U.S.
   psychological operations capabilities includes propaganda and by
   extension counterpropaganda. Joint Publication 3–53 establishes
   specific policy to use public affairs mediums to counter propaganda
   from foreign origins.^[68]

   The purpose of United States psychological operations is to induce or
   reinforce attitudes and behaviors favorable to US objectives. The
   Special Activities Center (SAC) is a division of the Central
   Intelligence Agency's National Clandestine Service, responsible for
   Covert Action and "Special Activities". These special activities
   include covert political influence (which includes psychological
   operations) and paramilitary operations.^[69] SAC's political influence
   group is the only US unit allowed to conduct these operations covertly
   and is considered the primary unit in this area.^[69]

   Dedicated psychological operations units exist in the United States
   Army and United States Marine Corps. The United States Navy and the
   193rd Special Operations Wing of the United States Air Force also plans
   and executes limited PSYOP missions. United States PSYOP units and
   soldiers of all branches of the military are prohibited by law from
   targeting U.S. citizens with PSYOP within the borders of the United
   States (Executive Order S-1233, DOD Directive S-3321.1, and National
   Security Decision Directive 130). While United States Army PSYOP units
   may offer non-PSYOP support to domestic military missions, they can
   only target foreign audiences.

   A U.S. Army field manual released in January 2013 states that "Inform
   and Influence Activities" are critical for describing, directing, and
   leading military operations. Several Army Division leadership staff are
   assigned to “planning, integration and synchronization of designated
   information-related capabilities."^[70]

   In September 2022, an audit of covert information warfare took place
   after social media companies identified a suspected U.S. military
   operation.^[71]

   What psychology is common to most, if not all wars? What mindsets lead
   to war?

   Human history is mostly of conflict and war. History teaches many
   lessons, but has few students. It seems that the main fact that humans
   can learn from history is that humans don’t learn from history.

   The cycle seems to be: conflict leading to war, massive damage,
   casualties and costs on all sides, collective statements of ‘never
   again’, followed by a short period of peace, then repeat.

   War seems so much part of the human condition that it is reasonable to
   ask: are humans hard-wired for war? Do genetics drive people to war so
   that their genes can be better reproduced after destroying the genes of
   ‘others’ who compete for resources?

   Many anthropologists and archaeologists have provided evidence that
   human warfare emerged around only 6000 to 10000 years ago. The
   emergence of war coincides with the creation of agrarian systems and
   societies. Organising the mass production of food freed many people
   from the never ending cycle of hunting and gathering. That in turn,
   enabled some people to live off the labour of others; a ‘leadership‘
   class then emerged.

   If wars only began after some people had the free time and the status
   to direct it, that indicates: the desire for war is not hard-wired, or,
   if hard-wired, the desire for war requires that time and resources are
   available for any such genes to be expressed.

   In the last 3000 years there have been few periods without war in
   Europe where richer nations appeared to have the genes, the time and
   resources. However, since the foundation of the forerunner of the EU in
   the aftermath of WWII, (created to prevent war), there have been no
   wars between any members of the EU, despite having the same gene pool,
   and vast time and resources being available. What explains the outbreak
   of nearly 80 years of peace?

   Perhaps people who trade together, work together and make decisions
   together, and have peaceful ways of resolving the inevitable conflicts,
   don’t make war on each other. Possibly where there is shared law, and
   equal access to justice, creating the mechanisms of trust, people
   generally live in peace, despite any minor disagreements. If war were
   hard-wired, and made possible by time and resource availability, such
   trading and cooperation structures as the EU would not prevent war.

   Most civil wars in recent history took place despite all of the above
   apparently being in place. Perhaps, when those systems break down war
   is still possible, or, is even inevitable. For example, when one or
   both parties to a potential civil war are not prepared to accept a
   shared solution, or, there is no mechanism to find, or implement, a new
   mutually acceptable status quo, perhaps war, or the separation of the
   parties in to new countries, is the only way to resolve the conflict.

   That has been the solution to many conflicts. Three example from recent
   history are the former Yugoslavia, East Timor, and Sudan, Africa.
   Indeed, many countries were formed under exactly those circumstances.

   War could be a toxic side effect induced by the type of people who
   enter politics. The characteristics widely thought to be necessary to
   thrive in political systems, are: mendacity, narcissism, and
   psychopathy. Perhaps it is the dysfunctional psychology of many
   political “leaders,” that leads to war; in their attempts to cling to
   power they relinquish any principle, tell any lie, and order any act.

   Anyone who has followed a war either in real time, or in history, will
   have noted the lies that are told, and atrocities committed by both
   sides. ‘Truth is the first casualty of war,’ although often stated as
   truism, is, itself, not true. By the time someone is in a position to
   call for, or order war, truth and integrity have long since been
   accepted as ongoing collateral damage in their quest for power. War
   reveals that mendacity more starkly.

   Some wars are fought over control of or access to resources. Most
   species of animal only kill to eat. Those that kill but do not eat,
   usually do so, only if they are under actual physical threat. Humans
   will kill each other if their ideas are under threat. Many wars are
   fought over political ideology, religion, values, beliefs, governmental
   systems, etc.

   Perhaps ideas, ideologies, can work in a way similar to genes. Could it
   be that humans compete for their ideas to be accepted? Do humans
   conflate personal survival with the acceptance of their ideas? Do
   people need validation so much that they are willing to go to war for
   it? While that may sound irrational, it seems to be so when people
   declare such as: ‘I am willing to kill or die for my beliefs.’ Here is
   an example from the cold war era: ‘I’d rather be dead than Red.’

   Politicians throughout history have directed people to commit murder on
   a huge scale over arbitrary ideas such as ‘countries’. ‘Patriotism is
   the last refuge of scoundrels,’ was said by Winston Churchill, before
   he, too, took refuge in the idea of ‘country’.

   Since few people are prepared to harm anyone, let alone those who are
   just like them, it is necessary for politicians who wish war to
   ‘otherise’; to create an enemy, to spin that enemy as an existential
   threat to their people, to their way of life, to their ideas.

   The horrors of war are only possible if decent people can be convinced
   to murder; if they become the ‘Universal Soldier’, (as so well
   explained in the song by that name by Buffy Sainte-Marie). The process
   is started slowly, reasonably; the ‘other’ is contrasted with how
   civilised and honourable ‘we are’, Then, gradually the ‘other’ is
   demonised, and dehumanised. Once the newly minted ‘universal soldier’
   is convinced that the ‘other’ is deserving of their fate, they will
   happily commit any atrocity ordered; their targets have foregone their
   human rights; they are the subjects of moral exclusion.

   The brainwashing process of preparing a people for war is the same one
   that is used by cult leaders to disparage non-cult members, and keep
   cult members under control.

   Many other psychological factors are involved in war. Here are just
   some:

Revenge

   War based on revenge has has been present in several parts of the world
   for millennia. Each party seeks “justice” for the last “injustice”
   imposed on them, and in so doing they impose another injustice, and the
   cycle continues, often for generations.

Fear

   Humans have, over and over again, gone to war, for fear of being
   attacked. That is, fear of war creates war. Countless lives have been
   lost in ‘pre-emptive’ attacks to ‘defend’ against a threat that was
   utterly baseless. Repeatedly,  peoples have been manipulated by
   politicians to attack before they are attacked, when no such attack was
   intended or possible.

Hypocrisy

   Each party involved feels their war is ‘just’, in various forms:
   defending their country, their way of life, their resources, their
   morality. Each can justify fighting a war with their righteous
   indignation, but their enemies are condemned for thinking and acting in
   exactly the same way.

Heroising

   When leaders of the past are lauded as ‘great’ for having led the mass
   murder of their ‘enemies’, the egos of leaders in the present are
   tempted to write their place in history via war. What kind of person is
   prepared to authorise the massacre of millions to make themself
   ‘immortal’? A psychopath. The history and psychology of war seems to be
   the history and psychology of psychopaths.

Logic justifies emotion

   Most of us like to think we are rational and logical, that our emotions
   follow our logical analyses. Alas, we are not. It is the other way
   around: our logic is used to justify our emotions. Even the most base
   of emotions can be justified with logic, in very predictable ways:

   ‘We don’t like [insert name of the “other”]. They are [insert wild
   imagined threats]. They are [insert baseless accusation of horrible
   characteristics]. We should [insert call to damage the “other”] to save
   ourselves, from them.’

“God is on our side”

   War after war has been fought in the name of religion, or justified
   using religion. Both sides use the same justifications and/or claim
   religious validation for breaking their legal and religious principles
   (for example, not to kill). Religion is co-opted and corrupted by
   politicians, and used to ‘justify’ war.

The first act of any organisation

   Organisations, like living systems, immediately they come into
   existence, set about protecting their existence. Arbitrary concepts
   such as groups, companies, and countries, seek to protect themselves,
   even if that means that all real and actual living members or citizens
   are annihilated. Governments have massacred their own people too in the
   name of ‘the party’.

Group think

   When a group of people comes together, they quickly adopt shared norms.
   If the group has been pre-selected for their shared view of the world,
   those norms have no means of being challenged. Any and all information
   which a rational, objective person could see would challenge the
   group’s dysfunctional thinking, is reinterpreted by the group as
   evidence to support their thinking. Such delusional reinterpretation of
   reality is common in many mental disorders. When those in power are
   gripped by group think, it can quickly start and continue the madness
   of war.

There are no winners

   War almost always emerges as a result of a toxic cocktail of
   dysfunctional psychology. It matters not which side has the most
   delusional thinking, there are no winners in war, only greater or
   lesser losers.

   The people who fight wars are the youngest, fittest, and strongest,
   huge numbers of whom are killed in battle. The gene pool is diminished
   for all. After WWI, vast numbers of women could find no husband, and
   had no children.

   Vast numbers of the soldiers involved in a war have their lives ruined
   by post traumatic stress injury. They suffer nightmares for life, their
   relationships are impaired, holding down a normal career is difficult,
   depression, anxiety, alcoholism, unemployment, homelessness, and
   suicide are all higher in those unlucky enough to have seen the reality
   of war.

   Few peoples have avoided paying massive costs for going to war. Are the
   costs of directing a country to go to war borne by those who direct it?
   No. Political systems seem to immunise those who start wars from the
   consequences of their decisions. Perhaps that immunity makes them more
   likely to lay down the lives of others, to protect or enhance their own
   lives and positions.

Britain: The Psychology of War

   The War That Changed the World
   [ ]

   What did the world’s first industrial war do to the minds of people who
   fought in it? Amanda Vickery explores the mental motivations and
   psychological impacts of World War One.
   Show more

   One hundred years ago World War One set the course for the twentieth
   century; for the countries that took part nothing would be the same
   again. In this worldwide series of events with the British Council, we
   look at the impact of the war from around the world.

   The third debate of the series comes from The Imperial War Museum in
   London as we explore the psychology of war. What drove men to volunteer
   for the war? What drove them to the edge of sanity when they got there?

   Historian and broadcaster Amanda Vickery is joined by a panel of
   experts and a live audience to explore the mental impact of fighting
   the war at home and abroad. World War One experts Dan Todman (Queen
   Mary, University of London) and Michael Roper (University of Essex) are
   joined by the celebrated cultural historian, Joanna Bourke (Birkbeck,
   University of London), who presents her specially commissioned essay,
   Shell Shock and the Shock of Shells.

Ukraine war: Why Kyiv's Dnipro east bank gain could be significant

   By Jenny Hill
   BBC News, Ukraine

   Ukrainian fighters on the front line say troops have not only crossed
   into Russian occupied territory but held a position, apparently for the
   first time, on the fiercely defended east (or left) bank of the Dnipro
   River in Kherson region.

   The development is potentially significant. Ukraine's counteroffensive
   aims to slice through Russian occupied territory, severing a land
   corridor to the Crimean peninsula which Moscow annexed - illegally - in
   2014.

   In a text exchange, the 46th brigade told the BBC that troops were
   engaged in heavy fighting as they try to take full control of the
   village of Krynky.

   If successful, the force said, the settlement would give advanced units
   a base from which to launch a larger offensive aimed at dividing
   Russian troops and cutting off their supply lines.

   The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that Ukrainian
   forces were continuing larger than usual ground operations on the east
   bank and Russian military bloggers have also noted fighting in Krynky.

   And the action is being closely scrutinised - success here would be
   seized upon by Ukraine's military chiefs. Their counteroffensive,
   launched in June, has made slow progress, with limited territorial
   gains.

     * Biden seeks 'vital' war aid for Israel and Ukraine

   But the fighters we spoke to acknowledged that, even if the troops were
   to take Krynky, a modern day "Normandy landings" style attack was
   unlikely.

   And they gave us a glimpse of the dangers and challenges they face,
   particularly as winter approaches.

   The 46th brigade is fighting further along the vast front line in the
   Zaporizhzhia region with the same aim in mind - to cut off Russian
   access to the Crimean peninsula.

   They told us they had just managed to partially breach the first line
   of Russian defence near the village of Verbove - and that they'd
   successfully targeted some ammunition depots and bases, but that
   progress was limited.

   They described heavily mined Russian fortifications and daily air
   attacks on their logistics routes without, they complained, air support
   of their own.

   Russian troops, they said, had been on the defensive but were now on
   the attack.

   And, as winter approaches, conditions are deteriorating - for both
   sides.

   Rainy weather is affecting the work of drones, reconnaissance equipment
   and aviation, the soldiers said. But they did not anticipate any let-up
   in the fighting.

   "Winter will not be a time for respite," they said.

   Zelensky: Thousands of children abducted by Russia
   By James Landale in New York &amp; Jaroslav Lukiv in London
   BBC News

   "Evil cannot be trusted," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has
   told the UN General Assembly, as he urged the world to unite to end
   Russian aggression against his country.

   In a passionate speech in New York, Mr Zelensky said a nuclear-armed
   Moscow must be stopped from "pushing the world to the final war".

   He also accused Russia of weaponising everything from food to energy.

   Russia's full-scale invasion has prompted widespread condemnation.

   In a speech which focused heavily on the danger Russia poses to the
   world, he argued that other common challenges such as climate change
   can only be properly addressed after Moscow had been pushed back.

   "While Russia is pushing the world to the final war, Ukraine is doing
   everything to ensure that after the Russian aggression no-one in the
   world will dare to attack any nation," Mr Zelensky said to world
   leaders attending the annual General Assembly.

   He also said Russia simply had "no right to hold nuclear weapons".

   "Weaponisation must be restrained, war crimes must be punished,
   deported people must come back home, and the occupier must return to
   their own land.

   "We must be united to make it, and we will do it!" Mr Zelensky said.

   He also accused Moscow of carrying out "genocide" by abducting
   Ukrainian children.

   In March, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest
   warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the alleged unlawful
   deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia.

   Moscow has repeatedly denied Ukraine's accusations - but a number
   international experts and organisations point to a growing evidence
   that Russia has committed war crimes in Ukraine.

   The Ukrainian president went on to warn against "shady deals" to try to
   end the war - the biggest in Europe since World War Two - on unfair
   terms.

   But his key point was to warn the international community that the
   outcome of the war would affect everyone.

   Russia's goal, he said, was to turn Ukraine into "a weapon against you,
   against the rules-based international order".

   The peace formula that he had been outlining for months was, he said,
   not just for Ukraine, but also the rest of the world.

   So the pitch was clear and aimed squarely at countries - many of them
   in the so-called "Global South" including Brazil and India - which have
   thus far stayed on the sidelines.

   A number of nations have even strengthened their economic ties with the
   Kremlin.

   Western powers have been rushing around the UN trying to address those
   countries' wider concerns about development issues and climate change.

   Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian leader applauded Joe Biden's speech,
   in which his US counterpart warned of grave consequences if Russia's
   aggression was not stopped.

   "Russia believes that the world will grow weary and allow it to
   brutalise Ukraine without consequence. If we allow Ukraine to be carved
   up, is the independence of any nation secure?" Mr Biden said.

   Meanwhile, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi - whose country has provided
   combat drones to Russia and is seen as Moscow's key ally - accused
   Washington of escalating the war in Ukraine.

   "The United States of America has fanned the flames of violence in
   Ukraine in order to weaken the European countries. This is a long-term
   plan, unfortunately," he told the gathering in New York.

Russia’s Strategic Failure and Ukraine’s Secure Future

   Speech

   Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State

   Helsinki City Hall

   Helsinki, Finland

   June 2, 2023

   MAYOR VARTIAINEN:  Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, dear
   friends, it is my great pleasure to warmly welcome you all to the
   beautiful capital of Finland, Helsinki, and the Helsinki City Hall.
   Helsinki has a great honor to host this special event today.  We are
   humbled and in great appreciation to have the U.S. Secretary of State
   Antony J. Blinken here in Helsinki.

   Helsinki is a city where the harmonious blend of history, innovation,
   freedom, and diplomacy converges.  Our capital is and has been an arena
   for numerous high-level meetings and political events, and we are proud
   to provide the platform for this historical moment, now for the first
   time as the proud capital of a new NATO Ally.

   Now it is my great pleasure to introduce you the co-organizer of the
   event, Dr. Mika Aaltola, the director of the Finnish Institute of
   International Affairs.  Thank you.  (Applause.)

   MR AALTOLA:  Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, this is a truly
   historical day.  It is the first time that a United States secretary of
   state stands on the solid granite ground of NATO Finland.  Secretary
   Blinken’s visit represents a new era in the Finnish-U.S. relations that
   have long historical ties.  Never before have the relations between our
   two countries been this close.

   In addition to now being NATO Allies, Finland and the United States are
   working together to enhance our bilateral defense cooperation.  Also,
   economic cooperation has increased significantly as the U.S. became
   Finland’s number one trade partner last year.

   While physically separated by an ocean, our countries are bound by ties
   that surpass distance.  We face common security challenges, but even
   more importantly, we share a belief in democracy, in our common values
   and shared interests.

   These values are being challenged by Russia’s brutal invasion of
   Ukraine.  With the level of economic and military support it has
   offered to Ukraine, the United States remains the indispensable force
   in Europe.  The U.S. was already awake when most of Europe was still
   sleeping, relatively undisturbed by Russia’s power political gaming.
   U.S. leadership is as needed as ever.

   This leadership helps to keep doors open and enemies at bay, but there
   would be no leadership without a partnership.  This partnership is
   something that Finland has offered to the United States.  Finland is an
   able ally and a security provider.  We carry our responsibilities in
   our region and beyond, and we are committed to support Ukraine and to
   defend ourselves and the values we stand for.  This commitment is
   shared by the Finnish leadership but, even more importantly, by the
   Finnish people.

   Finland has ranked as the least corrupt, most egalitarian, one of the
   most educated, and most democratic countries in the world.  It also is
   the most stable country in the world.  In these volatile times, this
   stability has a value of its own.  Surprisingly for many Finns, Finland
   is also the happiest country in the world.  We question this result
   every year, but it is pointed to us that it is the case.  It is a fact,
   so how miserable others must be if we are the happiest.  (Laughter.)

   But now I’m truly happy to be able to welcome on the stage with United
   States Secretary of State Mr. Antony Blinken.  (Applause.)

   SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  And yes, I feel a
   greater sense of happiness today than I’ve felt in a long time.
   (Laughter.)

   Mayor Vartiainen, thank you for hosting us here in Helsinki, and in
   this absolutely magnificent city hall.

   And Mika, my thanks to you, and also to your entire team – all of the
   researchers at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, for
   deepening the scholarship about diplomacy, and also enriching the
   public debate.

   I’m also gratified that my friend and my partner, Pekka Haavisto, is
   here with us today.  We have worked so closely together over this past
   truly historic year, and I’m grateful for your presence.

   To all of the distinguished guests, two months ago, I stood with our
   Allies in Brussels as Finland’s flag was raised over NATO headquarters
   for the first time.  President Niinistö declared, and I quote, “The era
   of military nonalignment in Finland has come to an end.  A new era
   begins.”

   It was a sea change that would have been unthinkable a little more than
   a year earlier.  Before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, one in
   four Finns supported the country joining NATO.  After the full-scale
   invasion, three in four Finns supported joining.

   It wasn’t hard for Finns to imagine themselves in the Ukrainians’
   shoes.  They’d walked in them in November 1939, when the Soviet Union
   invaded Finland.

   Like President Putin’s so-called “special operation” against Ukraine,
   the USSR’s so-called “liberation operation” falsely accused Finland of
   provoking the invasion.

   Like the Russians with Kyiv, the Soviets were confident that they’d
   sack Helsinki in weeks – so confident that they had Dmitri Shostakovich
   compose music for the victory parade, before the Winter War even
   started.

   Like Putin in Ukraine, when Stalin failed to overcome the Finns’ fierce
   and determined resistance, he shifted to a strategy of terror,
   incinerating entire villages and bombing so many hospitals from the air
   that Finns started covering up the Red Cross insignia on the rooftops.

   Like the millions of Ukrainian refugees today, hundreds of thousands of
   Finns were driven from their homes by the Soviet invasion.  They
   included two children, Pirkko and Henri, whose families evacuated their
   homes in Karelia – the mother and father of our host, the mayor of the
   city.

   To many Finns, the parallels between 1939 and 2022 were striking.  They
   were visceral.  And they were not wrong.

   Finns understood that if Russia violated the core principles of the UN
   Charter – sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence – if they
   did that in Ukraine, it will imperil their own peace and security as
   well.

   We understood that, too.  That’s why, over the course of 2021, as
   Russia ratcheted up its threats against Kyiv and amassed more and more
   troops, tanks, and planes on Ukraine’s borders, we made every effort to
   get Moscow to de-escalate its manufactured crisis and resolve its
   issues through diplomacy.

   President Biden told President Putin that we were prepared to discuss
   our mutual security concerns – a message that I reaffirmed repeatedly –
   including in person, with Foreign Minister Lavrov.  We offered written
   proposals to reduce tensions.  Together with our allies and partners,
   we used every forum to try to prevent war, from the NATO-Russia Council
   to the OSCE, from the UN to our direct channels.

   Across these engagements, we set out two possible paths for Moscow: a
   path of diplomacy, which could lead to greater security for Ukraine,
   for Russia, for all of Europe; or a path of aggression, which would
   result in severe consequences for the Russian Government.

   President Biden made clear that regardless of which path President
   Putin chose, we would be ready.  And if Russia chose war, we would do
   three things: support Ukraine, impose severe costs on Russia, and
   strengthen NATO while rallying our allies and partners around these
   goals.

   As the storm clouds gathered, we surged military, economic, and
   humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.  First in August 2021, and again in
   December, we sent military equipment to bolster Ukraine’s defenses,
   including Javelins and Stingers.  And we deployed a team from the U.S.
   Cyber Command to help Ukraine shore up its power grid and other
   critical infrastructure against cyber attacks.

   We prepared an unprecedented set of sanctions, export controls, other
   economic costs to impose severe and immediate consequences on Russia in
   the event of a full-scale invasion.

   We took steps to leave no doubt that we, and our Allies, would uphold
   our commitment to defend every inch of NATO territory.

   And we worked relentlessly to rally allies and partners around helping
   Ukraine defend itself and denying Putin his strategic aims.

   Since day one of his administration, President Biden has focused on
   rebuilding and revitalizing America’s alliances and partnerships,
   knowing that we’re stronger when we work alongside those who share our
   interests and our values.

   In the run-up to Russia’s invasion, we demonstrated the power of those
   partnerships – coordinating our planning and strategy for a potential
   invasion with NATO, with the EU, with the G7, and other allies and
   partners from around the world.

   Over those fateful weeks in January and February of 2022, it became
   clear that no amount of diplomatic effort was going to change President
   Putin’s mind.  He would choose war.

   And so, on February 17, 2022, I went before the United Nations Security
   Council to warn the world that Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine
   was imminent.

   I set out the steps that Russia would take:  first manufacturing a
   pretext, and then using missiles, tanks, troops, cyber attacks to
   strike pre-identified targets, including Kyiv, with the aim of toppling
   Ukraine’s democratically elected government and erasing Ukraine from
   the map as an independent country.

   We hoped – we hoped – to be proven wrong.

   Unfortunately, we were right.  A week after my warning to the Security
   Council, President Putin invaded.  Ukrainians of all walks of life –
   soldiers and citizens, men and women, young and old – bravely defended
   their nation.

   And the United States moved swiftly, decisively, and in unison with
   allies and partners to do exactly what we said we’d do: support
   Ukraine, impose costs on Russia, strengthen NATO – all of this with our
   allies and partners.

   And with our collective support, Ukraine did what it said it would do:
   defended its territory, its independence, its democracy.

   Today, what I want to do is set out this and the many other ways
   Putin’s war of aggression against Ukraine has been a strategic failure,
   greatly diminishing Russia’s power, its interests, and its influence
   for years to come.  And I’ll also share our vision of the path to a
   just and lasting peace.

   When you look at President Putin’s long-term strategic aims and
   objectives, there is no question:  Russia is significantly worse off
   today than it was before its full-scale invasion of Ukraine –
   militarily, economically, geopolitically.

   Where Putin aimed to project strength, he’s revealed weakness.  Where
   he sought to divide, he’s united.  What he tried to prevent, he’s
   precipitated.  That outcome is no accident. It’s the direct result of
   the courage and solidarity of the Ukrainian people and the deliberate,
   decisive, swift action that we and our partners have taken to support
   Ukraine.

   First, for years, President Putin sought to weaken and divide NATO,
   under the false claim that it posed a threat to Russia.  In fact,
   before Russia invaded Crimea and eastern Ukraine in 2014, NATO’s
   posture reflected a shared conviction that conflict in Europe was
   unlikely.  The United States had significantly reduced its forces in
   Europe since the end of the Cold War, from 315,000 in 1989 to 61,000 at
   the end of 2013.  Many European countries’ spending on defense had been
   declining for years.  NATO’s strategic doctrine at the time labeled
   Russia a partner.

   Following Russia’s invasion of Crimea and the Donbas in 2014, that tide
   began to turn.  Allies committed to spend two percent of GDP on defense
   and deployed new forces to NATO’s eastern flank in response to Russia’s
   aggression.   The Alliance has accelerated its transformation since
   Russia’s full-scale invasion – not to pose a threat or because NATO
   seeks conflict.  NATO always has been – and always will be – a
   defensive alliance.  But Russia’s aggression, threats, nuclear
   saber-rattling compelled us to reinforce our deterrence and defense.

   Hours after the full-scale invasion, we activated NATO’s defensive
   Response Force. In the weeks that followed, several Allies – including
   the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, France –
   swiftly sent troops, aircraft, and ships to reinforce NATO’s eastern
   flank.  We doubled the number of ships patrolling the North and Baltic
   seas, and doubled the number of battle groups in the region.  The
   United States established its first permanent military presence in
   Poland.  And, of course, NATO added Finland as its 31st Ally, and we
   will soon add Sweden as the 32nd.

   As we head into the NATO Summit in Vilnius, our shared message will be
   clear:  NATO Allies are committed to enhanced deterrence and defense,
   to greater and smarter defense spending, to deeper ties with
   Indo-Pacific partners.  NATO’s door remains open to new members, and it
   will stay open.

   Russia’s invasion has also led the European Union to do more – and more
   together with the United States and with NATO – than ever before.  The
   EU and its member-states have provided over $75 billion in military,
   economic, humanitarian support to Ukraine.  That includes $18 billion
   in security assistance, from air defense systems to Leopard tanks to
   ammunition.  Coordinating closely with the U.S., the U.K., and other
   partners, the EU has launched its most ambitious sanctions ever,
   immobilizing over half of Russia’s sovereign assets.  And European
   nations have taken in more than 8 million Ukrainian refugees, most of
   whom have not only been granted access to public services, but also the
   right to work, to study.

   Second, for decades, Moscow worked to deepen Europe’s dependence on
   Russian oil and gas.  Since President Putin’s full-scale invasion,
   Europe has made a swift and decisive turn away from Russian
   energy.  Berlin immediately canceled Nord Stream 2, which would have
   doubled the flow of Russian gas to Germany.

   Before Putin’s invasion, European countries imported 37 percent of
   their natural gas from Russia.  Europe cut that by more than half in
   less than a year.  In 2022, EU countries generated a record one-fifth
   of their electricity through wind and solar – more electricity than the
   EU generated through coal, gas, or any other power source.  The United
   States for its part more than doubled our supply of gas to Europe, and
   our Asian allies – Japan, the Republic of Korea – also stepped up to
   boost Europe’s supply.

   Meanwhile, the oil price cap that we and our G7 partners put in place
   has kept Russia’s energy in the global market, while dramatically
   cutting Russian revenues.  A year into its invasion, Russia’s oil
   revenues had fallen by 43 percent.  The Russian Government’s tax
   revenues from oil and gas have fallen by nearly two-thirds.  And Moscow
   will not get back the markets that it has lost in Europe.

   Third, President Putin spent two decades trying to build Russia’s
   military into a modern force, with cutting-edge weaponry, streamlined
   command, and well-trained, well-equipped soldiers.  The Kremlin often
   claimed it had the second-strongest military in the world, and many
   believed it.  Today, many see Russia’s military as the second-strongest
   in Ukraine.  Its equipment, technology, leadership, troops, strategy,
   tactics, and morale, a case study in failure – even as Moscow inflicts
   devastating, indiscriminate, and gratuitous damage on Ukraine and
   Ukrainians.

   Russia is estimated to have suffered more than 100,000 casualties in
   the last six months alone, as Putin sends wave after wave of Russians
   into a meat grinder of his own making.

   Meanwhile, sanctions and export controls imposed by the United States,
   the European Union, and other partners around the world have severely
   degraded Russia’s war machine and defense exports, setting them back
   for years to come.  Russia’s global defense partners and customers can
   no longer count on promised orders, let alone spare parts.  And as they
   witness Russia’s poor performance on the battlefield, they are
   increasingly taking their business elsewhere.

   Fourth, President Putin wanted to build Russia up as a global, economic
   power.  His invasion cemented his long-running failure to diversify
   Russia’s economy, to strengthen its human capital, to fully integrate
   the country into the global economy.  Today, Russia’s economy is a
   shadow of what it was, and a fraction of what it could have become had
   Putin invested in technology and innovation rather than weapons and
   war.

   Russia’s foreign reserves are down by more than half, as are profits
   from its state-owned enterprises.  More than 1,700 foreign companies
   have reduced, suspended, or ended operations in Russia since the onset
   of the invasion.  That’s tens of thousands of jobs gone, a massive
   flight of foreign expertise, and billions of dollars in lost revenue
   for the Kremlin.

   A million people have fled Russia, including many of the country’s top
   IT specialists, entrepreneurs, engineers, doctors, professors,
   journalists, scientists.  Countless artists, writers, filmmakers,
   musicians have also left, seeing no future for themselves in a country
   where they can’t express themselves freely.

   Fifth, President Putin invested considerable effort to show that Russia
   could be a valued partner to China.  On the eve of the invasion,
   Beijing and Moscow declared a “no limits” partnership.  Eighteen months
   into the invasion, that two-way partnership looks more and more
   one-sided.  Putin’s aggression and weaponization of strategic
   dependencies on Russia has served as a wake-up call to governments
   around the world to make efforts at de-risking.  And together, the
   United States and our partners are taking steps to reduce those
   vulnerabilities, from building more resilient critical supply chains to
   strengthening our shared tools to counter economic coercion.

   So, Russia’s aggression hasn’t distracted us from meeting the
   challenges in the Indo-Pacific.  It’s actually sharpened our focus on
   them.  And our support for Ukraine hasn’t weakened our capabilities to
   meet potential threats from China or anywhere else – it’s strengthened
   them. And we believe that Beijing is taking notice that, far from being
   intimidated by a forceful violation of the UN Charter, the world has
   rallied to defend it.

   Sixth, prior to the war, President Putin regularly used Russia’s
   influence in international organizations to try to weaken the United
   Nations Charter.  Today, Russia is more isolated on the world stage
   than ever.  At least 140 nations – two-thirds of UN member-states –
   have repeatedly voted in the UN General Assembly to affirm Ukraine’s
   sovereignty and territorial integrity, to reject Putin’s attempts to
   illegally annex Ukrainian territory, to condemn Russia’s aggression and
   atrocities, and to call for a peace consistent with the principles of
   the United Nations Charter.  Governments from the West and East, North
   and South have voted to suspend Russia from numerous institutions, from
   the UN Human Rights Council to the International Civil Aviation
   Organization.  Russian candidates have lost one election after another
   for key seats in international institutions, from the governing board
   of UNICEF to leadership of the UN agency responsible for information
   and communication technologies, the ITU.

   Each rebuke and loss for Moscow is not only a vote against Russia’s
   aggression, it’s a vote for the core principles of the United Nations
   Charter.   And countries from every part of the world are supporting
   efforts to hold Russia accountable for its war crimes and crimes
   against humanity, from creating a special UN commission to document the
   crimes and human rights violations committed in Russia’s war to
   assisting investigations by prosecutors in Ukraine and at the
   International Criminal Court.

   Seventh, President Putin, for years, sought to divide the West from the
   rest, claiming that Russia was advancing the best interests of the
   developing world.   Today, thanks to openly declaring his imperial
   ambitions and weaponizing food and fuel, President Putin has diminished
   Russian influence on every continent.  Putin’s efforts to reconstitute
   a centuries-old empire reminded every nation that had endured colonial
   rule and repression of their own pain.  Then, he exacerbated the
   economic hardship many nations were already experiencing due to COVID
   and climate change by cutting off Ukraine’s grain from the world
   markets, driving up the cost of food and fuel everywhere.

   By contrast, on one global challenge after another, the United States
   and our partners have proven that our focus on Ukraine will not
   distract us from working to improve the lives of people around the
   world and address the cascading costs of Russia’s aggression.

   Our unprecedented emergency food aid has prevented millions of people
   from starving to death. Just last year alone, the United States
   provided $13.5 billion in food assistance.  And the United States is
   currently funding over half of the UN World Food Programme’s budget.
   Russia funds less than one percent.

   We supported a deal negotiated by UN Secretary-General Guterres
   and Türkiye to break Russia’s stranglehold on Ukrainian grain, allowing
   29 million tons of food and counting to get out of Ukraine and to
   people around the world.  That includes 8 million tons of wheat, which
   is the equivalent of roughly 16 billion loaves of bread.

   Together with allies and partners, we’re mobilizing hundreds of
   billions of dollars in financing for high-quality infrastructure in the
   countries where it’s needed most and building it in a way that’s
   transparent, good for the environment; empowers local workers and
   communities.

   We’re strengthening global health security, from training half a
   million health professionals in our own hemisphere, in the Americas, to
   helping the pharmaceutical company Moderna finalize plans with Kenya to
   build its first mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility in Africa.

   Time and again, we are demonstrating who fuels global problems and who
   solves them.

   Finally, President Putin’s core aim – indeed, his obsession – has been
   to erase the very idea of Ukraine – its identity, its people, its
   culture, its agency, its territory.  But here, too, Putin’s actions
   have precipitated the opposite effect.  No one has done more to
   strengthen Ukraine’s national identity than the man who sought to wipe
   it out.  No one has done more to deepen Ukrainians’ unity and
   solidarity.  No one has done more to intensify Ukrainians’
   determination to write their own future on their own terms.

   Ukraine will never be Russia.  Ukraine stands sovereign, independent,
   firmly in control of its own destiny.  In this – Putin’s primary goal –
   he has failed most spectacularly.

   President Putin constantly claims that the United States, Europe, and
   countries that support Ukraine are bent on defeating or destroying
   Russia, on toppling its government, on holding back its people.  That
   is false. We do not seek the overthrow of the Russian Government and we
   never have.  Russia’s future is for Russians to decide.

   We have no quarrel with the Russian people, who had no say in starting
   this tragic war.  We lament that Putin is sending tens of thousands of
   Russians to their deaths in a war he could end now, if he chose – and
   inflicting ruinous impact on Russia’s economy and its
   prospects.  Indeed, it must be asked:  How has Putin’s war improved the
   lives, the livelihoods, or the prospects of ordinary Russian citizens?

   Everything that we and our allies and partners do in response to
   Putin’s invasion has the same purpose: to help Ukraine defend its
   sovereignty, its territorial integrity and independence, and to stand
   up for the international rules and principles that are threatened by
   Putin’s ongoing war.

   Let me say this directly to the Russian people:  The United States is
   not your enemy.  At the peaceful end of the Cold War, we shared the
   hope that Russia would emerge to a brighter future, free and open,
   fully integrated with the world.  For more than 30 years, we worked to
   pursue stable and cooperative relations with Moscow, because we
   believed that a peaceful, secure, and prosperous Russia is in America’s
   interests – indeed, in the interests of the world.  We still believe
   that today.

   We cannot choose your future for you, and we won’t try to do so.  But
   we also will not let President Putin impose his will on other nations.
   Moscow must treat the independence, the sovereignty, the territorial
   integrity of its neighbors with the same respect that it demands for
   Russia.

   Now, as I’ve made clear, by virtually every measure, President Putin’s
   invasion of Ukraine has been a strategic failure.  Yet while Putin has
   failed to achieve his aims, he hasn’t given up on them.  He’s convinced
   that he can simply outlast Ukraine and its supporters, sending more and
   more Russians to their deaths, inflicting more and more suffering on
   Ukraine’s civilians.  He thinks that even if he loses the short game,
   he can still win the long game.  Putin is wrong about this, too.

   The United States – together with our allies and partners – is firmly
   committed to supporting Ukraine’s defense today, tomorrow, for as long
   as it takes.  And in America, this support is bipartisan.  And
   precisely because we have no illusions about Putin’s aspirations, we
   believe the prerequisite for meaningful diplomacy and real peace is a
   stronger Ukraine, capable of deterring and defending against any future
   aggression.

   We’ve rallied a formidable team around this effort.  With Secretary of
   Defense Austin’s leadership, more than 50 countries are cooperating
   through the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.  And we’re leading by the
   power of our example, providing tens of billions of dollars in security
   assistance to Ukraine with robust and unwavering support from both
   sides of the aisle in our Congress.

   Today, America and our allies and partners are helping meet Ukraine’s
   needs on the current battlefield while developing a force that can
   deter and defend against aggression for years to come.  That means
   helping build a Ukrainian military of the future, with long-term
   funding, a strong air force centered on modern combat aircraft, an
   integrated air and missile defense network, advanced tanks and armored
   vehicles, national capacity to produce ammunition, and the training and
   support to keep forces and equipment combat-ready.

   That also means Ukraine’s membership in NATO will be a matter for
   Allies and Ukraine – not Russia – to decide.  The path to peace will be
   forged not only through Ukraine’s long-term military strength, but also
   the strength of its economy and its democracy. This is at the heart of
   our vision for the way forward:  Ukraine must not only survive, it must
   thrive.  To be strong enough to deter and defend against aggressors
   beyond its borders, Ukraine needs a vibrant, prosperous democracy
   within its borders.

   That’s the path the Ukrainian people voted for when they won their
   independence in 1991.  It’s the choice they defended in the Maidan in
   2004, and again in 2013: a free and open society, with respect for
   human rights and the rule of law, fully integrated with Europe, where
   all Ukrainians have dignity and the opportunity to realize their full
   potential – and where the government responds to the needs of its
   people, not those of vested interests and elites.

   We are committed to working with allies and partners to help Ukrainians
   make their vision a reality.  We’ll not only help Ukraine rebuild its
   economy, but reimagine it, with new industries, trade routes, supply
   chains connected with Europe and with markets around the world.  We’ll
   continue to bolster Ukraine’s independent anti-corruption bodies, a
   free and vibrant press, civil society organizations.  We’ll help
   Ukraine overhaul its energy grid – more than half of which has been
   destroyed by Russia – and do it in a way that’s cleaner, more
   resilient, and more integrated with its neighbors, so that Ukraine can
   one day become an energy exporter.

   Ukraine’s greater integration with Europe is vital to all of these
   efforts.  Kyiv took a giant step in that direction last June, when the
   union formally granted Ukraine EU candidate status.  And Kyiv is
   working to make progress toward the EU’s benchmarks even as it fights
   for its survival.

   Investing in Ukraine’s strength is not at the expense of diplomacy.  It
   paves the way for diplomacy.  President Zelenskyy has said repeatedly
   that diplomacy is the only way to end this war, and we agree.  In
   December, he put forward a vision for a just and lasting
   peace.  Instead of engaging on that proposal or even offering one of
   his own, President Putin has said there is nothing to talk about until
   Ukraine accepts, and I quote, “new territorial realities” – in other
   words, accept Russia’s seizure of 20 percent of Ukraine’s
   territory.  Putin spent the winter trying to freeze Ukrainian civilians
   to death, and then the spring trying to bomb them to death.  Day after
   day, Russia rains down missiles and drones on Ukrainian apartment
   buildings, schools, hospitals.

   Now, from a distance, it’s easy to become numb to these and other
   Russian atrocities, like the drone strike last week on a medical clinic
   in Dnipro, which killed four people, including doctors; or the 17
   strikes on Kyiv in the month of May alone, many using hypersonic
   missiles; or the missile attack in April on the city of Uman – hundreds
   of miles from the front lines – in which 23 civilians were killed.  The
   rocket strike hit multiple apartment buildings in Uman before dawn.  In
   one of those buildings, a father, Dmytro, raced to the room where his
   children were sleeping – Kyrylo, age 17; Sophia, age 11.  But when he
   opened the door to their bedroom, there was no room, just fire and
   smoke.  His children were gone.  Two more innocent lives extinguished.
   Two of the six children Russia killed in a single strike.  Two of the
   thousands of Ukrainian children killed by Russia’s war of aggression.
   Thousands more have been wounded, and thousands beyond that have been
   abducted from their families by Russia and given to Russian families.
   Millions have been displaced.  All are part of a generation of
   Ukrainian children terrorized, traumatized, scarred by Putin’s war of
   aggression, all of whom remind us why Ukrainians are so fiercely
   committed to defending their nation and why they deserve – deserve – a
   just and lasting peace.

   Now, some have argued that if the United States truly wanted peace,
   we’d stop supporting Ukraine, and then if Ukraine truly wanted to end
   the war, it would just cut its losses and give up the fifth of its
   territory that Russia illegally occupies.  Let’s play this out for a
   minute.  What neighbors of Russia would feel confident in their own
   sovereignty and territorial integrity if Putin’s aggression were to be
   rewarded with a fifth of Ukraine’s territory?

   And for that matter, how would any country that lives near a bully,
   with a history of threats and aggression, feel secure within its own
   borders?   What lesson will other would-be aggressors around the world
   learn if Putin is allowed to violate a core tenet of the UN Charter
   with impunity?   And how often in history have aggressors who seize all
   or part of a neighboring country been satisfied and stopped there?
   When has that ever satisfied Vladimir Putin?

   The United States has been working with Ukraine – and allies and
   partners around the world – to build consensus around the core elements
   of a just and lasting peace.  To be clear, the United States welcomes
   any initiative that helps bring President Putin to the table to engage
   in meaningful diplomacy.  We’ll support efforts – whether by Brazil, by
   China, or any other nation – if they help find a way to a just and
   lasting peace, consistent with the principles of the United Nations
   Charter.

   Here’s what that means.

   A just and lasting peace must uphold the UN Charter and affirm the
   principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence.

   A just and lasting peace requires Ukraine’s full participation and
   assent – nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.

   A just and lasting peace must support Ukraine’s reconstruction and
   recovery, with Russia paying its share.

   A just and lasting peace must address both accountability and
   reconciliation.

   A just and lasting peace can open a pathway to sanctions relief
   connected to concrete actions, especially military withdrawal.  A just
   and lasting peace must end Russia’s war of aggression.

   Now, over the coming weeks and months, some countries will call for a
   ceasefire.  And on the surface, that sounds sensible – attractive,
   even.  After all, who doesn’t want warring parties to lay down their
   arms?  Who doesn’t want the killing to stop?

   But a ceasefire that simply freezes current lines in place and enables
   Putin to consolidate control over the territory he’s seized, and then
   rest, re-arm, and re-attack – that is not a just and lasting peace.
   It’s a Potemkin peace.  It would legitimize Russia’s land grab.  It
   would reward the aggressor and punish the victim.

   If and when Russia is ready to work for true peace, the United States
   will respond in concert with Ukraine and other allies and partners
   around the world.  And along with Ukraine and allies and partners, we
   would be prepared to have a broader discussion on European security
   that promotes stability and transparency and reduces the likelihood of
   future conflict.

   In the weeks and months ahead, the United States will continue to work
   with Ukraine, with our allies and partners – and any and all parties
   dedicated to supporting a just and lasting peace based on these
   principles.

   On April 4, 1949, 74 years to the day before Finland joined NATO, the
   original members of the Alliance gathered in Washington to sign its
   founding treaty.  President Truman warned the group, and I quote, “We
   cannot succeed if our people are haunted by the constant fear of
   aggression and burdened by the cost of preparing their nations
   individually against attack.  [W]e hope to create a shield against
   aggression and the fear of aggression – a bulwark which will permit us
   to get on with the real business of . . . achieving a fuller and
   happier life for all our citizens.”

   The same is true today.  No nation – not Ukraine, not the United
   States, not Finland, Sweden, any other country can deliver for its
   people if it lives in constant fear of aggression.  That’s why we’ve
   all got a stake in ensuring that President Putin’s war of aggression
   against Ukraine continues to be a strategic failure.

   In his New Year’s address to the Finnish people, President Niinistö
   identified one of the fundamental flaws of President Putin’s plan to
   swiftly conquer Ukraine – a flaw that also doomed Stalin’s plan to
   swiftly conquer Finland.  As President Niinistö said, and I quote, “As
   leaders of a country under authoritarian rule, Stalin and Putin failed
   to recognize . . . that people living in a free country have their own
   will and convictions.  And that a nation that works together
   constitutes an immense force.”

   Finns have a word for that fierce combination of will and
   determination: sisu.  And they recognize sisu in the struggle of
   Ukrainians today.  And when a free people like the Ukrainians have at
   their backs the support of free nations around the world – nations who
   recognize their fates and freedom – their rights and security are
   inextricably bound together, the force they possess is not merely
   immense.  It is unstoppable.

   Thank you very much.  (Applause.)

Russia says it's 'destroying' Ukrainians that crossed into occupied
territory, vowing to inflict 'hell' on them

   Holly Ellyatt

   This was CNBC's live blog tracking developments on the war in Ukraine.

   Fierce fighting has erupted between Russian forces and Ukrainian units
   that crossed over the Dnieper River to the Russian-occupied eastern
   bank of the river in the southern Kherson region.

   Battles are concentrated around a number of villages on the east or
   left bank of the river where Ukraine has managed to establish several
   footholds, but Russian forces are now reported to be pounding those
   positions.

   A Russian-installed official in the occupied part of Kherson said
   Russian forces were "destroying" Ukrainian forces "on the largest
   scale" in the village of Krynky, where he claimed they had been
   trapped.

   front line near Kherson, Ukraine, on Oct. 14, 2023.

   Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War painted a picture of
   mixed fortunes for Ukrainian forces in the area, citing Ukrainian
   officials, Russian military bloggers closely following developments in
   the war and open-source evidence.

   In other news, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that
   any internal and external attempts to interfere with the 2024
   presidential election in Russia will be suppressed.

   Putin said any measures necessary will be taken to prevent any illegal
   obstruction of the election, including any pressure applied to the
   electoral process. Russia has long been accused of interfering in the
   electoral processes of other countries, particularly the U.S. vote in
   2016, although it denies the allegations.

Russian opposition politician sentenced to eight years in prison: State media

   Vladimir Milov, a Russian opposition politician, was sentenced in
   absentia to eight years in a prison for intentionally spreading false
   information about the Russian Armed Forces, Russian state news agency
   Interfax reported Thursday. A video on YouTube was cited as the basis
   for the case.

   Milov previously worked under President Vladimir Putin but became
   disillusioned with the track that Russia's geopolitical approach was on
   and now lives abroad.

   His sentence would begin as soon as he were detained on Russian
   territory or extradited to Russia, Interfax reported.

One dead, four injured by Russian shelling, governor of Kherson Oblast says

   One person has died and four others have been wounded by Russian
   shelling on the town of Bilozerka in Kherson Oblast, the local governor
   Oleksandr Prokudin said Thursday. This comes as fighting has
   accelerated in the Kherson region in southern Ukraine in recent days.

   In a post on Telegram, translated via Google Translate, he said one man
   had been pulled out from under rubble from a house that was affected in
   the attacks. Those injured have been taken to hospital, Produkin said.

   The governor said residential buildings and a grocery store had been
   hit, as well as important infrastructure. Bilozerka and surrounding
   towns were out of electricity, he said.

   CNBC could not independently verify reports on the ground.

   A Russian court on Thursday found artist and musician Alexandra
   Skochilenko guilty of knowingly spreading fake news about the Russian
   army's behavior in Ukraine and sentenced her to seven years in a prison
   colony.

   Skochilenko, 33, replaced price tags in a supermarket in her native St
   Petersburg on March 31 2022 with small pieces of paper urging an end to
   Russia's war in Ukraine and criticising the authorities.

   She denied the formal charge of knowingly spreading false information
   about the army.

Russia's Black Sea fleet forced to retreat, Zelenskyy says

   warship during the Navy Day celebrations in the port city of
   Novorossiysk on July 30, 2023.

   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that Russia's
   naval fleet was forced to retreat from the eastern part of the Black
   Sea.

   "We were able to intercept Russia's initiative in the Black Sea and
   created such security conditions that force the aggressor to flee from
   the eastern part of the water area and try to hide warships," Zelenskyy
   said on Telegram.

   "As one of the main results of our actions, Russia is unable to use the
   Black Sea as a springboard to destabilize other regions of the world."

   CNBC could not confirm the report.

   Ukraine increased its attacks on Russia's prized Black Sea fleet and
   its headquarters and port infrastructure this year, essentially forcing
   much of the fleet to relocate away from its home base of Sevastopol in
   Russian-occupied Crimea. A number of vessels were transferred to ports
   that flank the Kerch Strait in Novorossiysk, on the Russian mainland,
   and Feodosia on the Crimean coast.

Russia says its 'destroying' Ukrainian forces that crossed into occupied
territory

   Russian forces say they are inflicting heavy losses on Ukrainian
   troops that crossed over the Dnieper River to the Russian-occupied
   eastern bank.

   Russia confirmed that Ukrainian units had crossed the Dnieper and
   conceded that its forces had initially been outnumbered. Since then,
   however, it has warned it had brought in additional forces and that it
   would inflict "hell" on Ukrainian units. Various analysis suggests
   Russia is now pummeling units trying to defend positions along the east
   bank, with the village of Krynky being an epicenter of fighting.

   Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed governor of the occupied part of
   the Kherson region, said Russian forces were pounding Ukrainian
   positions on Thursday.

   "In Krynky, our military is now destroying the enemy on the largest
   scale," Saldo said on Telegram Thursday, saying that Russian forces
   were "surprised at how much the Ukrainian command does not value the
   lives of its personnel, sending them to their death in dozens and
   hundreds."
   "Therefore, it is not surprising that the flow of Ukrainian prisoners
   from the left bank of the Dnieper does not dry up," he said.

   Saldo claimed yesterday that Ukrainian forces were blocked in the
   village of Krynky where "a fiery hell" awaited them. "Bombs, missiles,
   ammunition from heavy flamethrower systems, artillery shells, and
   drones are flying at him [Ukrainian forces] ... Over the last two or
   three days alone, the enemy's total losses amounted to about a hundred
   militants," Saldo said.

   CNBC was unable to verify developments on the battlefield.

Putin met business leaders to try to attract investment back to Russia,
Kremlin says

   Russian President Vladimir Putin met with the country's business
   leaders Wednesday in a bid to encourage them to invest more in Russia,
   Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday.

   "The discussion was about possible steps to improve the investment
   attractiveness of our economy, to create more than competitive
   conditions for completing the process of transferring companies here,"
   Peskov said, according to comments published by Russian news agency RIA
   Novosti.

   Novo-Ogaryovo State Residence, on Nov. 15, 2023, in Moscow, Russia.

   Peskov said Putin discussed completing the process of redomiciling
   businesses, claiming that "the vast majority of entrepreneurs who took
   part have in one way or another encountered illegal treatment abroad,
   and now the process of transferring their business to Russian
   jurisdiction is actively under way, using all available mechanisms."

   Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent imposition of
   international sanctions made it difficult for Western businesses to
   continue operations in Russia, and vice versa. Putin has looked to
   encourage more domestic investment, and has approved the seizing of
   Russian subsidiaries of international companies, including Danone and
   Carlsberg.

Russia likely attempting pincer movement to encircle Avdiivka, UK says

   Russia is almost certainly attempting a pincer movement to encircle the
   town of Avdiivka, a fighting hot spot in the eastern Ukrainian region
   of Donetsk, Britain's Ministry of Defense said Thursday.

   "Over the last week, Russian forces have continued attacks towards
   outlying villages of the contested town of Avdiivka," the ministry said
   on X, formerly known as Twitter.

   Avdiivka is a small town but holds strategic importance for both sides.
   It has been fought over for nearly a decade, given fighting between
   pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces since 2014, and holds
   political significance for Russia given its proximity to the city of
   Donetsk.

   "Recent advances have likely brought Russian forces close to the
   Ukrainian-held Avdiivka Coke and Chemical Plant, a sprawling industrial
   complex which produces coke and a variety of chemicals, occupies a key
   tactical position to the north of the town," the U.K. noted.

   plant is seen in the background on Oct. 30, 2023.

   "The plant dominates the main road into Avdiivka and, if Russian forces
   were to secure it, resupplying the town would become increasingly
   difficult for Ukraine."

   However, the ministry noted, the industrial facility provides Ukraine
   with a localized defensive advantage and Russian forces will probably
   suffer significant personnel losses if they attempt to assault the
   facility.

UK's new foreign minister visits Kyiv

   The U.K.'s new Foreign Secretary David Cameron is in Kyiv Wednesday,
   marking his first visit to Ukraine since taking up the role on Monday.

   Announcing the visit, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the
   pair "had a good meeting focused on weapons for the frontline,
   strengthening air defense, and protecting our people and critical
   infrastructure."

   The U.K. is one of Ukraine's staunchest Western allies and one of its
   largest individual benefactors after the U.S.

   "As Foreign Secretary, supporting Ukraine against Putin's aggression is
   vital, which is why I am pleased to make this my first visit as
   Secretary of State," Cameron said in a statement released by the
   British government.

   "Russia thinks it can wait this war out, and that the West will
   eventually turn its attention elsewhere. This could not be further from
   the truth. In my first discussions with President Zelenskyy in my new
   role, I made clear that the U.K. and our partners will support Ukraine
   and its people for as long as it takes for them to achieve victory."

Fierce fighting erupts after Ukrainian units cross Dnieper river into
occupied territory

   front line near Kherson, Ukraine, on Oct. 14, 2023.

   Fierce fighting is taking place between Russian forces and Ukrainian
   units that crossed over the Dnieper River to the Russian-occupied left
   (or eastern) bank of the river in the southern Kherson region, analysts
   say.

   Fighting is concentrated around a number of villages on the east bank,
   including Krynky, where Ukraine has managed to establish footholds, but
   Russian forces are now reported to be pounding those positions. A
   Russian official warned Wednesday that "hell fire" would be rained down
   upon Ukrainian forces who had crossed the river.

   Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War painted a picture of
   mixed fortunes in the area, citing Ukrainian officials, Russian
   military bloggers closely following developments in the war and
   open-source evidence.

   "Ukrainian forces continued larger-than-usual operations on the east
   (left) bank of Kherson Oblast [region] on November 15," the ISW noted
   in analysis Wednesday.

   But it added that "Russian milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces
   conducted unsuccessful attacks from central Krynky ... [they] also
   claimed that Russian forces prevented Ukrainian forces from conducting
   casualty evacuation and deploying additional Ukrainian personnel to the
   east bank near the Antonivsky road bridge."

   The ISW also noted that geolocated footage published on Nov. 14 shows
   that Russian forces made some advances into Ukrainian-held Krynky, with
   Russian milbloggers claiming that the counterattacks by Russian forces
   forced Ukrainian forces to withdraw from some areas south of Krynky.

   CNBC was unable to verify developments on the ground and neither Russia
   nor Ukraine mentioned the battles taking place in the area in their
   military updates on Thursday. On Wednesday, Ukraine requested an
   "informational silence" around its maneuvers so that its "plans are put
   in motion."

   A senior Ukrainian official said Monday that Ukrainian forces managed
   to cross the Dnieper river which has essentially divided Russian and
   Ukrainian forces since a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive a year
   ago. Russia confirmed the development Wednesday.

   If Ukrainian forces can make progress on the eastern bank, it could
   herald the start of an advance southward to Russian-occupied Crimea.

Russia's Putin says any interference attempts in Russian election will be
suppressed

   Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks after signing bilateral
   documents with his Kazakh counterpart Kassym-Jomart Tokayev in Astana,
   Kazakhstan November 9, 2023.

   Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that any internal
   and external attempts to interfere with the 2024 presidential election
   in Russia will be suppressed, state media outlet TASS reported.

   Putin said any measures necessary would be taken to prevent illegal
   obstruction of the election, including any pressure applied to the
   electoral process, according to a Google translation of his comments.

   Putin has not confirmed if he will run for re-election next year,
   however various news reports have cited sources saying he plans to
   stand for election once again. If he were to be re-elected, his
   presidency could extend until 2030.

   Russia has long been accused of interfering in the electoral processes
   of other countries, particularly the U.S. vote in 2016.

   Last month, the U.S. released an intelligence assessment sent to more
   than 100 countries that found Moscow is using spies, social media and
   Russian state-run media to erode public faith in the integrity of
   democratic elections worldwide, Reuters reported. Russia has repeatedly
   rejected various accusations of interference.

West the biggest obstacle to peace in Ukraine, global survey finds

   The outcome of the war in Ukraine is considered a "determining, and
   even existential," factor in the future of the West, according to a
   survey of 21 countries published Wednesday by the European Council on
   Foreign Relations (ECFR) thinktank and Oxford University.

   The majority of respondents outside of Europe and the U.S. said they
   saw Western nations as a bigger obstacle to peace than Russia, and more
   still viewed Moscow as the ultimate victor in the conflict.

   Almost three quarters of non-European respondents who expected Russia
   to win the war also believed the European Union could "fall apart"
   within the next 20 years, while around one third of those in the U.S.
   and in Europe shared the view.

   For many, the conflict in Ukraine was considered a "proxy war" between
   the U.S. and Russia, with majorities in Russia, China, Saudi Arabia,
   and Turkey saying they believe two Cold War powers are "already at
   war."

Russia pours cold water on forthcoming Xi-Biden talks

   the Konstantin Palace on July 29, 2023 in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

   There was more than a hint of schadenfreude in Russian state coverage
   of the forthcoming meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his
   U.S. counterpart Joe Biden in San Francisco on Wednesday, with Russia
   accentuating the geopolitical gulf between the two superpowers.

   Russia will be watching the talks closely, given its alliance with
   China, and any signs of a rapprochement between Beijing and Washington
   is likely to earn a frosty response from Moscow.

   Russian media reveled in pouring cold water on the Asia-Pacific
   Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit where Xi and Biden are due to meet
   Wednesday.

   A reporter for Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency on Tuesday
   reported that a plenary meeting of the APEC summit chaired by U.S.
   Trade Representative Katherine Tai took place "in a half-empty hall."

   RIA Novosti contrasted its image of a half-empty conference hall with
   the U.S. Trade Representative Tai emphasizing to delegates "how
   important this event is for the United States."

Ukraine asks for 'informational silence' amid 'fluid' fighting on Dnieper
front line

   Ukraine requested an "informational silence," amid fierce fighting on
   the Russian-occupied left (or eastern) bank of the Dnieper River in the
   southern Kherson region.

   "The Russians understand that the advance of the defense forces is
   inevitable, but they cannot calculate from which direction they can
   expect such a danger," Natalia Humeniuk, press officer for Operational
   Command South, said Wednesday in televised comments translated by NBC
   News.

   Russian forces were, she said, "trying to actively defend themselves,
   to actively use heavy artillery, rocket launchers, and aviation as much
   as possible."

   "The pushback from our side is taking place on a line from 3 to 8km [up
   to 5 miles] along the entire coast from the water's edge [of the
   Dnieper River]. The front line is quite fluid today," she said.

   "I cannot reveal all the measures we are currently taking, but it is
   obvious that the enemy is being pressed [by our measures]. For now, we
   are asking for informational silence so that our plans are put in
   motion, it will allow us to report on great successes later."

   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's chief of staff Andriy Yermak
   said Monday that Ukraine's forces had gained a foothold on the left
   side of the river and were looking to advance.

   "Against all odds, Ukraine's defense forces have gained an foothold on
   the left bank of the Dnieper. Step-by-step, we demilitarized Crimea. We
   have covered 70% of the distance," he told the Hudson Institute.

   Russia confirmed the development Wednesday, but said it was pummeling a
   "small group" of Ukrainian troops near the village of Krynky.

   Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed governor of the occupied part of
   Kherson, claimed Ukrainian units were now trapped and were being hit
   with "bombs, rockets, ammunition from heavy flamethrower systems,
   artillery shells [and] drones."

   CNBC could not independently verify the reports.

Russia pummels Ukrainian forces that have crossed over the Dnieper River into
occupied territory

   Russian forces are pummeling Ukrainian units that have crossed over the
   Dnieper River to the Russian-occupied left (or eastern) bank of the
   river in Kherson, a Russian-installed official said Wednesday.

   The Kherson area, in southern Ukraine, is partially occupied by Russian
   forces after an offensive to take the city of Kherson last year
   prompted Russian forces to withdraw to the eastern bank of the river.

   Ukraine reported Tuesday that its forces had established a foothold on
   the eastern bank of the river. The announcement could herald the start
   of an advance toward Russian-occupied Crimea, with Ukraine saying on
   Wednesday that it was starting to push back Russian forces.

   "Along the front line, which runs along the Dnipro [the Dnieper
   River]... The pushback from our side is taking place on a line from 3
   to 8 km (2-5 miles) along the entire bank from the water's edge,"
   Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for the southern military command, said,
   in comments reported by Reuters.

   "For now, we will ask for informational silence ... which would allow
   us to report later on great successes," she added.

   invasion of Ukraine.

   A Russian-installed official, Vladimir Saldo, said in Google-translated
   comments on Telegram that Ukrainian units had been able to cross the
   river — confirming for the first time that this had taken place — and
   said that initially Ukraine had sent "more manpower than our means of
   destruction were able to destroy."

   "Additional forces have now been brought up," he said, claiming that
   Ukrainian forces were blocked in the village of Krynki where "a fiery
   hell" awaited them. "Bombs, missiles, ammunition from heavy
   flamethrower systems, artillery shells, and drones are flying at him
   [Ukrainian forces] ... Over the last two or three days alone, the
   enemy's total losses amounted to about a hundred militants."

   Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War noted Tuesday that
   "Ukrainian forces are continuing their own offensive operations and
   making tactical-level gains along the front, particularly in western
   Zaporizhia Oblast [region] and on the east (left) bank of Kherson
   Oblast," the ISW noted.

   "The Russian military command will likely have to decide whether to
   keep certain Russian elements on certain sectors of the front to defend
   against ongoing Ukrainian offensive operations or to redeploy them to
   support offensive operations elsewhere that will likely culminate
   without reinforcements."

   These choices will likely hinder Russia's ability to fully regain the
   initiative in the coming weeks, the ISW said.

   CNBC was unable to verify developments on the ground.

Commission of Inquiry finds further evidence of war crimes in Ukraine

   20 October 2023 Human Rights

   A new UN report has found continued evidence of war crimes and human
   rights violations committed by Russian authorities in Ukraine,
   including torture, rape and the deportation of children.

   The report by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on
   Ukraine, published on Friday, follows a study issued in March.
   Tweet URL

   UN_HRC

   It documents additional indiscriminate attacks with explosive weapons,
   resulting in deaths, injuries and the destruction and damage of
   civilian objects.

   For example, 24 people, mostly women and children, were killed in an
   attack on a multistorey block of residential apartments in Uman, a city
   in the Cherkasy region, in April, and part of the building became
   uninhabitable.  Commissioners spoke with residents during their recent
   visit to the country.

New evidence, same torture pattern

   Their investigations also confirmed previous findings that Russian
   authorities used torture in a widespread and systematic way in various
   types of detention facilities.

   New evidence collected in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions found
   Russian authorities used the same pattern of torture in areas under
   their control, mainly against men suspected of passing information to
   the Ukrainian authorities or supporting the Ukrainian armed forces.

   The commissioners said their interviews with victims and witnesses
   revealed “a profound disregard towards human dignity by Russian
   authorities”. Witnesses reported situations in which torture had been
   committed so brutally that the victim died.

Lasting traumatic impacts

   Recent investigations in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions showed
   that rape and other sexual violence were often committed together with
   additional acts of violence, including severe beatings, strangling,
   suffocating, slashing, shooting next to the head of the victim, and
   wilful killing.

   In one instance, a 75-year-old woman who stayed alone to protect her
   property, was raped and tortured by a Russian soldier who hit her on
   the face, chest, and ribs, and strangled her, while interrogating her.

   The soldier ordered the woman to undress and when she refused, he
   ripped off her clothes, cut her abdomen with a small sharp object and
   raped her several times. The woman also suffered several broken ribs
   and teeth.

   Such traumatic experiences have severe and long-term consequences for
   the physical and mental health of the victims, the report said.

Unlawful child deportations

   The Commissioners investigated further accounts of Ukrainian children
   being transferred to Russia or to Russian-occupied areas in Ukraine.
   They concluded that the transfer of 31 children to Russia in May 2022
   was an unlawful deportation, thus a war crime.

   Their report also contains three cases where investigations showed that
   Ukrainian authorities committed violations of human rights against
   persons accused of collaboration with Russia.

   They underlined the importance of accountability “with full respect and
   care for the rights of the victims.”

   The UN Human Rights Council established the Independent Commission of
   Inquiry on Ukraine in March 2022, shortly after the start of the
   full-scale Russian invasion. The mandate was extended in April for an
   additional year.

   The three Commissioners are not UN staff and do not receive payment for
   their work.

Ukraine: Russia’s losses mount – but self-sacrifice in war is part of the

   A recent intelligence report published by the UK’s Ministry of Defence
   about Russia’s attempt to capture the town of Avdiivka in the Donetsk
   region is the latest illustration of just how much the conflict in
   Ukraine is becoming a war of attrition. Russia’s push to mount a new
   offensive in the east has resulted in substantive “personnel losses”
   for its military.

   In the west, many assume that every inch of Ukrainian land that is
   liberated brings Russia closer to military defeat and Europe to peace.
   But Russia has adapted to both internal and external shocks. As of
   August, it was estimated that Russia had suffered “as many as 120,000
   deaths”. That number will have risen in recent weeks. And as the death
   toll climbs, the ability to replace troops becomes as important as
   military equipment and technology.

   Even though many young men left Russia rather than be sent to the
   front, the country still has a large pool of young men from which to
   recruit and has claimed to have enlisted a large number without
   resorting to general conscription – although the Kremlin’s figures have
   been questioned by other sources.

   But the question remains as to how many Russian military deaths is too
   many for Putin to retain the support of the Russian people. And it’s a
   very difficult question to answer. In Russia, the notion of military
   sacrifice plays an important role in informing national identity.

   (BUTTON)

   Russia’s national story is constituted by loss. It has lived and
   continues to live a tale of self-induced suffering. Even just
   considering the past century, military losses during the second world
   war and in Afghanistan – followed by the loss of a sense of identity
   after the collapse of the Soviet empire in 1991 – have all come to
   define Russia’s character today. The sense of the “loss of empire” is
   what has driven Vladimir Putin’s foreign adventurism in Georgia and
   Ukraine.

For the motherland

   For the British people, the death of 179 solidiers in Iraq was
   traumatic enough for leaders to change course. But military sacrifice
   has a different meaning in Russia, one that is diametrically opposed to
   the value the liberal west places on the individual subject.

   For Russia, every dead soldier in Ukraine constitutes a step towards
   victory and reclaiming the great power image of the country’s Soviet
   past. While the west’s liberal philosophy promulgates the importance of
   individual rights, Russia is defined by a system of collectivism.
   Within its value system, the individual subject confers prestige
   through their self-sacrifice for the collective wellbeing.

   In Soviet iconography, tropes of self-sacrifice and fatal injury tend
   to be closely tied to nationalist ideas of pride and superiority. They
   pervaded propaganda posters during the “great patriotic war”.
   Image of 'For the Motherland' 1942 Russian propaganda poster by Aleksei
   Kokorekin
   Russia’s notion of sacrifice: ‘For the Motherland’ (1942).

   Take the image For the Motherland! (1942) by Aleksei Kokorekin as an
   example. It conveyed Soviet resilience through the portrayal of a
   wounded soldier fighting on bravely and showing no sign of physical
   weakness despite his injuries.

   This juxtaposition between the injured self and national status is
   telling. Kokorekin’s depiction of Soviet heroism was also indicative of
   the Soviet mentality on death – where the emphasis on physical
   suffering became a source of national superiority.

Spirituality of loss

   This logic permeated the consciousness of subsequent generations and in
   how they interpreted military sacrifice. For her 1990 study Tsinkovye
   mal’chiki (translated as Zinky Boys) by Nobel prize-winning writer
   Svetlana Aleksievich, the author interviewed army veterans from the
   campaign in Afghanistan. She recalled how in one interview an artillery
   soldier described war as “a spiritual experience”, while referencing
   the self-sacrifice of the Red Army during the great patriotic war.

   This experience of spirituality through war not only reflects how
   Russians seek to replay and become part of the past, but speaks to the
   religious dimension of Russia’s discourse on self-sacrifice. This theme
   emerged strongly in comments by Patriarch Kirill, the head of the
   Russian Orthodox Church, in September 2022, in which he was encouraging
   Russian men to join up.

     …if a person dies in the performance of this duty [war], then they
     have undoubtedly committed an act equivalent to sacrifice. They will
     have sacrificed themselves for others. And therefore, we believe
     that this sacrifice washes away all the sins that a person has
     committed.

   His statement rationalised the self-sacrifice of the Russian soldier on
   the basis that it served a transcendental duty – a Christ-like
   sacrifice – which would ultimately absolve them from sin. The
   patriarch’s comments speak to a particular historical tradition of
   religious masochism – the practice of self-induced physical trauma – in
   Russia, which dates back to “the early days of Christian Rus’”.

Military martyrdom

   Deciphering this internal logic governing the way many Russians deal
   with loss is imperative to the west’s understanding of the Ukraine war.
   Putin draws on a language of sacrifice which has its cultural and
   historical roots in Russian Orthodox thinking and Soviet mythology.

   This language reveals something important about Russian psychology when
   it comes to dealing with news of large-scale casualties on the
   battlefield. A soldier’s body is a potent mixture of the political and
   spiritual in the Russian psyche.

   The death of that body is for Russia a step towards achieving the
   fantasy of national prestige. For some Russians (by no means all), the
   trauma of military loss does not mean that they should stop fighting in
   Ukraine. On the contrary, it can represent a pathway to martyrdom.

   increasing use of kamikaze drones
     * See all our Ukraine coverage

     * Ukrainian forces have secured a foothold on the east bank of the
       Dnipro River in southern Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of
       staff was quoted as saying. Andriy Yermak’s remarks were the first
       official acknowledgment that Ukrainian troops were established on
       the Dnipro’s east bank in Kherson region, Reuters reported.
     * A top Ukrainian military official has said Russian troops have
       continued simultaneous assault attempts in several directions on
       the country’s east, and are increasing the use of kamikaze drones,
       Reuters reported. The head of Ukraine’s ground forces, Gen
       Oleksandr Syrskyi, said that Russia, despite high losses, has been
       attacking Ukrainian positions near Kupiansk. “In addition, the
       enemy has increased the use of kamikaze drones,” he said on
       Telegram.
     * Serhiy Lysak, the governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, said
       Russia had hit Nikopol region 11 times on Tuesday, using kamikaze
       drones and artillery. He wrote on Telegram that the district centre
       was most heavily targeted and that a 26-year-old man died.
     * The former detective Sergei Khadzhikurbanov, convicted for his role
       in the 2006 killing of investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya,
       has been pardoned after fighting in Ukraine, his lawyer said. “As a
       special forces fighter, he was invited to sign a contract to
       participate in the special military operation … When the contract
       expired, he was pardoned by presidential decree,” lawyer Alexei
       Mikhalchik told AFP.
     * Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said Russia is
       increasing its attacks across the frontline, AFP reported. “The
       military reported an increase in the number of enemy assaults,”
       Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram on Tuesday, saying Russian forces were
       attacking around Donetsk, Kupiansk and Avdiivka.
     * The former detective Sergei Khadzhikurbanov, convicted for his role
       in the 2006 killing of investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya,
       has been pardoned after fighting in Ukraine, his lawyer said. “As a
       special forces fighter, he was invited to sign a contract to
       participate in the special military operation … When the contract
       expired, he was pardoned by presidential decree,” lawyer Alexei
       Mikhalchik told AFP.
     * Vladimir Putin has approved changes to the law that governs
       presidential elections by putting new restrictions on media
       coverage, local news agencies reported.
     * The EU will miss its target of supplying Ukraine with 1m artillery
       shells and missiles by next March, the German defence minister
       said. Boris Pistorius’s comments, the first public admission by a
       senior European minister that the target would not be met, were
       made before a summit of EU defence ministers in Brussels on
       Wednesday.
     * Russian shelling on Monday damaged a hospital and homes in the
       southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, killing three people and
       injuring at least 12, local governor Oleksandr Prokudin said.
     * Xi Jinping and Joe Biden are expected to discuss Ukraine, the
       Middle East, North Korea’s ties with Russia, Taiwan, human rights,
       artificial intelligence, in a meeting scheduled for Wednesday at
       the Apec summit.
     * At least three Russian officers were killed in the
       Moscow-controlled Ukrainian city of Melitopol in a blast Ukraine’s
       intelligence said was an “act of revenge” by local resistance
       groups.
     * US secretary of state Antony Blinken and newly appointed British
       foreign secretary David Cameron discussed the Israel-Hamas
       conflict, relations with China and help for Ukraine during a
       telephone call on Monday, the state department said. “Secretary
       Blinken and Lord Cameron underscored continuity in the US-UK
       special relationship and its importance to regional and global
       security,” state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a
       readout of the conversation.
     * Blinken promised a top Ukrainian official that sustained US support
       including help to get through the winter, with Russia expected to
       strike Kyiv’s infrastructure again. Blinken met Andriy Yermak, a
       top aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on a brief stop in
       Washington in between the top US diplomat’s latest Middle East
       crisis tour and an Asia-Pacific summit in San Francisco.
     * Save Ukraine, an organisation that focuses on rescuing Ukraine’s
       most vulnerable people, has said its rescuers have evacuated more
       than 108,880 people from the frontlines since Russia launched its
       full-scale invasion in February 2022. It said its rescue network
       provided humanitarian assistance to more than 186,450 people, with
       its hotline operators fielding more than 161,425 calls from
       Ukrainians in urgent need of assistance.

Ukraine has claimed initiative in Black Sea and forced Russian navy to pull
back, Zelenskiy says

   The president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Thursday that Ukraine had
   seized the initiative from Russia in the Black Sea and forced Russia’s
   naval fleet to pull back in the eastern part of the sea.

   “For the first time in the world, it was in the Black Sea that a fleet
   of naval drones began to operate – a Ukrainian fleet,” Zelenskiy wrote
   on the Telegram.

   “I would also like to note that now – as one of the main results of our
   actions – Russia is unable to use the Black Sea as a springboard to
   destabilise other regions of the world.”

Closing summary

   The Ukraine live blog is coming to a close. Below is a summary of the
   day’s events:
     * Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Ukraine had seized the initiative
       from Russia in the Black Sea and forced Russia’s naval fleet to
       pull back in the eastern part of the sea.
     * The foreign secretary, David Cameron, met the Ukrainian president,
       Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during a trip to Kyiv, pledging continued
       military support and a refocus on Ukraine as conflict continues in
       the Middle East.
     * At least one person was killed and two injured during Russian
       shelling of the southern Ukrainian Kherson region, the local
       governor Oleksandr Prokudin said.
     * The Ukrainian military shot down 16 out of 18 attack drones
       launched by Russia as well as one missile during overnight strikes,
       Kyiv’s air force said.
     * Rescuers cleared rubble from a Russian strike on a residential
       building in the eastern Ukrainian town of Selydove the previous
       day, and one more body was recovered, taking the death toll to
       three, an emergency service said.
     * Russian forces have continued attacks in the contested town of
       Avdiivka in Donetsk oblast, according to the UK’s Ministry of
       Defence. In the latest intelligence update, the MoD said: “Russia
       is almost certainly attempting a pincer movement to encircle the
       town.”
     * The European Commission has proposed a 12th round of sanctions
       against Moscow, including restrictions on scores of individuals
       apparently including the son of former president Dmitry Medvedev
       and a relative of Vladimir Putin’s.
     * Finland will close four of the nine crossing points on its border
       with Russia to stem a flow of asylum seekers to the Nordic nation,
       the prime minister, Petteri Orpo, said on Thursday.
     * The Kremlin has said that the Czech Republic’s decision to freeze
       Russian state-owned properties was illegal and that Moscow may
       retaliate against what it called a hostile step.
     * The Russian financial watchdog Rosfinmonitoring has placed three
       lawyers for the jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny on a
       list of “terrorists and extremists”.
     * A Russian court has found the artist and musician Alexandra
       Skochilenko guilty of knowingly spreading fake news about the
       Russian army’s behaviour in Ukraine and sentenced her to seven
       years in a prison colony. Amnesty International has declared
       33-year-old Skochilenko – who replaced supermarket price tags with
       messages calling for an end to Moscow’s war in Ukraine – “a
       prisoner of conscience”.

Russia has sustained casualties of 300,000-400,000, western officials say

   Dan Sabbagh

   Russia has sustained casualties of between 300,000 and 400,000 killed
   and wounded in the war in Ukraine so far, and in the heaviest fighting
   at Avdiivka is losing between 500 and 1,000 a day according to a
   briefing by western officials.

   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, nevertheless
   acknowledged that Ukraine's counter offensive on the Zaporizhzhia front
   has essentially culminated, although "three brigades" are believed to
   have made it across the Dnipro river near Kherson.

   "Neither side is capable of mounting a decisive operation on land," one
   of the officials said, and it appeared that "a prolonged conflict" was
   likely to follow in which long term US and European military aid would
   be crucial.

   A significant force, described as three brigades, had established a
   position across the Dnipro that the Russians have proved unable to
   dislodge, although it was unclear, they said, how much armour the
   Ukrainian military had been able to get across the river.

   But despite the cross-river success, the officials said they expected
   that Ukraine would most likely only be able to make incremental
   "village at a time" progress, a similar pace to summer efforts south of
   Orikhiv and Velyka Novosilka.

   The UK defence secretary, Grant Shapps, has said the government will
   back British defence companies that “help nations like Ukraine” against

     * The foreign secretary, David Cameron, met the Ukrainian president,
       Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during a trip to Kyiv, pledging continued
       military support and a refocus on Ukraine as conflict continues in
       the Middle East.
     * At least one person was killed and two injured during Russian
       shelling of the southern Ukrainian Kherson region, the local
       governor Oleksandr Prokudin said.
     * The Ukrainian military shot down 16 out of 18 attack drones
       launched by Russia as well as one missile during overnight strikes,
       Kyiv’s air force said.
     * Rescuers cleared rubble from a Russian strike on a residential
       building in the eastern Ukrainian town of Selydove the previous
       day, and one more body was recovered, taking the death toll to
       three, an emergency service said.
     * Russian forces have continued attacks in the contested town of
       Avdiivka in Donetsk oblast, according to the UK’s Ministry of
       Defence. In the latest intelligence update, the MoD said: “Russia
       is almost certainly attempting a pincer movement to encircle the
       town.”
     * The European Commission has proposed a 12th round of sanctions
       against Moscow, including restrictions on scores of individuals
       apparently including the son of former president Dmitry Medvedev
       and a relative of Vladimir Putin’s.
     * Finland will close four of the nine crossing points on its border
       with Russia to stem a flow of asylum seekers to the Nordic nation,
       the prime minister, Petteri Orpo, said on Thursday.
     * The Kremlin has said that the Czech Republic’s decision to freeze
       Russian state-owned properties was illegal and that Moscow may
       retaliate against what it called a hostile step.
     * The Russian financial watchdog Rosfinmonitoring has placed three
       lawyers for the jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny on a
       list of “terrorists and extremists”.
     * Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Ukraine had seized the initiative
       from Russia in the Black Sea and forced Russia’s naval fleet to
       pull back in the eastern part of the sea.
     * A Russian court has found the artist and musician Alexandra
       Skochilenko guilty of knowingly spreading fake news about the
       Russian army’s behaviour in Ukraine and sentenced her to seven
       years in a prison colony. Amnesty International has declared
       33-year-old Skochilenko – who replaced supermarket price tags with
       messages calling for an end to Moscow’s war in Ukraine – “a
       prisoner of conscience”.

   Russia’s state nuclear power corporation has reported that turbine
   blades broke at a plant where the company has installed two reactors of
   a type it is also building in Turkey and plans to construct in Hungary.

   Rosenergoatom, which runs Russia’s nuclear power stations, said it was
   not clear what caused the blades to break, forcing the shutdown of a
   unit at the Leningrad nuclear power plant west of St Petersburg on
   Sunday.

   “The main thing now is to understand the reason for the destruction of
   the blades. This is a new phenomenon,” said Alexander Shutikov, the
   head of Rosenergoatom. He said repairs should be completed by 22
   December.

   The unit where the problem occurred was built in 2018 with a
   next-generation VVER 1200, a pressurised water reactor. Units of this
   type are being built by Russia at the Akkuyu nuclear power plant in
   Turkey and are planned for the Paks-2 plant in Hungary. Russia has
   already supplied them to Belarus.

   Shutikov said the blades that failed were part of a 1,200MW high-speed
   steam turbine. The turbines are produced by the businessman Alexei
   Mordashov’s Power Machines company.

   Power Machines said turbines of the same type had operated without
   problems since 2016 at four power units. It said it was taking all
   steps to restart the affected unit as soon as possible and working with
   specialists from the plant to investigate the causes and identify
   defects.

   “Based on the results, conclusions will be drawn and compensatory
   measures will be determined,” it said in reply to a request for comment
   from Reuters.

   Rosatom, the parent of Rosenergoatom, said similar turbine models are
   in operation at another unit of the Leningrad plant and in the southern
   Voronezh region. The company said it always investigates and corrects
   any malfunction.

   “Since turbines are not part of the ‘nuclear island’ of the plant,
   their malfunctioning has no impact on nuclear safety, as all reactor
   equipment is functioning as intended,” it said.

   At least one person was killed and two injured during Russian shelling
   of the southern Ukrainian Kherson region, the local governor Oleksandr
   Prokudin said on Thursday.

   “The enemy fire damaged residential buildings and a grocery store. A
   critical infrastructure facility was also destroyed,” Prokudin said on
   the Telegram messaging app, Reuters reports.

   Russian troops abandoned Kherson and the western bank of the Dnipro
   River in the region late last year, but now regularly shell those areas
   from positions on the eastern bank.

   The Guardian could not independently confirm the report.

   David Cameron has travelled to Kyiv for his first trip as UK foreign
   secretary in an unannounced visit just days after his surprise
   appointment.

   As he met Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Cameron pledged
   that long-term British support for Ukraine would continue. The meeting
   came amid concern in Ukraine around global support, with the conflict
   in the Middle East taking attention away from the country, and
   longer-term questions about western financial support as the US heads
   into an election cycle

   Russian authorities on Wednesday detained two senior employees from
   Carlsberg’s Russian subsidiary, Baltika Breweries, over allegations of
   fraud, and made similar claims against several others, the Danish
   brewer Carlsberg said on Thursday.

   The company said in a statement the allegations were “fake”.

   Moscow in July took control of Carlsberg’s stake in Baltika through a
   presidential decree, saying it would put the foreign-owned stake under
   “temporary management”.

   CEO Jacob Aarup-Andersen last month said Russia had “stolen” its
   business, adding the group had cut all ties with its Russian business
   and refused to enter a deal with Russia’s government that would make
   its seizure of the assets look legitimate.

   “It is appalling that the efforts of the Russian state to justify their
   illegal takeover of our business in Russia has now evolved into
   targeting innocent employees,” Carlsberg said in a statement.

   The Vyborgsky district court on Wednesday ruled that Denis
   Sherstennikov and Anton Rogachevsky be remanded in custody on charges
   of large-scale fraud, accusing them and other unidentified people of
   having used their position at Baltika to transfer some intellectual
   property rights to Carlsberg as the Russian state assumed control of
   the brewer.

   The two men could not immediately be reached for comment. According to
   their Linkedin profiles, Sherstennikov is CEO of Baltika Breweries and
   Rogachevsky is vice-president, legal.

   “The allegations reported in Russian media are fake,” Carlsberg said.
   Large-scale fraud can carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.

   Police in St Petersburg and Baltika did not immediately respond to
   requests for comment.

   Baltika is suing Carlsberg in Russia, seeking to retain the right to
   use the Danish brewer’s trademarks. On Wednesday, a St Petersburg court
   granted Baltika’s request to hold proceedings behind closed doors,
   citing the need to protect trade secrets, Russian news agencies
   reported.

   Carlsberg has informed Baltika that the licence agreements enabling it
   to produce, market and sell all Carlsberg Group products, including
   international and regional brands, have been terminated.

   Executives have told Reuters that repercussions for local staff were
   among the top concerns for companies trying to negotiate an exit from
   Russia.

Ukraine has claimed initiative in Black Sea and forced Russian navy to pull
back, Zelenskiy says

   The president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Thursday that Ukraine had
   seized the initiative from Russia in the Black Sea and forced Russia’s
   naval fleet to pull back in the eastern part of the sea.

   “For the first time in the world, it was in the Black Sea that a fleet
   of naval drones began to operate – a Ukrainian fleet,” Zelenskiy wrote
   on the Telegram.

   “I would also like to note that now – as one of the main results of our
   actions – Russia is unable to use the Black Sea as a springboard to
   destabilise other regions of the world.”

   lawyers for the jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny on a list
   of “terrorists and extremists”, Reuters reports.

   The three lawyers, Vadim Kobzev, Igor Sergunin and Alexei Liptser, were
   placed in custody on 13 October. They are being investigated on
   suspicion of belonging to an “extremist group”.

   minister, Petteri Orpo, said on Thursday.

   “The government has today decided that Finland will close some eastern
   border crossing points. The eastern border for that part will close on
   the night between Friday and Saturday,” Orpo told a press conference.

EU plans fresh Russia sanctions including against son of Dmitry Medvedev

   The European Commission is proposing a 12th round of sanctions against
   Moscow, including restrictions on scores of individuals apparently
   including the son of the former president Dmitry Medvedev and a
   relative of Vladimir Putin’s.

   president Dmitry Medvedev. His son is among scores to be added to lists

   Among the 47 individuals the commission wants added to existing
   sanctions lists are Putin’s cousin Anna Tsivileva, who chairs the
   “defenders of the fatherland” foundation which supports Russian
   soldiers fighting in Ukraine.

   Also on the extended list is Ilya Medvedev, whose name and date of
   birth match those of the former president’s only son. He is targeted
   for allegedly orchestrating a disinformation and propaganda campaign in
   Ukraine.

   The inclusion of the relatives of senior officials, including the Putin
   family, will provoke anger in the Kremlin.

Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 599

   As the war enters its 599th day, these are the main developments.

   Published On 15 Oct 202315 Oct 2023

   Here is the situation on Sunday, October 15, 2023.

Fighting

     * Two people were killed in Russian attacks on the eastern Ukrainian
       town of Avdiivka, officials said, and two others were killed in
       shelling of Beryslav city in Ukraine’s Kherson region.
     * Russian forces continued their assault on Avdiivka, repeatedly
       shelling the town and launching ground operations in one of the few
       offensives by Russian forces in months.

     * Ukraine’s military said it had withstood 15 Russian ground attacks
       mounted in the vicinity of Avdiivka, Tonenke and Pervomaiske in the
       Donetsk region. The fierce Russian onslaught around Avdiivka has
       been described as a new offensive by Moscow.
     * Ukraine military spokesperson Oleksandr Stupun said Avdiivka was
       now a key objective for Russian forces to take “because it is the
       only chance to show some kind of victory. They have no other
       options.”
     * Almost 30 Ukrainian combat drones were shot down by Russian air
       defences over Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions. Two additional
       drones were shot down over the Black Sea near the southern Russian
       resort city of Sochi. There were no reports of casualties
       immediately.
     * Russia’s Black Sea Fleet conducted drills using rocket launchers
       off the port city of Sevastopol in the Russian-annexed Crimean
       Peninsula.

Regional security

     * The White House accused North Korea of delivering more than 1,000
       containers of military equipment and munitions to Russia for its
       ongoing war in Ukraine. Washington released images that it said
       showed the containers being loaded onto a Russian-flagged ship
       before being moved by train to southwestern Russia. North Korea has
       previously denied providing weaponry to Moscow.

Diplomacy

     * Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet China’s Xi Jinping at
       the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing on October 17-18. Putin’s visit
       to China is his first international trip since The Hague-based
       International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant for his arrest
       in March for war crimes related to the deportation of children from
       Ukraine.

     * Armenian President Vahagn Khachaturyan ratified the ICC statutes,
       his office said.
     * Ukrainian human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said the Foreign
       Ministry in Kyiv sent a note of protest to Israel after Ukrainian
       citizens were unable to evacuate from war-torn Gaza. Lubinets said
       Ukraine could not understand why its citizens, and those of other
       countries, were not allowed to evacuate from besieged and bombarded
       Gaza. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been a vocal
       supporter of Israel in its war on Gaza.

Sanctions

     * World Athletics President Sebastian Coe said the International
       Olympic Committee (IOC) had made the “only decision left open” in
       suspending Russia’s national Olympic body for violating the
       territorial integrity of Ukraine. The IOC decision came after
       Russia’s Olympic Committee this week officially recognised regional
       sporting organisations from four Ukrainian territories annexed by
       Russia since its invasion of Ukraine began in 2022.

   Is this the beginning of the end of the war in Ukraine?

Is this the beginning of the end of the war in Ukraine?

   The Western media is suddenly teeming with signs of fatigue and even
   .... diplomacy?

   “I don’t think that [the war] is a stalemate,” Ukrainian president
   Volodymyr Zelensky told NBC News’ Meet the Press on Sunday.

   “They thought they would checkmate us, but,” he insisted, “this didn’t
   happen.” According to recent interviews, his military leadership
   disagrees. His political inner circle thinks his insistence is
   delusional.

   Zelensky is facing pressure both from within Ukraine and from without.
   Growing pressure from within is coming from both the political and
   military leadership; growing pressure from without is coming from
   Ukraine’s key partners.

   The battle is largely being played out in the Western media. Most
   intimately, Zelensky has faced criticism from his political inner
   circle. TIME magazine reports that some of the president’s advisors
   have become worried that his “belief in Ukraine’s ultimate victory over
   Russia . . . “verg[es] on the messianic.” One of Zelensky’s “closest
   aides” said that Zelensky “deludes himself.” The aide complained,
   “We’re out of options. We’re not winning. But try telling him that.”

   Some Zelensky aides say his intransigence hampers Ukraine’s ability to
   adapt to the changed reality on the battlefield and worry that
   negotiating a settlement with Russia remains “taboo.”

   Domestic criticism is also coming from the top levels of the military.
   Zelensky is reportedly in conflict with his generals over the conduct
   of the counteroffensive and over his demands to defend Bakhmut and
   Avdiivka at any cost, which the military leadership sees as a strategic
   mistake that is already hurting Ukraine dearly in soldiers and
   equipment.

   A senior Ukrainian military officer said that orders from the
   president’s office are, at times, disconnected from the battlefield
   reality and defended some front-line commanders who have begun
   second-guessing and refusing “orders from the top.”

   Zelensky’s struggle with his generals intensified on November 3 when
   Zelensky fired General Viktor Khorenko, the commander of Ukraine’s
   special operations forces. The commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian
   army, General Valery Zaluzhny, did not request his dismissal. The New
   York Times reports that “It was unclear whether General Zaluzhny, the
   overall commander of Ukraine’s forces, knew in advance of the planned
   dismissal” and that “[t]he firing appeared to undercut General
   Zaluzhny’s authority.”

   The firing took U.S. military officers, who “described a close and
   effective working relationship with” Khorenko, by surprise. Khorenko’s
   special operations forces had had some success with long-range strikes
   and sabotage operations behind Russian lines. But the NYT reports that
   there had been tension over what the military had “perceived as
   politically guided decisions on strategy” that had been ineffective and
   costly.

   Zelensky’s tensions with his generals reached a peak with Zaluzhny’s
   November 1 interview with The Economist. He asserted that the war had
   reached a “stalemate.” He conceded that “There will most likely be no
   deep and beautiful breakthrough.”

   What’s worse is that Zaluzhny implied that the stalemate would evolve
   into defeat for Ukraine. A stalemate entails a long war of attrition.
   In a companion essay published simultaneously by The Economist, he
   explained that a long war “as a rule, in most cases, is beneficial to
   one of the parties to the conflict. In our particular case, it is the
   russian [sic] federation, as it gives it the opportunity to
   reconstitute and build up its military power.”

   Zaluzhny said that in a prolonged war, Ukraine will run out of the
   “required volume” of missiles and ammunition while Russia, despite
   sanctions, is increasing its production capabilities. And even if it
   didn’t run out of weapons, he added, it will run out of men: a war of
   attrition “leads to the lack of Ukraine's ability to achieve
   superiority over the enemy in reserves by increasing their number.” A
   close Zelensky aide told TIME that, even if the United States gave
   Ukraine all the weapons it needed, Kyiv doesn’t “have the men to use
   them.”

   Zelensky’s office censured Zaluzhny, saying it “eases the work” of
   Russia and stirs “panic” among Ukraine’s Western partners. The New York
   Times calls the censure “a striking public rebuke that signaled an
   emerging rift between the military and civilian leadership.”

   In addition to the pressure coming from within Zelensky’s inner
   political and military circle, diplomatic pressure is also coming from
   Zelensky’s international partners.

   A November 3 NBC News article reported that “U.S. and European
   officials have begun quietly talking to the Ukrainian government about
   what possible peace negotiations with Russia might entail to end the
   war.” The article went on to say, citing one current and one former
   senior U.S. official familiar with the discussions, that “the
   conversations have included very broad outlines of what Ukraine might
   need to give up to reach a deal.”

   The quiet talks suggest agreement by the U.S. and its European allies
   with Zaluzhny that Ukraine may not achieve its goals on the
   battlefield, that the realization of their aspirations may continue to
   dim with prolonged battle, and that some concessions may need to be
   made.

   There is a remarkable convergence in the language used by the U.S. and
   European officials and the language used by Zaluzhny and Zelensky’s
   aides. NBC reports that the conversations “began amid concerns among
   U.S. and European officials that the war has reached a stalemate.” NBC
   reports that, like Zaluzhny, “[s]ome U.S. military officials have
   privately begun using the term ‘stalemate’ to describe the current
   battle in Ukraine.”

   Like Zaluzhny and Zelensky’s aides, “Biden administration officials
   also are worried that Ukraine is running out of forces.” According to
   “people familiar with the matter,” NBC reported, “President Joe Biden
   has been intensely focused on Ukraine’s depleting military forces.”
   “Manpower,” one of those sources is quoted as saying, “is at the top of
   the administration’s concerns right now.”

   Echoing the “close Zelensky aide” quoted in TIME, the same source said,
   “The U.S. and its allies can provide Ukraine with weaponry, but if they
   don’t have competent forces to use them it doesn’t do a lot of good.”

   These concerns, NBC reported, have led U.S. officials to concede
   privately that “Ukraine likely only has until the end of the year or
   shortly thereafter before more urgent discussions about peace
   negotiations should begin.”

   That leaves only a couple of months. With the battlefield turning
   against Ukraine despite Zelensky’s intransigent “belief in Ukraine’s
   ultimate victory over Russia,” the pressure targeted at Zelensky seems
   to be building, from both within and without,, to turn to the
   diplomatic front and face the beginning of the end of the war.

   Israel-Hamas deal: Talking vs. bombing, works

Israel-Hamas deal: Talking vs. bombing, works

   Trita Parsi
   November 22, 2023
   Middle East

   The agreement reached today between Israel and Hamas — and brokered by
   Qatar and Egypt — is an important first step that will hopefully give
   all sides an opportunity to step back from the precipice of a larger
   regional conflagration, and to consider options for ending this war
   other than by the military destruction of one another.

   The return of the hostages to Israel in exchange for the return of
   Palestinian prisoners is welcome news and hopefully will proceed
   through subsequent cycles until all the hostages have been returned.
   The exchange proves that solutions can only be found through diplomacy
   through the help of actors in the region who can talk to all sides, in
   this case, Qatar and Egypt.

   This agreement should also serve as a wake-up call to the United States
   about the viability of a ceasefire, in both policy and political terms.
   President Joe Biden could and should have used political leverage
   sooner to secure this deal. For the sake of the Israeli hostages, for
   the sake of the thousands of Palestinian civilians who have been killed
   by this delay, and for the sake of the longer-term peace: Every
   Palestinian or Israeli child or civilian killed pushes peace further
   and further into the future.

   And finally, for the sake of preventing a widening of the war that
   could drag the US into yet another military conflict in the Middle
   East.

   It is crucial that this agreement is not treated by Biden as an
   alternative to a ceasefire. Rather, it must be treated as the first
   step towards it.

   If it amounts to nothing more than a prelude to a resumption of the
   military campaign and a continuation of the siege, it will not make
   much of a difference in stemming the larger humanitarian crisis,
   preventing a regional war, or paving the way for real peace.

   The U.S. has already lost significant international standing through
   its opposition to a ceasefire. If Biden fails to press all parties for
   a ceasefire after the prisoner swap, America’s global standing will
   plummet even further, which will have dire consequences for the U.S.,
   including in Ukraine.

   US strikes in Iraq show risk of escalation to wider war

US strikes in Iraq show risk of escalation to wider war

   Adam Weinstein
   November 22, 2023
   QiOSK

   The United States has conducted two retaliatory airstrikes against
   Iraqi militias this week after ballistic missile attacks against
   America’s Al Asad Air Base, the latest in a troubling tit-for-tat
   between the U.S. and Iran-backed militias in the region that was
   triggered by the Israel-Hamas conflict.

   CENTCOM appears to believe that the status quo of attack and reprisal
   with Iraqi militias is sustainable. There’s an assumption that
   Washington, Iran, and Iraq’s militias understand each other’s red
   lines. However, this assumption comes with a lot of risks.

   The potential for one-upmanship between various Shi’a militias, each
   trying to prove they’re more hostile toward Americans than the others,
   is a concerning possibility. A deadly attack on U.S. troops could
   prompt the Biden administration to respond more forcefully, especially
   in an election year. What is the administration’s plan to manage
   escalation and prevent a larger regional war (with heavy U.S.
   involvement) if this were to occur?

   While the timing and scale of the war in Gaza may have been
   unpredictable, it was always evident that the presence of scattered
   U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria posed a risk of escalating the U.S. into
   greater conflict in such an unpredictable region. That’s why I’ve long
   argued for rethinking America’s military posture in Iraq, including in
   new research this year exploring how Washington could conduct a phased
   withdrawal of troops and successfully recalibrate our approach to the
   country and region.

   It is true that the presence of U.S. military advisors in Iraq helps
   maintain cohesion and a working relationship between competing factions
   of Iraq’s military. U.S. troops also offer critical capabilities in the
   fight to contain ISIS. But it is time for Washington to consider
   whether these benefits are outweighed by the risk of malign actors
   using U.S. troops to provoke a wider conflict – either intentionally or
   inadvertently.

   While the risks of keeping U.S. troops in Iraq are apparent, the
   overall utility of their presence is unclear (particularly in deterring
   attacks on themselves). With each new day comes a fresh opportunity for
   crisis. It’s past time Washington grappled with the true costs and
   benefits of our military presence.

   JFK: A man on the brink of revelation

JFK: A man on the brink of revelation

   Lora Lumpe
   November 22, 2023
   QiOSK

   Sixty years ago today, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in
   Dallas, Texas.

   According to his biographer, Arthur Schlesinger, Kennedy’s thinking had
   evolved in the year before his killing. In an obituary in The Saturday
   Evening Post on December 14, 1963, Schlesinger said this about the
   president in those last months:

   “What preoccupied him most, I believe, was the peace of the world and
   the future of mankind. His historian’s perspective made him see the
   conflict with Communism not as a holy war but as a difficult and
   perilous struggle for adjustment and accommodation. The world, he
   deeply believed, was in its nature and its historical movement a
   diverse world — a world which had room for great diversity of economic
   systems, of political creeds, of philosophic faiths. He respected the
   distinctive values and traditions, the distinctive identities, of other
   nations and other societies.

   Above all, life must survive on this planet. He knew what nuclear war
   would mean, and he believed that the avoidance of such a war was the
   common interest of mankind — a common interest which must transcend all
   conflicts of ideology and national ambition. This common interest was
   the bridge across the dark abyss. His deepest purpose was to strengthen
   that bridge against storms of suspicion and fear, and to persuade his
   adversaries that, if each nation and people respected the integrity of
   the rest and accepted the reality of the world of diversity, if nations
   abandoned a messianic effort to remake the world in their own image,
   peace would be possible, and humanity would endure."

   This is a far cry from President Joe Biden’s "good vs evil" and
   "dictators vs. democrats" rhetoric of today. Interestingly, it bears
   resemblance to Chinese President Xi Jinping's comment last week when
   meeting with Biden:

   "Planet Earth is big enough for the two countries to succeed, and one
   country’s success is an opportunity for the other. It is an objective
   fact that China and the United States are different in history,
   culture, social system, and development path. However, as long as they
   respect each other, coexist in peace, and pursue win-win cooperation,
   they will be fully capable of rising above differences and find the
   right way for the two major countries to get along with each other."

   It is also worth noting that Kennedy only five months before Dallas had
   given what some have called one of the most enduring speeches of his
   time. On June 10, 1963, he asked the American University commencement
   audience, “what kind of peace do we seek?”

   "So, let us not be blind to our differences but let us also direct
   attention to our common interests and to the means by which those
   differences can be resolved. And if we cannot end now our differences,
   at least we can help make the world safe for diversity. For, in the
   final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this
   small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our
   children's future. And we are all mortal."

   Sixty years and more than a generation ago these words held promise,
   then seemingly lost amid the chaos of assassination, and war. There is
   no cost to resurfacing them now, in a world no less uncertain.

   Galina with her sewing machine and Russian passport
   Image caption,
   As a legal Russian, Galina says she can't get a job and fears her bank
   account could be blocked
   By James Waterhouse
   BBC Ukraine Correspondent

   Galina was born in Ukraine. She speaks Ukrainian, her husband is
   serving in the Ukrainian army, and she lives in a village south of the
   central Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia.

   But Galina is legally Russian. As a child, she moved there, where she
   then became a citizen.

   It means she - like thousands of other Russians in Ukraine - is now in
   a legal limbo.

   "When you show your documents, people think you're something strange,"
   she tells me in her kitchen, where she spends her time stitching
   T-shirts for wounded Ukrainian soldiers.

   Ukraine's state migration service insists that all foreigners in
   Ukraine have equal rights as each other, and no one nationality is
   discriminated against.

   But some allege this isn't the case. Lawyers working with Russians in
   Ukraine for instance told the BBC their clients face having their
   accounts frozen.

   After Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Ukraine's National Bank
   restricted financial services for all Russian and Belarusian citizens,
   although it says those with a residence permit are not affected.

   Galina disagrees. She says that because of her passport, she can't get
   a job, and fears her bank account could be blocked.

   She is seven months pregnant but because she's not legally Ukrainian,
   she can't access free state health services.

   Galina also worries she won't be able to register her child's birth:
   after she married her Ukrainian husband Maksym in a church, she says
   that officials refused to recognise the union because of her unsettled
   status.

   "They said, 'Come back when you have a passport'," explains Galina.
   "They can't understand who I am." Under Ukrainian law it's banned to
   have joint citizenship, although some do.

   Image caption,
   Makysm and Galina had a church wedding but it is not legally recognised
   because of Galina's unsettled status

   She started applying to become a Ukrainian citizen but was unable to
   complete the process because of Russia's full-scale invasion. Now
   Galina's temporary Ukrainian passport has expired, she says she feels
   like a "hostage of Russia".

   "Changing passports was difficult even before the war - now it's
   impossible," she says.

   On Povitroflotskyi Avenue in central Kyiv sits a three-storey white
   building with an overgrown garden. It's surrounded by a tall, barbed
   wire fence and the shutters are firmly down.

   They have been since 23 February last year when staff at the Russian
   Embassy evacuated for "safety reasons". A day later Moscow launched its
   full-scale invasion, and what was left of the diplomatic relations
   between Kyiv and Moscow disintegrated.

   It means thousands of people in Ukraine, like Galina, are living in
   uncertainty.

   Currently there are more than 150,000 Russians with permanent residency
   permits in Ukraine. Around 17,000 have temporary ones.

   For them to successfully apply for a Ukrainian passport or citizenship,
   they first need to physically give up their Russian citizenship. Moscow
   made that process complicated: to do so, they'd have to surrender their
   papers in either a Russian consulate abroad, or Russia itself.

   There are no guarantees Galina wouldn't be arrested in the process, or
   end up stranded outside Ukraine.

   Image caption,

   full-scale invasion

   As Galina's children arrive back from school, you can see the anguish
   in her eyes. An anxiety she attempts to hide from her children.

   But she refuses to hold Ukraine accountable, or to claim
   discrimination.

   She pins all her blame on Russia for her situation, as well as her
   Russian family members who've chosen to support their country in its
   so-called "special military operation".

   "How can I support a robber, a rapist and a murderer who breaks into my
   home?" she says.

   After Galina finishes a video call with her husband Maksym, I ask her
   what would happen to her family if he was killed on the front line.

   She puts her hand over her mouth. A thought she's tried to put to the
   back of her mind, suddenly at the forefront.

   "It's very scary," she says. "Even if he gets wounded, I wouldn't be
   able to visit him in hospital, because we're not technically married."

   "To the rest of the world we're strangers."

'I chose Ukraine'

   When Anastasia Leonova, a Russian, moved from Moscow to Kyiv in 2015,
   her friends warned her she "wouldn't be allowed to speak Russian" and
   that "there were only Nazis there".

   It was a Russian propaganda narrative which annoyed her, as she had
   uncles and cousins living in Ukraine.
   Anastasia
   Image caption,

   Anastasia's relocation followed her online criticism of Russia's 2014
   annexation of Crimea and backing of separatist militants, which led to
   her losing her job in Russia as well as receiving death threats.

   On 24 February last year, as Russian troops moved towards Kyiv,
   Anastasia says she only had one thought in her mind - to stay and
   fight.

   "My blood is part Ukrainian," she says. "I was born as a part of
   Ukraine."

   "I chose Ukraine as my homeland; I could not betray this choice".

   She volunteered to be a combat medic with Ukrainian forces, as they
   defended the capital against troops from her own country.

   I ask whether she's treated differently for being Russian.

   "Nobody was asking for my passport when I was working," she says with a
   smile.

   "For sure, my colleagues know."
   Russian passports
   Image caption,

   surrender them at an embassy or consulate

   She admits it was initially very difficult to treat wounded Russians
   because of what they were doing.

   But later, she says, she realised that treating them was "the way to
   get our people back, the Ukrainians who were captured by the Russians".

   "Since I came here from my first day, I've been dreaming of having a
   Ukrainian passport," she says.

   "This is what I'm fighting for. Not only for freedom, but for my
   passport."

   Only a few hundred Russians have been granted Ukrainian citizenship in
   the 18 months since the full-scale invasion, down from 1,700 the year
   before.

   Unlike Galina, Anastasia feels she's closer to her dream. Serving the
   army has likely helped her cause.

   Military service, marriage to a Ukrainian and length of residency are
   all considered in citizenship applications. As the authorities point
   out, having the legal right to stay in Ukraine requires more than just
   a change in identity.

   This war has put thousands of Russians like Galina and Anastasia in a
   difficult position within Ukraine.

   The head of Ukraine's State Migration Service, Natalia Naumenko, told
   us no nationality is discriminated against when it comes to gaining
   citizenship.

   A new law is being drafted which would simplify citizenship and
   residency applications for those fighting for Ukraine.

   But Ms Naumenko points out that thanks to the full-scale invasion, the
   process certainly won't be made easier for Russians.

   "We have already simplified it for those who are fighting for Ukraine,"
   she says.

   "Why does Ukraine have to simplify it for all Russians in general?"

   The beginning of the conflict in Ukraine in early 2022 represents a
   notable intensification of longstanding tensions that have persisted
   since 2014, particularly in the aftermath of Russia’s annexation of
   Crimea and the subsequent fighting in Eastern Ukraine. The ongoing
   conflict, which has lasted for over 20 months, has transformed into a
   protracted and violent struggle that surpasses original projections,
   resulting in a multifaceted humanitarian, political, and military
   predicament. The areas of conflict, spanning throughout Ukraine, are
   characterized by continuous artillery exchanges and substantial changes
   in territorial control, which undermine the chances for achieving
   peace. The conflict in Ukraine has resulted in a situation where all
   parties involved have established strong positions. Ukraine, with
   substantial backing from Western countries, is actively opposing the
   Russian attack. Nevertheless, against several obstacles and intense
   opposition, the Russian military continues its operations, resulting in
   a prolonged state of deadlock.

   The extent of human casualties resulting from this battle is
   substantial. The loss of life has resulted in a significant
   humanitarian disaster, with many casualties and a substantial number of
   people being displaced, reaching into the millions. The conflict in
   Ukraine has had a lasting impact on urban and rural areas, resulting in
   significant damage to infrastructure and the fragmentation of
   communities. The protracted conflict at hand serves as a manifestation
   of profound political, historical, and cultural frictions between
   Ukraine and Russia, therefore illustrating the intricate nature of
   contemporary warfare, whereby continuing fights are propelled by
   geopolitical ambitions, nationalistic sentiments, and ideological
   disparities. The engagement of external countries, each driven by
   geopolitical objectives, adds complexity to diplomatic efforts aimed at
   finding settlements.

   The impediments of the conflict extend beyond the territorial
   boundaries of Ukraine, exerting a significant impact on several facets
   of world affairs, including political dynamics, economic conditions,
   and security considerations. The aforementioned event has resulted in
   the most significant mobilization and reorganization of NATO troops
   since the end of the Cold War, therefore altering the structure of
   European security. From an economic standpoint, the war has adverse
   effects on global supply chains, namely in the oil and agricultural
   sectors, hence exacerbating inflationary pressures and fostering an
   atmosphere of uncertainty in the global economy. The ongoing crisis in
   Ukraine has sparked a widespread discussion on the concepts of
   sovereignty, international law, and the rules-based order at a global
   level. This has led governments to reevaluate their foreign policies
   and alliances, resulting in significant changes to the dynamics of
   global power. The ongoing regional war has evolved into a worldwide
   crisis, resulting in significant consequences that have had a profound
   impact on international relations and global stability.

   The reaction from the international community has shown a diverse range
   of approaches. The imposition of sanctions on Russia, spearheaded by
   Western countries, is intended to isolate Moscow and diminish its
   military capabilities. The aforementioned entities that have been
   affected by these attacks include Russian banks, enterprises, and
   authorities. Simultaneously, Ukraine has been the recipient of
   significant assistance, including military help from the United States,
   member states of the European Union, and other nations, in addition to
   extensive humanitarian support directed towards refugees. The United
   States has played a crucial role in mobilizing international support
   for Ukraine, spearheading the implementation of sanctions against
   Russia, and offering substantial military assistance. The European
   Union (EU) strategically manages its relationship with Ukraine while
   also considering its energy reliance on Russia. China, in its pursuit
   of a strategic cooperation with Russia, emphasizes the need of
   upholding principles such as respect for sovereignty and territorial
   integrity. Countries such as India place significant emphasis on the
   use of conversation and diplomacy as key approaches to address
   international issues.

   The goal of peace negotiations has encountered significant
   difficulties, as seen by the ongoing diplomatic discussions, including
   those initiated by the United Nations, which have so far failed to
   produce a satisfactory result. The intricate nature of the conflict and
   the varying goals of the parties involved have hindered the process of
   peace-building. The European security dynamics have undergone a
   significant transformation as a result of the conflict, leading to
   NATO’s reinforcement of its eastern flank and member states’ heightened
   military expenditures. The events outlined above highlight the need for
   a reevaluation of the collective defense principle and have sparked
   thoughtful discussions on the idea of European strategic autonomy
   within academic groups. In addition to permanently altering the face of
   international relations, this battle has sparked a worldwide
   reevaluation of power dynamics and reignited academic discussions on
   territorial integrity and national sovereignty. In response,
   governments are carefully reevaluating their relationships and
   adjusting their foreign policy goals in light of these significant
   changes.

   The conflict’s effects are seen throughout the world’s energy markets
   and supply, especially in light of Europe’s reliance on Russian energy
   supplies. As a result, there is a noticeable academic emphasis on
   promoting energy source diversity as a critical strategic move to
   lessen this reliance. The ensuing upheavals have been crucial in
   amplifying worldwide inflation rates and giving rise to economic
   instability on a worldwide level, offering researchers enough material
   for comprehensive examination. The continuing refugee crisis, which has
   resulted in the mass displacement of millions of Ukrainians, further
   complicates the geopolitical situation and poses difficult problems for
   host countries. Academics are investigating the complex effects of this
   crisis on these countries and examining the stresses it places on their
   socio-political and economic structures. The crisis in Ukraine has had
   a significant impact on the country’s healthcare system, which has
   drawn attention from academics who are studying the implications of
   public health crises and the difficulties in responding to them.

   Scholars are examining the strategic use of disinformation campaigns
   and the deft use of social media platforms as tools of influence to
   shape public opinion and policy choices in the context of information
   warfare. Scholarly examination of the media’s information-dissemination
   function reveals a range of viewpoints shaped by the geopolitical
   biases of various countries. The need for achieving a peaceful
   settlement is of utmost importance for ensuring the future stability of
   Ukraine as well as the global order.

   Press Release

Amidst the war, Ukraine’s First Mental Health Forum Hosts Hundreds in Kyiv

   23 October 2023

   KYIV, UKRAINE, 20 October 2023 – A first of its kind hybrid forum
   titled "Moving Towards Mental Health System &amp; Services of the Future: A
   Case of Building Back and Forward Better in Ukraine" wrapped up its
   three-day run in Kyiv today.

   Organized by World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coordination
   Center for Mental Health of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, the
   forum brought together over 400 participants, with over two thousand
   more joining online. These included representatives of government
   agencies and non-governmental sector, local and international
   organizations, mental health experts from Ukraine and a number of
   countries - France, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, the United
   Kingdom, Belgium, Slovakia, Canada, as well as from WHO headquarters
   and the WHO Regional Office for Europe.

   "Our task and the task of such forums is to establish horizontal
   cooperation. We need to understand who refers to whom and where if
   necessary. Who should “pick up” and provide the exact assistance a
   person needs,” said Ukraine’s Minister of Health Dr. Viktor Liashko
   during the welcoming panel.

   The event served as a platform for showcasing global best practices,
   fostering the exchange of experiences, and crafting innovative
   solutions through cross-sectoral dialogue to address the pressing issue
   of mental health amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine.

   "Cooperation is important not only at the national but also at the
   international level,” said Vice Prime Minister and the Minister for
   Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine Iryna
   Vereshchuk. “Exchange of experience, coordination of efforts - all this
   is to ensure that all humanitarian resources sent to Ukraine go to
   where they are most needed.”

   The Forum hosted presentations, panel discussions, workshops,
   interactive zones, and a marketplace where participating organizations
   presented their achievements and developments in the area of mental
   health. Discussions spinned the entire spectrum of mental health care -
   from awareness raising and fostering a culture of self-help to human
   rights and engagement of people with lived experience of mental health
   conditions.

   "I am confident that the Forum will contribute to innovative solutions
   helping ensure that every Ukrainian has access to quality mental health
   services. We are continuing to make tremendous progress in spite of the
   ongoing war, and I am grateful to all the partners for coming together
   to make this work possible," added Dr. Jarno Habicht, WHO
   Representative in Ukraine.

   The Forum is held within the framework of the All-Ukrainian Mental
   Health Program, created and implemented at the initiative of First Lady
   of Ukraine Olena Zelenska.

   “Addressing the immense trauma and mental health impact of this war
   cannot wait. It is important to bring humanitarian supplies, but they
   need to be better connected to health care services and mental health
   support”, Denise Brown, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in
   Ukraine.

   Here is the situation on Saturday, October 21, 2023.

Fighting

     * A man was killed and a woman was left in a critical condition after
       a Russian missile hit homes in Kryvyi Rih in the central Ukrainian
       region of Dnipropetrovsk.
     * Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the south of the
       country where he said his armed forces had repelled a new Russian
       offensive against the eastern town of Avdiivka and Ukrainian forces
       were holding their ground.
     * Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the headquarters of
       Russia’s Southern Military District, located less than 100km (60
       miles) from Ukraine’s southeastern border. Putin was briefed on the
       war by the Chief of the General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, the
       Kremlin said.

     * The Ukrainian military said fighting was raging along the front
       line, with about 90 combat clashes in the past 24 hours. That
       compares with an average of about 60 daily clashes a week ago.
     * Russian forces have intensified attacks around Avdiivka and
       Kupiansk. Kyiv said the military aim of the Russian attacks around
       Avdiivka and Kupiansk was to draw in Ukrainian troops from other
       front lines and to try to gain ground before winter sets in.
     * The Institute for the Study of War, a US-based think tank, said
       Ukrainian forces appeared to have broken through on the eastern
       bank of the Dnipro river in Kherson.
     * Kyiv has not commented and Russia’s defence ministry said it had
       thwarted attempts by Ukrainian troops to establish a foothold on
       the Russian-controlled bank of the Dnipro river.
     * Russia named a replacement for the former head of the country’s
       Aerospace Forces. State media reported that Colonel General Viktor
       Afzalov, acting head of the air force, had officially replaced
       General Sergei Surovikin  – who came under suspicion following the
       revolt by Wagner mercenaries against Moscow’s military leaders
       earlier this year.

Politics

     * Russia ordered Russian American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva to be
       detained for three additional days, after prosecutors said she had
       failed to register as a “foreign agent”. Kurmasheva, who works for
       the US-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty media outlet, was
       detained by law enforcement officers in the Russian city of Kazan.
     * Kyiv’s iconic Motherland statue representing a female warrior
       towering over the capital has reopened for public viewing after its
       Soviet-era hammer and sickle emblem was replaced with the Ukrainian
       trident.

Diplomacy

     * Biden and European Union leaders delivered a message of support for
       both Ukraine and Israel. “These conflicts show democracies must
       stand together,” European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen
       said of both countries. Biden said: “We stood together to support
       the brave people of Ukraine in the face of Putin’s aggression.
       We’re standing together now to support Israel in the wake of
       Hamas’s appalling terrorist attack.”

     * Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed claims by
       Ukrainian officials that Moscow has profited from the Israel-Hamas
       war, which had taken public attention away from Ukraine.

Military aid

     * Biden requested urgent military aid for Ukraine and Israel in a
       massive $106bn security package, which includes $61bn in military
       aid for Ukraine and $14bn in military aid for Israel.
     * North Korea has condemned the US for supplying Ukraine with
       long-range ATACMS ballistic  missiles.

Regional security

     * Russia’s defence ministry released a video showing a UK
       reconnaissance above the Black Sea being intercepted by Russian
       jets to prevent it from entering Russian airspace.
     * US intelligence reported that Russia is using its spy network,
       state-run media and social media platforms to undermine public
       trust in elections around the world.
     * The International Criminal Court (ICC) said an “unprecedented”
       cyberattack it suffered in September was probably “espionage” aimed
       at undermining its work. The attack comes as Russian investigators
       have opened criminal cases against the ICC’s prosecutor and judges
       who issued an arrest warrant for Putin for war crimes earlier this
       year.

   KYIV, 22 August 2023 - Child casualties in Ukraine increased by more
   than 7% between May to August compared to the previous four months as
   air and drone attacks tripled, with no end to the danger faced by
   children after 18 months of war, Save the Children said today.

   Since May 2023, a total of 148 children have been killed or injured in
   Ukraine, bringing the number of child casualties since the escalation
   of war on 24 Feb last year to more than 1,700, according to UN data.
   This includes 545 deaths, with 24 children killed this summer.

   The month of June was the deadliest so far this year for children with
   11 children killed and 43 more injured. According to verified UN
   data,[1] there was an increase in all civilian casualties in Ukraine in
   between 1 May and 13 August with June recording the highest number of
   total civilian casualties in 2023 at 865.

   Conflict analytics reports showed that between Jan 1- April 30 there
   were 459 air and drone strikes. This rose to 1,432 between 1 May and 4
   August, with about 95% of these attacks in populated areas.

   In one such attack on the morning of 31 July, a missile hit an
   apartment block in Kryvyi Rih, Southern Dnipro, destroying five storeys
   of a high-rise building. A 10-year-old girl and her mother were killed
   in the incident, with more than 80 further reported casualties,
   including seven injured children.

   Lyudmyla’s* apartment was one of more than 250 homes damaged in the
   neighbourhood. All the windows of her family’s home were blown out by
   the explosion and the noise woke up her 18-year-old grandson.

   “He was shocked, and rushed outside straight from his bed once he heard
   the explosion. He could not even change his clothes. He later came back
   to grab documents and that is when another explosion occurred. He was
   terrified by such a loud noise,” said Lyudmyla*, 65.

   “My two other grandchildren – aged 11 and 13 – were staying with their
   mother at a relative’s house. They were just 300 metres away from the
   explosion. The windows and doors were also blown out at that apartment.
   Everyone was scared.”

   On 11 August, an 8-year-old boy was killed in Kolomyia, western
   Ukraine, after a missile struck the back garden of his family home. A
   family of four was killed by shelling in Kherson region two days later,
   including a 12-year-old boy and a baby girl just 23 days old. Just last
   week on 19 August, a six-year-old girl was among the seven people
   killed and 180 injured in an attack in the northern city of Chernihiv.

   Amjad Yamin, Save the Children’s Advocacy Director in Ukraine, said:

   “*Ukraine is 18 months into full-scale war, and there seems to be no
   reprieve from the perilous circumstances endured by children and
   families. We have witnessed numerous attacks on populated areas that
   took the lives of children and their parents, left hundreds of people
   injured or severely distressed, and damaged or destroyed homes,
   plunging thousands of families into uncertainty. *

   *“Since last February, more than 1,*700 children have been killed or
   injured due to unrelenting hostilities. The vast majority of those
   casualties are attributed to missiles and drones being fired at
   residential areas. This serves as a grim reminder that explosive
   weapons should not be used anywhere near populated areas, such as towns
   and villages.”

   Save the Children is calling on all sides to adhere to obligations
   under international humanitarian and human rights law, and ensure that
   civilians and civilian objects, especially those used by children such
   as homes, schools, and hospitals, are protected from attack.

   Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering
   humanitarian aid to children and their families affected by
   hostilities. It is also supporting refugee families across Europe and
   helping children to access education and other critical services.

Afternoon summary

   As it turns 6pm in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, here’s a roundup of today’s
   news so far:
     * Russia launched waves of drone attacks on Kyiv overnight, the head
       of the Ukrainian capital’s military administration said. Serhiy
       Popko said on Sunday that, according to preliminary information,
       Ukraine’s air defence systems hit about 10 Iranian-made Shahed
       kamikaze drones in Kyiv and its outskirts.
     * Ukrainian troops have pushed Russian forces ‘3km to 8km’ back from
       the banks of the Dnipro River. “Preliminary figures vary from three

       Russians had retreated.

   More on Vladimir Putin’s possible attendance at the G20 virtual summit
   after he skipped the in-person meeting in New Delhi in September.

   The Russian president did not travel to the last two G20 meetings –
   hosted by India in September and Indonesia last year, sending his
   foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in his place.

   In a statement on Saturday, India said its prime minister, Narendra
   Modi, would chair a virtual summit on Wednesday to “take forward key,
   select outcomes/action points from the New Delhi summit”.

   Putin has taken few trips outside Russia since the international
   criminal court issued an arrest warrant for him over the unlawful
   deportation of Ukrainian children.

Ukrainian teen taken from Mariupol returned home

   A Ukrainian orphan taken from Mariupol after Russian forces captured
   the Ukrainian city in the first weeks of its invasion has returned
   home, Kyiv said on Sunday.

   The case of Bogdan Yermokhin, who turned 18 on Sunday, made
   international headlines after Russia issued him a draft summons to
   report for mandatory military conscription before his 18th birthday.

   It was announced he would return on 10 November and today Kyiv said he
   had made it back to Ukraine after a series of negotiations involving
   officials in Moscow, Kyiv and Belarus.

   “Our team managed to bring home Bogdan Yermokhin, a Ukrainian boy who
   was taken by Russia from occupied Mariupol to the Moscow region,” said
   Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff.

   The Kremlin has been accused of illegally transferring thousands of
   Ukrainian children to Russia, and the international criminal court has
   issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin over the alleged
   deportations.

   Yermokhin’s return was brokered by Qatar and the UN children’s agency,
   Unicef, said Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets in a
   social media post.

   He also published a photo of Yermokhin holding a Ukrainian flag at the
   border.

Russia says Ukraine attempted to attack Bogorodsky area, near Moscow, using a
drone

   “An attempt by the Kyiv regime to carry out a terrorist attack using a
   drone against facilities of the Russian Federation was thwarted,” the
   Russian defence ministry said in a statement.

   Ukrainian drone attacks on Moscow were particularly frequent in the
   spring, before the launch of its counteroffensive in June, but they
   have been rare in recent weeks.

   According to the Russian ministry, the drone in question “was destroyed
   by the air defence equipment … over the territory of the Bogorodsky
   urban district, in the Moscow region”.

   Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said later on Telegram that the foiled
   attack “did not cause any damage or casualties”.

   Ukrainian authorities said two first responders were killed and at
   least seven people injured in Russian rocket strikes on the
   south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia on Saturday.

   The attacks came as Kyiv’s air force said Russia fired 38 drones at its
   territory overnight – the highest reported number in more than six
   weeks.

   Ukrainian police said Russia fired a series of rocket strikes at the
   village of Komyshuvakha, close to the frontline in the Zaporizhzhia
   region, which Russia annexed last year.

   “As a result of the first two strikes, four local residents were
   injured and a fire broke out in a residential building,” they said in a
   statement.

   “When the police and rescuers arrived at the scene, Russians conducted
   another strike. Two emergency service workers were killed, and three
   more were injured.”

Pro-war Russian nationalist Igor Girkin says he wants to run for president

   The pro-war Russian nationalist Igor Girkin, who is in custody awaiting
   trial for inciting extremism, said on Sunday he wanted to run for
   president even though he understood the March election would be a
   “sham” with the winner already clear.

   Girkin, who is also known by the alias Igor Strelkov, has repeatedly
   said Russia faces revolution and even civil war unless Vladimir Putin’s
   military leadership fights the war in Ukraine more effectively.

   A former Federal Security Service officer who helped Russia to annex
   Crimea in 2014 and then to organise pro-Russia militias in eastern
   Ukraine, Girkin said before his arrest that he and his supporters were
   entering politics.

   “I understand perfectly well that in the current situation in Russia,
   participating in the presidential campaign is like sitting down at a
   table to play with card sharps,” Girkin said in a letter published by
   his account on Telegram.

   Girkin said he did not think he would be allowed to take part in the
   election, but hoped that his attempt to unite patriotic forces would
   disrupt the Kremlin’s plan for a “sham election” in which “the only
   winner is known in advance”.

   “This is our chance to unite in the face of external and internal
   threats,” Girkin said in the post, which was titled: “I am going to
   run.”

   The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said in an interview published
   on Friday that he hoped Putin would run in the March election for
   another term as president, a move that would keep Putin in power until
   at least 2030.

Ukrainian army pushes Russians ‘3km to 8km’ away from Dnipro River

   The Ukrainian army said on Sunday that it had pushed Russian forces
   back “three to eight kilometres” from the banks of the Dnipro River,
   which if confirmed would be the first meaningful advance by Kyiv’s
   forces months into a disappointing counteroffensive.

   “Preliminary figures vary from three to eight kilometres, depending on
   the specifics, geography and landscape design of the left bank,” the
   army spokesperson Natalia Gumenyuk told Ukrainian television, without
   specifying whether Ukraine’s military had complete control of the area
   or if the Russians had retreated.

   “The enemy still continues artillery fire on the right bank,” she said,
   estimating that “several tens of thousands” of Russian troops were in
   the area.

   “We have a lot of work to do,” she added.

Ukrainian troops trying to push back Russian forces on east bank of Dnipro
River

   And now a latest update on the fight at the Dnipro River, where
   Ukrainian troops were aiming to push back Russian forces positioned on
   the east bank, the Ukrainian military says, according to the AP.

   The wide river is a natural dividing line along the southern
   battlefront. Since withdrawing from the city of Kherson and retreating
   across the river a year ago, Moscow’s forces have regularly shelled
   communities on the Ukrainian-held side of the river to prevent Kyiv’s
   troops from advancing toward Russia-annexed Crimea.

   The Ukrainians are trying to “push back Russian army units as far as
   possible in order to make life easier for the (western) bank of the
   Kherson region, so that they get shelled less,” Natalia Humeniuk, the
   spokesperson for Ukraine’s Southern Operational Command, said.

   In response, the Russian military used “tactical aviation”, including
   Iranian-made Shahed exploding drones, to try to pin down Ukraine’s
   troops, Humeniuk said.

   The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said its troops there had
   repelled 12 attacks by the Russian army between Friday and Saturday,
   the AP reports.

Drones attacked Kyiv in waves, says head of capital's military administration

   More now on those drone attacks reported in Kyiv.

   Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, explained why
   raid alerts were announced several times in the Ukrainian capital.

   “The enemy’s UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] were launched in many
   groups and attacked Kyiv in waves, from different directions, at the
   same time constantly changing the vectors of movement along the route,”
   he said, quoted by Reuters.

   After a pause of 52 days, Moscow has resumed airstrikes on Kyiv. On
   Saturday, Ukrainian officials said all drones heading towards Kyiv were
   destroyed, but some hit infrastructure elsewhere in Ukraine.

   Popko said on Sunday that according to preliminary information
   Ukraine’s air defence systems hit about 10 Iranian-made Shahed kamikaze
   drones in Kyiv and its outskirts.

   Reuters could not independently verify the reports and there was no
   immediate comment from Russia.

Russia launches waves of drone attacks on Kyiv early on Sunday

   Hello, this is the Guardian’s live coverage of the Russian war against
   Ukraine.

   Russia launched several waves of drone attacks on Kyiv early on Sunday
   for the second night in row, stepping up its assaults on the Ukrainian
   capital after several weeks of pause, the city’s military
   administration said.

   There were no initial reports of “critical damage” or casualties, said
   Serhiy Popko, the head of the Kyiv’s military administration, quoted by
   Reuters.

   Here are some more developments:
     * Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has sanctioned 37 Russian
       groups and 108 people including a former prime minister and a
       former education minister and said he aimed to fight wartime
       abductions of children from Ukraine and other “Russian terror”.
     * Ukrainian officials said on Saturday that its armed forces shot
       down 29 of 38 drones in an overnight raid. More than 400 towns and
       villages in the south, south-east and north of the country were
       affected by the drone attacks, including an oil refinery that was
       hit in Odesa.
     * Ukrainian troops are working to push back Russian forces positioned
       on the east bank of the Dnipro River, the military has said, a day
       after Ukraine claimed to have secured bridgeheads on that side of
       the river that divides the country’s partially occupied Kherson
       region.

     * Ukraine’s armed forces claimed to have killed a further 620 Russian
       soldiers on Friday during operations. In response, Russia has said
       it had heavily bombed Ukrainian forces near the Dnipro River and
       killed about 75 soldiers.
     * Two Ukrainian emergency workers were killed in the Zaporizhzhia
       region by Russian rocket attacks on Saturday. Ukrainian police said
       seven people were also injured when Russia fired a series of rocket
       strikes at the village of Komyshuvakha, close to the frontline in
       the Zaporizhzhia region, which Russia claimed to have annexed last
       year.
     * In an intelligence briefing, the UK’s Ministry of Defence noted
       Russian forces were suffering “particularly heavy casualties” in
       fighting around Avdiivka, one of three areas seeing heavy ground
       fighting. Despite the heavy fighting, the MoD said neither side was
       making significant progress.
     * Hungary must say no to the current Europe model built in Brussels,
       the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, told a congress of his Fidesz
       party on Saturday, as his government continues to object to Ukraine
       joining the EU.
     * The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has called on the Russian
       president, Vladimir Putin, to take the first step towards a
       peaceful resolution to the conflict in Ukraine by withdrawing
       troops.

   president this week in Berlin.

     * More than 100 Russian doctors have signed a joint letter calling on
       Putin to release a woman jailed for a supermarket protest against
       the war in Ukraine. A St Petersburg court last week sentenced
       Alexandra Skochilenko, 33, to seven years in prison for spreading
       “false information” after she swapped supermarket price tags with
       slogans criticising Russia’s offensive in Ukraine.
     * Ukraine has been the target of nearly 4,000 cyber-attacks since the
       invasion began, three times higher than before, according to
       Ukrainian officials who oversee cyber defences.

Russian losses in Ukraine have wiped out its advantage in Baltics, report
says

   STUTTGART, Germany — Russia’s battlefield losses in Ukraine have
   eliminated the military advantages it once held over NATO allies in the
   Baltic region, a new think tank report says.

   “Russia has effectively lost its position of power and the capacity to
   threaten its neighbors with projections of military power,” Pavel Baev
   wrote in a November report for the French Institute of International
   Relations.

   Baev, a longtime Russia expert who once worked at a research institute
   inside the Soviet Union’s defense ministry, argues many Western policy
   planners haven’t grasped the long-term implications of what the war in
   Ukraine means for security in the Baltics.

   While some in the West see Russia’s weakened position as transitional
   and a Russian comeback inevitable, Moscow sees the loss of its
   conventional military edge in the Baltics as “both unacceptable and
   irreversible,” Baev said.

   The Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were annexed by the
   Soviet Union during World War II. Since becoming independent in the
   1990s, their forces always have been far smaller and less developed
   than Russia’s.

   However, they have welcomed training with U.S. troops and other NATO
   allies, which are required to collectively defend the Baltic nations if
   they are attacked, in line with the alliance’s treaty.

   up rotations of other combat forces in the region.

   Russia’s war in Ukraine has taken an extreme toll on its military and
   challenges its ability to maintain a large force on its western flank
   with NATO, the report said. The study argues that Moscow’s strategic
   goal of turning its military exclave of Kaliningrad into a launching
   pad to dominate the central part of the Baltic region “has effectively
   been canceled.”

   Moreover, Ukraine’s ability to target Russian military infrastructure
   around Crimea has exposed weaknesses in Russia’s coastal defense weapon
   systems. Those vulnerabilities also apply to the Russian military along
   the Baltic coast.

   Beyond the tactical weaknesses, Russian capabilities were compromised
   as assets moved to the war front. Many of the Baltic units tasked with
   guarding Russia’s western border with NATO countries have been
   decimated during the nearly two years of fighting in Ukraine, according
   to the report, which cites a lengthy list of damaged units.

   “Whatever the scope of the outcome of the war, Russia will not be able
   to rebuild a position of military superiority in the Baltic theater or
   even to set an approximate balance of forces with NATO, which is
   implementing a new plan to strengthen its posture in this reconfigured
   direction,” Baev said.

   Moscow could be forced to rely more on long-range missiles and talk up
   its nuclear capability for deterrence purposes, to make up for its
   conventional military disadvantages.

   “Plain strategic logic dictates that weakness of conventional forces
   necessitates greater reliance on nuclear capabilities, and the Baltic
   theater may see applications of this logic,” the report says.

   Regardless of the outcome of the war, Russia also will need to position
   forces along its southern border with Ukraine for the long-haul, the
   report says.

   For years, the Baltics have been a focal point for the American-led
   NATO alliance, which has strengthened its position in the region amid
   concerns that it was outgunned by Russia. Many of the alliance’s
   changes were prompted by Russia’s initial 2014 intervention in Ukraine,
   which shattered old post-Cold War assumptions about a more secure
   Europe.

   In the years before 2014, many NATO militaries drastically reduced
   defense spending, shrunk the sizes of their militaries and regarded the
   prospect of large-scale conflict on the European continent as an
   anachronism.

   The U.S. military also sharply scaled back on the Continent, removing
   the last of its battle tanks from Europe just months before Russia’s
   annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula.

   The diminished NATO force prompted angst among security analysts at the
   time. Those concerns were reinforced by a large war game, carried out
   by the Rand Corp. think tank with the assistance of numerous American
   military commands between 2014 and 2015.

   It found a Russian offensive in the Baltics would overwhelm
   lesser-armed alliance forces and seize the Estonian and Latvian
   capitals in a matter of hours.

   The Rand war game, which garnered much attention at the time, said “the
   outcome was, bluntly, a disaster for NATO.”

   Since then, NATO has added multinational battlegroups in the Baltics
   and Poland and ramped up rotations of other combat forces in the
   region, including U.S. Army tank units.

   That, along with the addition of Finland into NATO and eventually
   Sweden, tipped the balance in the Baltics to NATO’s favor, Baev said.

   “With the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO, the Baltic theater
   is reconfigured so profoundly to Russia’s disadvantage that no amount
   of effort could make ‘Fortress Kaliningrad’ defensible,” the report
   said.

   A man from the Siberian region of Buryatia was sentenced to five years
   in prison after it turned out that he attempted to avoid returning to
   the war in Ukraine by acquiring a false death certificate, RFE/RL has
   learned. Zorigto Arabzhayev was mobilized and sent to Ukraine in
   November 2022 and returned on leave in the spring. When military
   officials came to his home after he failed to return to his unit, his
   son told them he had died and showed them a death certificate that
   turned out to be fake upon further investigation. Arabzhayev was
   subsequently arrested. To read the original story by RFE/RL's

   Pakistani troops have shot dead eight suspected Islamist militants
   during a firefight in the South Waziristan district of the northwestern
   Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region, the military said in a press release on
   November 27. The statement did not say what group the alleged the
   militants had belonged to, but members of the Pakistani Taliban, known
   as Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have been active in the area.
   Islamabad has accused Afghanistan's Taliban rulers of allowing TTP
   militants to use Afghan territory to launch cross-border attacks. The
   Taliban has denied the accusation. To read the original story by

   Unidentified persons wrote pro-Palestinian slogans on the walls of a
   synagogue in Uzbekistan's capital, Tashkent, the AZfront Telegram
   channel reported on November 27. The slogans appeared despite the
   authorities' claim that security has been stepped up around synagogues
   amid a warning by Israel about a possible increase in anti-Semitic
   incidents in Uzbekistan amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Late last
   month, two members of the international religious Jewish movement
   Chabad were attacked in Tashkent. The incident went unreported in
   Uzbekistan, a tightly controlled, mainly Muslim Central Asian country.

Hundreds Of Thousands Left In Dark, Cold As Massive Storms Hit Southeastern
Europe

   Heavy snowstorms in Moldova have severely disrupted traffic in the
   country.
   Heavy snowstorms in Moldova have severely disrupted traffic in the

   Blizzards, snowfall, and high winds have wreaked havoc over the past
   two days in eastern and southeastern Europe, leaving hundreds of
   thousands of people isolated and without electricity and running water,
   while traffic accidents prompted by the dangerous conditions have
   caused at least two deaths and several injuries.

   A powerful cyclone sweeping from the Black Sea brought snowfall as far
   north as Moscow in what the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia called
   “one of the strongest storms to ever hit at the end of November.”

   Ukraine, Moldova, Bulgaria, and Romania were among the hardest hit
   areas, including the Russia-annexed Crimea peninsula where one person
   died and almost half a million people were left without power after the
   storm in the Black Sea region flooded roads, unrooted trees and downed
   electricity lines.

   The Aquarium Museum in the Russia-annexed city of Sevastopol reported
   that the storm tore through the complex, killing all of the 800 or so
   animals housed in the facility.

   A storm warning remains in effect in Crimea due to wind gusts of up to
   40 meters per second and November 27 was declared a day off, the
   Interfax news agency reported.

   A Russian-installed official in Ukraine's Crimea peninsula said that
   one person had been killed and others injured as severe storms left
   more than half a million people without electricity and heat in the
   region that Moscow illegally annexed in 2014.

   In war-wracked Ukraine, inclement weather added to people's hardships
   caused by Russian strikes on the country's energy infrastructure.

   Heavy snowfall across the whole country prompted the closure of 14
   highways while 16 of Ukraine's 24 regions were experiencing power cuts.
   Especially harsh conditions were reported in the southern regions of
   Odesa and Mykolayiv, where snow drifts as high as two meters hampered
   traffic.

   The Ukrainian Interior Ministry said a total of 2,019 settlements in 16
   regions have been left without electricity, while 1,370 trucks remain
   stranded, and 840 cars had to be towed.

   Authorities in Romania and neighboring Moldova said hundreds of cities
   and villages have been left without electricity and water in the two
   neighboring countries following heavy snowfall and blizzards that
   prompted a severe disruption of road and railway traffic.

   Railway traffic has resumed in southeastern Romania but 21 national
   highways remain closed as of November 27, authorities said, while
   schools in five southeastern counties -- Braila, Galati, Tulcea,
   Calarasi, and Constanta were also closed.

   A total of 22 counties out of 41 and 170 villages and cities in the
   southeast of the country, including Bucharest, were affected by power
   cuts.

   In Moldova, 123,000 people from almost 200 localities were left without
   electricity. One man died when his car veered off the snow-covered road
   and hit a tree on November 26, police said, adding that several other
   traffic accidents had been reported.

   Sixteen Moldovans were injured when the bus they were traveling on
   overturned during a blizzard on a highway in southern Romania, police
   said. Emergency services transported several injured people to the
   hospital.

   In Bulgaria, snowfall and blizzards prompted authorities to declare a
   state of emergency in several areas in the northeast of the country --
   in the Silistra and Razgrad regions, the Valchi dol municipality, the
   Varna region, and the Shumen region.

   Some 1,000 settlements were without electricity, Prime Minister Nikolay
   Denkov said at an emergency government meeting on November 26.

   damages or casualties. Smolensk houses a military aviation factory.

   on November 26 that it had repelled an attack by 24 Ukrainian drones on
   the Tula, Kaluga, and Bryansk, and Moscow regions.

One Killed, 21 Injured In Suicide Attack On Market In Pakistan

   [X]
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   One person was killed and 21 others were injured, including Pakistani
   soldiers, in a suicide attack on November 26 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
   Province in northwestern Pakistan, authorities said.

   The suicide bomber drove a car into security forces in a market in
   Bannu, two officials with the police and intelligence agencies told
   RFE/RL’s Radio Mashaal on the condition of anonymity because they were
   not authorized to speak to the media.

   They said the dead person was a civilian and that 13 soldiers and other
   civilians were among the injured who were taken to the hospital. The
   officials did not provide any other information, and there has been no
   claim of responsibility for the attack.

   The security situation in the province has worsened in recent months
   despite promises by the government and security authorities. There were
   multiple deadly incidents last week, including the killing of a
   Forestry Department employee in North Waziristan on November 23.

   One day earlier two soldiers were killed in a landmine explosion and a
   policeman was killed in an attack on a checkpoint in Khyber
   Pakhtunkhwa, while in South Waziristan on November 22, three civilians,
   including a local leader, were killed and four were injured in a bomb
   blast in Azam Worsk. No one has claimed responsibility for those
   attacks.

   The bombing in Azam Worsk occurred after two soldiers were killed in an
   armed attack on a post in Sar Rogha in South Waziristan. The Tehrik-e
   Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for that attack.

   The Pakistani government and the country's army say that they have
   continued their operations against the militants.

   The army said on November 21 that it had killed three suspected
   militants in an encounter in North Waziristan. The army added that one
   of its soldiers was also killed in the clash.

   Earlier, the army had claimed the killing of 11 suspected militants in
   clashes during operations in Peshawar and Tank in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on
   November 16.

   Pakistan's caretaker prime minister, Anwar ul-Haq Kakar, said on
   November 20 that terrorist attacks inside his country have increased by
   60 percent since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August
   2021. Some 2,300 people have been killed in these attacks.

Pope Francis Reflects On 'Tormented' Ukraine Marking Holodomor Remembrance
Day

   Pope Francis leads the Angelus prayer from Santa Marta chapel at the
   Vatican on November 26.

   Pope Francis on November 26 called the Holodomor a “lacerating wound”
   that has been made even more painful for Ukraine by the ongoing war.

   Speaking at the Vatican one day after Ukraine's Holodomor Remembrance
   Day, Francis noted that "tormented" Ukraine commemorated "the genocide
   perpetrated by the Soviet regime which, 90 years ago, caused millions
   of people to starve to death.”

   Russia on November 25 launched the largest wave of drone attacks on
   Ukraine since the start of the war as Ukraine commemorated the 1932–33
   famine in Soviet Ukraine under dictator Josef Stalin that killed
   millions.

   Ukraine said its air defenses it shot down 74 out of a total of 75
   drones launched by Russia, with Kyiv bearing the brunt of the attack.

   Pope Francis, 86, made the televised remarks from a chapel in the
   Vatican after skipping his weekly Sunday appearance at a window
   overlooking St. Peter’s Square because of what he said was a lung
   inflammation.

   The Vatican said on November 25 that Francis had to cancel all
   appointments due to a "mild flu."

   Francis urged the faithful to continue to pray tirelessly for all
   peoples torn apart by conflicts, saying that “prayer is the force of
   peace that stops the spiral of hatred” and opens unexpected paths of
   reconciliation.

   He also noted the four-day truce between Israel and Hamas, which has
   been designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the
   EU.

   “Let us thank God that there is finally a truce between Israel and
   Palestine, and some hostages have been freed. Let us pray that they
   will all be freed as soon as possible,” he said.

   The pontiff also said he would go later this week to Dubai to address
   the COP28 climate change conference, saying that besides war climate
   change is “another great danger…which puts life on Earth, especially
   for the future generations, at risk.”

   Three of the hostages released on November 26 by Hamas, which has been
   designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the EU,
   are Hungarian citizens, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said
   on Facebook.

   “I can share good news with those who are worried about the Hungarian
   hostages: thanks to the mediation of the Qatar government, new hostages
   were released today from Hamas captivity, two of them children with
   Hungarian citizenship.”

   Hungarian President Katalin Novak said in a post on X, formerly
   Twitter, that the other Hungarian released was a woman. She also
   thanked Qatar for its mediation efforts.

   A hostage who holds Russian citizenship has also been released by
   Hamas. The extremist group announced the release of the hostage on
   November 26, adding that it had taken the action in appreciation of
   Moscow's position.

   Israel and Hamas have agreed to swap 50 hostages held by Hamas for 150
   prisoners in Israeli jails over a four-day truce period.

   White House national-security adviser Jake Sullivan said earlier on
   November 26 that there was "reason to believe" a U.S. hostage would
   also be among those released.

   Russia has reportedly ordered the arrest of the chief spokesman for
   Facebook parent company Meta, accusing him of promoting terrorism. The
   decision against Andy Stone was revealed on November 26 by Russian news
   site Mediazona, which said the Justice Ministry order was made in
   February 2023. Stone, who could not be reached for comment, was
   targeted due to a policy change he announced in March 2022, less than a
   month after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The policy shift
   by Meta allowed some calls for violence against Russian invaders,
   including President Vladimir Putin, to be made on Facebook or
   Instagram, which Meta also owns. To read the original story by Current

   Russian officials said Ukraine targeted Moscow and other Russian cities
   with a fleet of at least 24 drones, claiming most were downed by
   antiaircraft systems.

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine

   RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on
   Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military
   aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's
   coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.

   Ukraine, meanwhile, reported being targeted by at least nine Russian
   drones overnight on November 26, one day after Russia launched a
   massive wave of drones against Kyiv and other sites. It was the biggest
   such attack since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February
   2022.

   The Russian Defense Ministry reported at least 24 Ukrainian drones that
   it claimed were downed over Tula, Kaluga, and Bryansk, as well as the
   Russian capital. No major damage was reported in any of the locations.

   "A mass drone attack was attempted overnight," Moscow Mayor Sergei
   Sobyanin said in a post to Telegram.

   Andrei Vorobyov, governor of the Moscow region, wrote on Telegram that
   three unspecified buildings were damaged, but there were no injuries.

   In Tula, south of Moscow, one person was wounded when an intercepted
   drone hit an apartment building, regional Governor Aleksei Dyumin said,
   also in a Telegram post.

   As of the afternoon of November 26, Ukrainian officials had made no
   immediate comment on the reported attacks.

   The Russian Army also said it had downed two Ukrainian missiles over
   the Azov Sea that it said were headed for Russia. Russia controls the
   Ukrainian Azov Sea coast, which fell to Moscow early in its offensive
   last year.

   Local authorities in the affected regions did not report casualties.

   Ukraine has upped attacks on Russia since launching its
   counteroffensive, aiming to hit regions close to fighting zones as well
   as further inland into Russia, including Moscow.

   Flights were delayed or canceled at several of Moscow’s major airports
   due to the attack, the Kommersant newspaper reported.

   Ukrainian officials made no comment on the reported attacks, which came
   one day after Russia launched its own major drone attack on the
   Ukrainian capital. Ukrainian officials said more than 70 were brought
   down or intercepted by air defenses.

   Ukraine's military said on November 26 that it had shot down eight of
   nine Russian attack drones, which targeted various locations.

   On the battlefield, fighting has focused around the industrial hub of
   Avdiyivka, which appears almost encircled by Russian forces. Its fall
   would be a significant loss for Kyiv.

   Ukraine, meanwhile, reported Russian attacks in the south and east of
   the country, saying the situation remains difficult.

   Roman Mrochko, head of the military administration in the southern city
   of Kherson, said two urban districts were shelled, while regional
   authorities said around a dozen villages were left without electricity
   due to bad weather and Russian attacks.

   Ukraine has been bracing for an expected increase in Russian attacks
   targeting its energy infrastructure now that winter weather has set in.
   That would echo Moscow's campaign last winter that, at times, left
   millions of Ukrainians in cold and darkness and destroyed critical
   power facilities.

   "Due to bad weather and Russian shelling, a number of settlements in
   our region were left without electricity," Kherson Governor Oleksandr
   Prokudin said on Telegram. "Power supply teams are already working to
   eliminate the malfunctions," he added.

   Nearly 400 localities are without electricity in Ukraine due to
   "extremely difficult" weather conditions, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy
   said.

   Oleksiy Kuleba, deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office, warned
   that the weather is worsening with heavy snowfalls expected in the
   Kyiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, and Odesa regions.

Skopje Says Blinken To Attend OSCE Summit That May Include Lavrov

   Macedonian Foreign Minister Bujar Osmani (file photo)

   (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   SKOPJE -- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is slated to attend
   the OSCE ministerial summit in Skopje on November 30-December 1, North
   Macedonia’s foreign minister said, an event that could also include the
   presence of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

   "Secretary of State Blinken has been confirmed for the informal dinner
   [on November 29]," Foreign Minister Bujar Osmani told reporters on
   November 25 in North Macedonia's capital.

   "At the informal dinner, we expect the majority of ministers. This is
   where you talk openly, without writing speeches. We have set two issues
   for the informal dinner -- aggression in Ukraine and OSCE
   functionality," Osmani said.

   Osmani's comments come a day after Skopje said it would temporarily
   lift a ban on Russian flights to the Western Balkan country to allow
   the Russian delegation to attend the summit, although overall sanctions
   will remain in place for other flights.

   Days after Moscow launched its war against Ukraine in February 2022,
   Brussels closed EU airspace to Russian flights. North Macedonia aspires
   to join the bloc.

   "The decision on EU sanctions does not relate to multilateral events
   such as the OSCE, hence the government’s decision," Osmani said.

   Lavrov has not confirmed his intentions to travel to Skopje, but he has
   indicated he would like to attend with a delegation of some 80 people.
   Skopje has invited the Russian diplomat to participate.

   Washington has not confirmed Blinken's attendance at the Skopje summit,
   but the State Department on November 25 said the secretary would travel
   to Brussels for the NATO foreign ministers meeting, which will include
   discussions on Ukraine and "emphasize our support for democracy and
   regional stability in the Western Balkans."

   U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE Michael Carpenter said in Skopje on
   November 14 that "what Russia did to Ukraine is absolutely terrible."

   "The War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity Commission is troubled by
   Mr. Lavrov's participation.... But at the end of the day, the [OSCE] is
   inclusive and has 57 member states," Carpenter said.

   capacities will speed up exports of food and other goods which Ukraine
   supplies to global markets," European Commission President Ursula von
   der Leyen wrote in a letter to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
   "Over time, our investment should allow Ukraine's ports to return to
   export quantities that were in place before the war," she added.

   24. "It is important to note that in his previously aired forced
   confession and state media report, his age was given as 18," the IHR
   said. It quoted the Tasnim news agency as saying the youth was

   Russia on November 25 unleashed the largest wave of drone attacks on
   Ukraine since the start of the war, wounding several people and causing
   damage, with Kyiv bearing the brunt of the attack, in what President
   Volodymyr Zelenskiy called "an act of willful terror."

   The attack occurred as Ukraine marked Holodomor Remembrance Day, which
   commemorates the 1932–33 man-made famine in Soviet Ukraine under
   dictator Josef Stalin that killed millions.

   "Russia launched around 70 Shahed drones at Ukraine precisely on the
   eve of the Holodomor genocide commemoration day," Zelenskiy wrote on X.

   Ukraine's air defense said in a statement that it had shot down 74 out
   of a total of 75 drones launched by Russia, with more than 60 drones
   being downed over Kyiv.

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine

   RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on
   Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military
   aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's
   coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.

   "Our warriors shot down the majority of the drones, but not all of
   them," Zelenskiy wrote. "We keep working to strengthen our air defense
   and unite the world in the fight against Russian terror. The terrorist
   state must be defeated and held accountable for its actions."
   "Russian barbarians staged the most massive drone attack on Kyiv and
   the air alert lasted six hours," Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko wrote on
   Telegram, adding that at least five people, including an 11-year-old
   child, were injured by debris from the drones shot down by air defense.
   All of them received medical treatment, he said.

   He said several districts of the capital were hit, with the most
   affected being the Solomyanskiy district, where a fire started by
   falling debris damaged a kindergarten.

   "This drone strike was the largest since the full-scale invasion
   began," the head of the Kyiv city military administration, Mykhaylo
   Shamanov, told Ukrainian television.

   The attack damaged a power line in the capital, leaving 120
   institutions and 77 residential buildings in the center of the capital
   without electricity, Kyiv's military administration said.

   The Ukrainian military's General Staff said in its November 25 evening
   report that Russia had launched 99 air strikes during the day and
   shelled Ukrainian positions and settlements 38 times with
   multiple-launch rocket systems.

   It also said there were 42 combat clashes and that the operation
   situation in the east and south "remains difficult."

   The General Staff added that Ukrainian forces had hit 11 sites of
   concentrations of Russian troops during the day.

   Ukraine has been bracing for an expected increase in Russian attacks
   targeting its energy infrastructure during the cold season in a repeat
   of Moscow's air campaign last winter that left millions of Ukrainians
   in cold and darkness and destroyed critical power facilities.

   Speaking at the Grain from Ukraine summit in Kyiv, Zelenskiy on
   November 25 said Ukraine needs more air defenses to protect its grain
   export routes.

   "There's a deficit of air defense. That is no secret," he told the
   international gathering attended by senior officials from several
   European states.

   In a separate address on the occasion of the Holodomor Remembrance Day,
   Zelenskiy called on the world to "unite and condemn the crimes of the
   past," and at the same time "unite and stop today's crimes."

   "Ninety years ago, the world could not fully see what was really
   happening [in Soviet Ukraine]. Now, there are only those who choose not
   to notice what is happening [in Moscow's unprovoked invasion of
   Ukraine]. They are not many, and they will be fewer and fewer. The
   truth is making its way," Zelenskiy said.

   The Holodomor, during which up to 4 million Ukrainians perished, has
   been recognized as genocide by almost 30 countries.

   The U.S. State Department marked the day as well, saying that "during
   Josef Stalin's regime, harsh and repressive policies were imposed upon
   Ukraine, including a deliberate famine that killed millions of innocent
   Ukrainian women, men, and children."

   "Since July, Russia has destroyed hundreds of thousands of tons of
   Ukrainian grain, along with grain infrastructure. As we remember the
   victims of the Holodomor, and we reaffirm our enduring commitment to
   Ukraine’s people, their freedom, and their democracy."

   Many of the Afghan families being driven out of Pakistan have no homes
   to return to and will struggle to feed themselves through the harsh
   winter, the UN warned on November 24. UN refugee agency UNHCR says more
   than 370,000 people have returned to Afghanistan since October 3, when
   Pakistan issued an ultimatum to the 1.7 million Afghans it says are
   living illegally in the country. "There are no open arms for these

   The government of North Macedonia on November 24 said it will allow the
   plane carrying Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to land in Skopje
   for the OSCE ministerial summit on November 30 and December 1, but
   sanctions will remain in place against Russia for all other flights.
   There has been no confirmation that Lavrov will attend the summit,
   although he has indicated his desire to travel to Skopje for the event
   with a delegation of about 80 people. Days after Moscow launched its
   war against Ukraine in February 2022, Brussels closed EU airspace to
   Russian flights. North Macedonia aspires to join the bloc. To read the

   Germany on November 24 said four local employees of its
   government-linked operator GIZ had been detained by Taliban authorities
   in Afghanistan. "I can confirm that the local employees of GIZ are in
   custody, although we have not received any official information on why
   they are detained," a spokeswoman for Germany's Ministry of Economic
   Cooperation and Development said. "We are taking this situation very
   seriously and are working through all channels available to us to
   ensure that our colleagues are released," she added. Germany closed its
   embassy in Afghanistan after the group swept back to power in 2021.

   Dutch Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren on November 24 said she hoped
   the country's military support to Ukraine would continue even under a
   new government led by anti-EU populist Geert Wilders, who has said the
   Dutch should stop providing Kyiv with arms. Wilders, whose far-right
   Freedom Party (PVV) was the clear winner of national elections this
   week, has called for the withdrawal of support, saying the Netherlands
   needs the weapons it gives to Ukraine to be able to defend itself. "In
   the Netherlands, there is broad support for our help to Ukraine,"
   Ollongren told reporters.

China, Russia, and the War in Ukraine

   The Sino-Russian relationship has become a more intractable problem for
   the transatlantic alliance. The West should continue to concentrate its
   efforts on Beijing.

Fall 2023 Issue: Toward a Wider and Deeper EU

   IPQ 4/2023

Share

   Before Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the Russia-China
   strategic partnership was becoming increasingly challenging for the
   United States and its allies. But since the war began, Chinese-Russian
   relations have presented more intractable problems for the
   transatlantic alliance. Chinese support for Russia has enabled the
   Kremlin to continue its aggression against Ukraine and has helped
   solidify the refusal of much of the Global South to condemn or sanction
   Moscow. It has complicated the West’s moves to isolate Russia and
   exclude it from the global economy. Conversely, if it so choses,
   Beijing could play a constructive role in mediating between the parties
   to end this war. But so far China’s vague “peace plan” has achieved
   nothing concrete, and it continues to emphasize the importance of its
   partnership with Russia.

   Since the invasion, China has consistently blamed NATO and the West for
   provoking Russia into launching the attack and not taking Russia’s
   legitimate security interests into account, repeating verbatim Russian
   talking points. It has refrained from calling the conflict a war or
   saying that Russia invaded its neighbor. Russian President Vladmir
   Putin may very well not have told Chinese President Xi Jinping in
   advance in February 2022 that this would be a full-scale invasion, as
   opposed to a limited-sounding “Special Military Operation.” But once it
   started, China may have presumed, like many in the West, that the war
   would be over in a few days.

   By now, the Chinese must be taken aback by the below-par performance of
   the Russian military and the brutality of the war, and they may well
   have lost some confidence in Putin’s judgment. But they cannot afford
   to have Russia lose, given the deepening tensions of great power
   competition. While China was silent during the 24-hour mutiny by Evgeny
   Prigozhin’s Wagner group back in June, it must question the dynamics of
   Kremlin politics and wonder how stable the situation really is.

A Key Partner

   Russia remains a key partner for China in its determination to create a
   multipolar world order in which the United States and Europe no longer
   set the agenda or the rules. Russia’s vision of a post-West order is
   different from China’s. President Putin’s Russia promotes a disruptive
   and anarchic world order with no rules. But the nightmare scenario for
   China would be a post-Putin Russia led by a leader who would reassess
   Russia’s interests and decide that it was important to repair relations
   with the West and distance Moscow from Beijing. China’s determination
   to prevent Russia from losing the war and experiencing unpredictable
   regime change is a constant challenge for the US and its allies who are
   supporting Ukraine. It adds to the weight of the other issues that are
   straining the West’s relationship with China.

   Despite the initial “no limits” label, there are indeed limits to this
   partnership. When Xi visited Moscow in March 2023 he praised the
   Russian-Chinese strategic partnership. But he did not meet Russia’s
   twin goals of signing an agreement to build the Power of Siberia II gas
   pipeline or supply lethal weapons to Russia. So far, Beijing has been
   careful not to violate Western sanctions against Russia for fear that
   it would trigger secondary sanctions on China.

   During the summit, Russia commended China’s “objective and unbiased
   position” on Ukraine, including the peace proposal Beijing made in
   February. A separate statement detailed plans to expand bilateral
   investment and trade, including in national currencies, to develop new
   bilateral logistics channels, to expand energy cooperation, and to
   ensure both countries’ supply of “basic goods and mineral resources.”

   Indeed, China’s exports to Russia grew by 67.2 percent in the first
   half of 2023. One reason that China has moved to the fore as the
   world’s leading auto exporter is because it has filled the void left by
   the withdrawal of Western automakers from Russia. Chinese trade with
   Russia has steadily increased since the war began, although it remains
   much more important for Russia than for China. Indeed, Russia is
   becoming a Chinese economic dependency, having lost its natural gas and
   other markets in Europe that were so important for Putin’s rise to
   power.

   The two countries have also stepped up their military cooperation in
   the past 15 months. China, Russia, and Iran launched joint military
   exercises in March in the Gulf of Oman in the latest sign of Beijing's
   efforts to expand its influence in the Middle East. In June, the
   Chinese and Russian militaries had their sixth joint air strategic
   patrol in the airspace of the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea.
   Chinese and Russian aircraft entered the southern and eastern parts of
   the South Korean air defense identification zone. South Korea scrambled
   fighter jets after four Russian and four Chinese military aircraft
   entered its air defense zone. Japan responded in a similar way after
   two Russian and two Chinese bombers flew over the Sea of Japan to the
   East China Sea, where two other Chinese fighter planes joined. The
   joint exercises in the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea are seen as
   particularly provocative by the West’s Asian allies. China and Russia
   have also held joint naval exercises with South Africa.

Promoting the BRICS

   Since the war began, China and Russia have also redoubled the promotion
   of the multilateral organizations they lead that exclude the West—BRICS
   and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). They see these
   groupings as important building blocks for their vision of a post-West
   multilateral global order. Indeed, six countries—Argentina, Egypt,
   Ethiopia, Iran, Saudia Arabia, and the Unitd Arab Emirates—will join
   BRICS in 2024, as announced last week at this year’s BRICS summit in
   Johannisburg (which took place without Putin in attendance); 19 had
   applied for membership. Some of these future members and applicants
   have close ties to the United States, and it is unclear how joining
   BRICS would impact these ties.

   China and Russia have also emerged as champions of the Global South.
   Russia has reiterated the claim that it is an “anti-imperialist” power
   and that the United States and Europe are the imperialists. Somehow,
   the Soviet Union’s colonial role in Eastern Europe and over non-Russian
   ethnic groups is overlooked. The majority of Global South countries do
   not view Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as part of the Kremlin’s
   imperialist project and many still view Russia as the successor to the
   USSR, which supported anti-colonial movements in the Third World. They
   believe that Russia has done nothing worse than what the United States
   has done over the past half century (Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan), and
   have refused to condemn or sanction Russia. India, a partner of the
   United States in the Quad (with Japan and Australia), has made it
   abundantly clear that Russia remains an important economic and
   strategic partner, even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has warned
   Putin against making nuclear threats. India’s foreign Minister
   Subrahmanyan Jainshankar has called Russia “a time-tested and steady
   partner.”

European Leverage

   All these developments have made it much more difficult for the West to
   maintain sanctions on Russia. Yet Europe does have some leverage.
   Chinese-American relations deteriorated under the Trump and Biden
   administrations and show few signs of improving. Indeed, the US has
   designated China as the number one threat to its security. It has also
   leaned on its European allies to distance themselves more from China,
   one of their principle economic partners.

   China is still hoping to persuade the Europeans not to take a similar
   path of restrictions and decoupling to that of the United States. Hence
   the “peace plan,” and the belief in some European capitals that these
   Chinese attempts should be encouraged. Of course, the question that no
   outsider can answer is how much clout Xi has with Putin to persuade him
   to change course in Ukraine and agree to come to serious negotiations,
   rather than to continue to bank on the kind of propaganda that Russia
   launched just before the war, declaring it was all the West’s and
   Kyiv’s fault.

Address Beijing, Not Moscow

   The West has some options in trying to counter the impact of the
   deepening Chinese-Russian relationship on the war in Ukraine. The
   addressee must be China, not Russia, for as long as the war continues.
   First, China should be reminded that supplying lethal weapons to Russia
   will lead to secondary sanctions for China. It should also be made
   clear—as it already has been to the Kremlin—that any use of nuclear
   weapons by Russia will elicit a swift, robust response from NATO. Xi
   reportedly warned Putin in person that the use of nuclear weapons was
   inadmissible, although it is unclear what China would do if Russia were
   to detonate a tactical nuclear weapon.

   A more challenging task is to engage China, even as Washington’s
   relationship with Beijing is  brittle. Secretary of State Antony
   Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have recently visited
   Beijing seeking to resume a dialogue after the spy balloon incident and
   a long drought of contact. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French
   President Emmanuel Macron have also visited. While it may be difficult
   to persuade China to distance itself from Russia, the West should
   refrain from taking actions that push them closer together. Europe is
   already engaged in a vigorous debate about how to deal with China—as
   Germany’s first China strategy paper shows—and, as long as China
   believes that it can continue to pursue profitable and productive ties
   with Europe it may have incentives to continue to play a mediating role
   between Russia, Ukraine, and Europe.

   There is one area where the US and Europe should be doing more, and
   that is sustained outreach to the Global South. Often these countries’
   neutrality or tacit support for Russia is a product of long-standing
   ideological antipathy to the United States. Moreover, some countries
   understand that, as a result of this war, with shifting coalitions
   emerging, they may have more say in the global order going forward.

   While not countering that view, the West should make a better case for
   why a war far away in Europe does affect their future. If Russia can
   get away with invading and annexing a neighbor’s territory, what does
   that mean for their future sovereignty and territorial integrity? It is
   better to emphasize Russia’s violation of international law than to
   cast the conflict in terms of democracy versus autocracy. China has
   reiterated its commitment to the UN Charter and to states’ territorial
   integrity and sovereignty. Emphasizing that Russia disregards all of
   these is a first step to engaging the Global South in a more productive
   conversation about the war.

   the West and with the Rest was published earlier this year.

          Ukraine expands control on Dnipro's left bank

   Germany will supply Ukraine with 20,000 more
   strategically-important 155mm artillery shells as part of a new £1.1
   billion military aid package.

   Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said the package would also include
   four additional IRIS-T air defence units and anti-tank mines.

   The artillery shells come on top of 140,000 155mm rounds Germany has
   already pledged to deliver next year.

   Volodymyr Zelensky said last week that artillery shell deliveries had
   “really slowed down” since the Israel-Hamas war began, with the
   European Union admitting earlier this month that it would fail to meet
   its pledge to supply one million shells by March next year.

   “This underlines that we stand with Ukraine sustainably and reliably,”
   Mr Pistorius said during an unannounced visit to Kyiv on Tuesday.

   The aid will supplement an £880,000 “winter package” announced by
   Berlin last month.

   Germany is the second-largest donor of military aid to Ukraine behind
   the United States and plans to double its commitment next year to
   £6.8bn.

We'll lose 'war of exhaustion', Ukrainian soldiers complain

   Ukrainian soldiers fear they will lose a “war of exhaustion” with
   Russia as their frontline units deplete in strength.

   Units fighting at the front are between 20 and 40 per cent below
   strength and “those remaining are tired,” retired Ukrainian lieutenant
   general Ihor Romanenko told the Wall Street Journal.

   “We don’t have a chance playing war of exhaustion with Russia,” said
   Private Bohdan Lysenko of the 47th Brigade, whose unit is defending
   Avdiivka with just 20 men, down from a peak in the summer of 120.

   “They’re not stupid. It’s a strategy… We don’t have enough ammunition,
   but they [the Russians] have enough people,” added Corporal Mykhailo
   Kotsyurba, who is in the same company as Pvt Lysenko.

   Britain and the US both estimate that Russia has lost more than 300,000
   killed and wounded soldiers during the war so far.

   “They treat us as waste material,” said Andrei Bednyaev, a Russian
   infantryman being held captive by the Ukrainians.

   The frontline has become increasingly stationary in recent months amid
   growing fears that the West cannot provide enough funding and arms for
   Ukraine to break through.
   2:22PM

Ukraine denies plan to sack two more generals

   Ukraine’s defence minister has insisted a rumoured decision to sack two
   more generals has “not yet been made”.

   “I must say that the decision has not yet been made, but we are doing
   everything possible to improve efficiency,” Rustem Umerov told
   reporters.

   Media reports emerged last week that Ukraine would sack Lt Gen Serhii
   Naiev, who is joint forces commander, Maj Gen Tetiana Ostashchenko,
   commander of the medical forces, and Brig Gen Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, who
   leads the southern Tavria command.

   The reports were denied but Maj Gen Ostashchenko was then sacked on
   Sunday night, sparking speculation that Lt Gen Naiev and Brig Gen
   Tarnavskyi would follow.
   2:04PM

Analysis: Ukraine turns to the EU for support amid Israel-Hamas war

   Charles Michel, one of the EU’s most a senior officials, arrived in
   Kyiv on Tuesday at a time when the Ukrainians are looking for Europe
   for support more than ever before, reports Joe Barnes, our Brussels
   Correspondent.

   Funding from the United States is starting to dwindle and the route
   into Nato is closed as long as fighting continues.

   This leaves Ukraine with limited avenues to find large international
   organisations willing to support it with new funds and not just
   rhetoric. The EU is seen as perhaps the last viable option on the
   table.

   And with war waging between Israel and Hamas, Washington has
   increasingly pressured Brussels to take up the mantle of supporting
   Ukraine.

   The pledges made by European governments – including by Germany, which
   has announced a doubling of military support – are starting to reflect
   this shift.

   Mr Michel, the European Council’s president, will play a key role in
   this assistance when he chairs talks in December over whether Ukraine
   can start accession negotiations with the EU and receive a €20billion
   military aid package.

   Neither of those are certainties.

   “When I say this will be a difficult European summit, this is a fact”,
   Mr Michel said. “I will spare no effort to have a positive decision in
   December, but can’t predict what happens – not everything is black and
   white.”
   1:56PM

Germany announces new $1.4billion in aid for Ukraine

   Germany has announced a new $1.4billion (£1.1billion) aid package for
   Ukraine.

   Defence minister Boris Pistorius is visiting Kyiv today and said the
   deal will include four new IRIS-T air-to-air missile units.

   “I am sure this will help you in your fight against the Russian
   aggression,” he said. “This underlines that we stand with Ukraine
   sustainably and reliably.”

   The deal also includes anti-tank mines and an additional 20,000
   artillery shells.

   Germany is the second-largest donor of military aid to Ukraine, behind
   the United States.

Ukraine MP offered official $50k crypto bribe

   A Ukrainian MP who sits on an anti-corruption committee in parliament
   has been accused of offering a $50,000 (£40,000) cryptocurrency bribe
   to a state official, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) has
   said.

   NABU did not name the MP and it is not clear whether he has been
   arrested or charged.

   He is said to have made the offer to the head of the State Agency for
   Reconstruction and Infrastructure Development, who informed anti-graft
   investigators.

   The agency said it had “zero tolerance for corruption”.

   The MP is reported to have wanted assistance in obtaining state funds
   for infrastructure repairs in exchange for the bribe.

Ukraine's secret service detains priest for 'pro-Russian sermons'

   Ukraine’s secret service has detained a priest for including
   pro-Russian propaganda in his sermons and criticising the Ukrainian
   army.

   The clergyman, in the Russia-linked Ukrainian Orthodox Church, is also
   said to have praised Russian-backed warlords in Donetsk on his Telegram
   channel.

   The priest served in the western city of Vinnytsia but was in hiding
   when he was detained, the SBU said.

   Ukraine has two main Orthodox churches, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church
   (Moscow Patriarchate) and the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (Kyiv
   Patriarchate).

   It has accused the former of aligning with Russia during the war, which
   the church denies.

US to send more Himars to Ukraine in new $100m package

   The US is sending more Himars rockets to Ukraine as part of a new
   $100million (£80million) aid package, defence secretary Lloyd Austin
   announced on a surprise visit to Kyiv.

   It will also send Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, Javelin anti-tank
   rockets and more than three million rounds of small arms ammunition.

   The deal was agreed as Mr Austin visited Kyiv to “reaffirm the United
   States’ steadfast support for Ukraine”.

   There has been months of increasing political division over support for
   Ukraine in the US, where Congress has refused to vote through an
   additional $60billion (£48.8billion) in funding requested by President
   Joe Biden.

   National security adviser Jake Sullivan said earlier this month that
   Washington’s ability to support Kyiv is getting “harder and harder”
   with “each week that passes”.

Russia and India hold joint naval drills

   Russia and India are holding joint naval exercises in the Bay of
   Bengal, Moscow’s defence ministry has said.

   “The purpose of the exercise is to comprehensively develop and
   strengthen naval co-operation between Russia and India,” it said.

   The exercises will last until Wednesday and involve ships from Russia’s
   Pacific fleet.

   Russia is trying to boost its presence in the region and last week held
   drills with Myanmar.

   India has not sanctioned Russia over the war in Ukraine and the US has
   previously voiced concerns about the possibility of joint naval drills.

Ukraine's dream to join EU now a 'reality', says Zelensky

   Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ukraine’s once “romantic dream” of joining
   the European Union is now a “reality”.

   “Therefore, our candidate status and further accession negotiations
   should certainly result in Ukraine’s full membership in the EU,” he
   said in a video address to mark the 10th anniversary of the start of
   the Maidan protests.

   “And we are doing all this despite the war, when our people are
   defending themselves and Europe right now.”

   10:21AM

Maidan a 'foreign coup', says Kremlin

   The Kremlin has condemned the 2014 Maidan revolution as a “foreign
   coup” as Ukraine celebrates the 10th anniversary of the start of
   pro-European Union protests.

   “The fact that it was sponsored from abroad has been acknowledged,
   directly and indirectly, by representatives of foreign countries,”
   Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.

   “That is no secret to anyone.”

   9:50AM

Moldova and Ukraine set for EU talks in Kyiv

   European Council president Charles Michel and Moldovan president Maia
   Sandu have both arrived in Kyiv this morning to discuss Ukraine and
   Moldova’s accession to the European Union.

   Ms Sandu said: “On our agenda: discussing next steps in EU accession of
   Moldova and Ukraine, enhancing regional security, and EU’s continued
   support of reforms and development in our countries.”

   “Good to be back in Kyiv – among friends,” added Mr Michel on X,
   formerly Twitter.

   9:42AM

Russia cannot co-exist with Zelensky's Ukraine, says diplomat

   Russia cannot co-exist with Volodymyr Zelensky’s Ukraine, a diplomat
   has said.

   “The current regime is absolutely toxic, we do not see any options for
   co-existence with it at the moment,” Rodion Miroshnik, Russia’s
   ambassador-at-large, told reporters in Moscow.

   He accused Ukraine of war crimes against civilians and said the West
   would eventually lose interest in the war.

   “We can resist Nato just as much as we need to fulfill the tasks that
   the president has formulated,” he added.

   9:35AM

MoD: Russia stockpiling cruise missiles for winter bombardment

   Russia has not used its “premier” cruise missiles for two months as it
   builds a stockpile for a winter bombardment of Ukrainian
   infrastructure, the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said.

   “Russia is highly likely to use these missiles if it repeats last
   year’s effort to destroy Ukraine’s critical national infrastructure,”
   it said in its latest defence intelligence update.

   The MoD added that Russia has been instead using Iranian-designed
   Shahed kamikaze drones to “degrade Ukraine’s air defences” before “any
   concerted winter campaign of strikes against Ukraine’s energy
   infrastructure”.

Russia may seek compensation for Nord Stream

   Russia may seek compensation for the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas
   pipelines but will first wait for an investigation to conclude.

   The pipelines under the Baltic Sea were damaged in explosions in
   September 2022 but no culprit has been identified yet.

   “The probe is not over yet, we are waiting for its results to be
   presented to the (United Nations) Security Council, then we will decide
   what to do,” Dmitry Birichevsky, a foreign ministry official, replied
   to a question on compensation asked by the Russian state news agency
   RIA.

   Sweden, Denmark and Germany are leading the investigation. Russia has
   blamed the US, Britain and Ukraine, which the three countries have
   denied.

We've fought off Ukraine's Dnipro crossing attempts, claims Russia

   Russian soldiers have fought off attempts by Ukraine to establish new
   footholds on the left bank of the Dnipro, its defence ministry has
   claimed.

   Contradicting open source analysis and Russian bloggers, the ministry
   said marines, aviation and artillery were “stopping all attempts by the
   armed forces of Ukraine to carry out amphibious landings on the Dnipro
   islands and the left bank of the Dnipro river.”

   It added that Ukrainian forces were suffering heavy casualties and
   losing equipment in these attempts.

   The defence ministry also published a video which it said showed
   marines defeating Ukrainian soldiers. Soldiers can be seen firing a
   variety of weapons in the footage but the outcome of the fighting shown
   is not clear.

   8:32AM

Russian strikes overnight kill three and injure eight

   Russian strikes have killed two civilians and injured six in the
   eastern Donetsk and Kharkiv regions.

   A hospital and a coal mine in Selydove, a town in Donetsk, were struck
   by missiles, injuring eight, killing two and temporarily trapping 39
   miners underground.

   Another Ukrainian was killed by shelling in Kharkiv, its governor Oleh
   Synehubov said.

   8:18AM

Zelensky hails Maidan protestors as 'first counter-offensive'

   Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the 2014 Maidan protestors as Ukraine’s
   “first counter-offensive” on the 10th anniversary of the pro-European
   Union protests.

   “10 years ago, we began a new chapter in our struggle,” he said.

   “10 years ago, Ukrainians launched their first counteroffensive.
   Against lawlessness and an attempt to rob us of our European future.
   Against unfreedom.
   ”Year after year, step by step, we make every effort to ensure that,
   among the other stars on the EU flag, which represents the unity of
   European nations, our star shines as well. The Ukrainian star.”

     10 years ago, we began a new chapter in our struggle. 10 years ago,

Ukraine expands control on Dnipro's left bank

   Ukraine has expanded its control of the Dnipro river’s left bank, the
   Institute for the Study of War think tank has said.

   It cited reports by Russian bloggers that Ukrainian soldiers have
   advanced to the west of Krynky, where fighting continues.

   Commandos first crossed the river in October and Ukraine has since
   consolidated its bridgehead, pushing Russian forces back by as many as
   five miles.

   Securing the strategic advance would raise the prospect of further
   southward advances towards Crimea.

ISW: Russia using migrants to destabilise Nato on Finnish border

   Russia is using migrants to destabilise Nato on Finland’s border, the
   Institute for the Study of War think tank has said.

   Finland has closed four border crossings with Russia and has is
   considering shutting the remaining four after an influx of African and
   Middle Eastern migrants it says is being directed by Moscow.

   The ISW said Russia is doing so as part of a “hybrid warfare tactic”
   and is likely planning to portray Finland’s response to the migrant
   crisis as Nato aggression.

   “ISW has also consistently assessed that one of Putin’s goals in
   launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was to break up
   Nato – a goal he continues to pursue,” it said.

   The think tank added that it was similar to the migrant crisis which
   Russia and Belarus created on Poland’s border in 2021 by funneling
   migrants towards it.

   7:33AM

US sanctions Russian officers for Bucha and Andriivka war crimes

   The US has sanctioned two Russian officers who killed civilians in
   Bucha and Andriivka at the beginning of the war in Ukraine.

   Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov, who is known as the butcher of Bucha, was
   the commanding officer of a Russian brigade that occupied Andriivka and
   Bucha, north of Kyiv, in early 2022.

   He killed, beat, dismembered, burned and conducted mock executions of
   civilians in Bucha, the US state department said. He was awarded
   Russia’s highest honour by Vladimir Putin in July 2022.

   Corporal Daniil Frolkin, a member of Col Omurbekov’s brigade, confessed
   to journalists in August 2022 that he killed a civilian in Andriivka in
   March 2022. He was given a suspended five-and-a-half year sentence by a
   Russian military court for spreading “false information” about the army
   in March this year.

   Russian forces killed hundreds of civilians in Bucha and Andriivka.

   The American sanctions bar Col Omurbekov, Cpl Frolkin and their
   immediate families from entering the country.

   7:21AM

German defence minister visits Kyiv

   German defence minister Boris Pistorius has made a surprise visit to
   Kyiv.

   He visited a memorial to the 2014 Euromaidan revolution on the 10th
   anniversary of the day it started, laying flowers in commemoration of
   those who died.

   “I am here again, firstly to pledge further support, but also to
   express our solidarity and deep bond and also our admiration for the
   courageous, brave and costly fight that is being waged here,” he said.

   Mr Pistorius is set to meet Volodomyr Zelensky and defence minister
   Rustem Umerov.

   Germany is the world’s second-largest provider of military aid to
   Ukraine after the US.

   effect following weeks of Israeli bombardment. A four-day truce in the

   The four-day ceasefire and hostage agreement tentatively reached
   between Israel and Hamas is a breakthrough following weeks of
   negotiations brokered by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States. Despite
   this, analysts highly doubt this brief truce will lead to a
   long-lasting ceasefire or any significant cessation of hostilities in a
   war nearing its fiftieth day.

   Reached on Wednesday, the agreement aims to facilitate Hamas’ release
   of 50 hostages, civilian women and children, currently held in the Gaza
   Strip, and Israel releasing approximately three times as many
   Palestinian women and children in its prisons.

   Israel has further clarified that it will extend the ceasefire for each
   day Hamas agrees to release an additional 10 hostages it is holding.
   Hamas kidnapped as many as 240 Israeli and foreign civilians from
   Southern Israel during its unprecedented Oct. 7 attack that sparked
   this present war, the deadliest Gaza has ever seen.

   The ceasefire took effect on Friday, with Hamas releasing 24 people and
   Israel freeing 39 Palestinian prisoners.

   President Biden has said “the chances are real” that this pause could
   lead to a longer ceasefire, noting that it’s “only a start, but so far
   it’s gone well.”

   Ryan Bohl, a senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at the risk
   intelligence company RANE, dubbed the truce the “first significant
   diplomatic breakthrough” in this war so far, noting that it means
   humanitarian conditions in Gaza will be “allowed to improved” for at
   least a few days.

   The ceasefire comes amidst a war that has displaced two-thirds of
   Gaza’s 2.2 million population, who have limited access to food and
   water. An estimated 200,000 Israelis living in border communities with
   Gaza and Lebanon in the north have also faced displacement since Oct.
   7.

   “In terms of what’s next, what we needed to see is a diplomatic process
   that in some form or another will address Israel’s security concerns,
   which are driven by Hamas’s control of the Gaza Strip,” Bohl told me.

   “If this diplomatic process can somehow end Hamas’s control of Gaza,
   then it would preclude the need for further Israeli military operations
   and potentially prevent a full-scale reoccupation of Gaza by the
   Israeli military,” he said.

   However, Bohl underlined that this is “a very difficult scenario” since
   it would require Hamas to “accept a secondary or perhaps even
   non-existent formal role in Gaza” and perhaps even necessitate Israel
   accepting that it might not get all the perpetrators of the Oct. 7
   attack.

   Independent Middle East analyst Kyle Orton believes there is “little
   chance” this ceasefire will lead to “a broader cessation of
   hostilities.”

   “Israel is willing to try anything to get the hostages back, but the
   determination to destroy Hamas remains: after Oct. 7, there is an
   overwhelming consensus within Israel that there can be no security
   while Hamas rules Gaza,” Orton told me.

   Israel’s campaign began shortly after the Hamas attack 49 days ago. So
   far, it has lasted almost as long as the longest Israeli operation
   against Hamas to date, Operation Protective Edge in mid-2014, which
   lasted 51 days but has proven far more deadly for Gaza and its
   inhabitants.

   While an estimated 2,310 Palestinians lost their lives in that 2014
   operation, an estimated 14,100 have been killed in the present
   conflict, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It’s presently unclear
   how many of these are Hamas or other militants. The Hamas attack on
   Israel that precipitated this war was also the deadliest in Israel's
   modern history, killing at least 1,200 Israelis, the overwhelming
   majority of whom were civilians.

   “It is possible that we see humanitarian pauses and or a more
   restrained Israeli military campaign going forward to ease humanitarian
   concerns from the United States,” Bohl said. “But broadly, we are
   likely to see a resumption of Israeli military operations in the coming
   days or weeks in order to finish up the ground invasion.”

   “This is in large part because there are no readily viable options that
   address Israel’s security concerns short of this,” he added.

   Both Israel and Hamas made concessions to reach this agreement. Israel
   had previously maintained it wanted all the hostages released, while
   Hamas was insisting it would only trade the hostages for the estimated
   6,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons.

   The two sides have also declared their readiness to resume fighting.

   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the trade a
   “difficult” but “right decision,” vowing that no hostage deal would end
   the fighting. He affirmed Israel will fight on until it meets its
   stated objectives of “eradicating Hamas, bringing all hostages back,
   and ensuring that in the day after Hamas, Gaza won’t threaten Israel.”

   For its part, Hamas declared that “our fingers remain on the trigger”
   and its “victorious fighters will remain on the lookout to defend our
   people and defeat the occupation.”

   Nicholas Heras, senior director of strategy and innovation at the New
   Lines Institute, described the ceasefire deal as “an inflection point”
   in the conflict.

   “The Netanyahu-led government insists that it will not have the IDF
   (Israel Defense Forces) leave Gaza until Hamas is removed from power,
   but there is enormous pressure from Biden on Netanyahu behind the
   scenes to end the conflict as soon as possible,” Heras told me.

   “For these reasons, the ceasefire deal, which is extendable by design,
   could be the start of the runway for Netanyahu to end the war,” he
   said.

   Netanyahu has previously refused even to contemplate a ceasefire until
   all the hostages were released. However, he has faced mounting pressure
   at home from the hostage families, who recently staged a large march to
   Jerusalem to pressure his government on the matter.

   Orton noted that Netanyahu had no choice but to try any means to get
   the hostages home, given the strong demand among the Israeli public.
   Nevertheless, he believes the Israeli prime minister is “on a hiding to
   nothing” regarding the outcome.

   “If some of the hostages are recovered, this will be seen as no more
   than what he should be doing to correct a mistake of his own making
   since many in Israel blame him for not adequately preparing to prevent
   the Oct. 7 pogrom,” he said.

   On the other hand, if it all goes wrong, that will be added to the
   extensive “political indictment” against Netanyahu.

   “If Netanyahu was going to be replaced before the war was over, that
   would probably have already happened,” Orton said. “But if this leads
   to some kind of disaster or if Netanyahu seems to be getting drawn into
   an open-ended ceasefire, the chances of a move against him from within
   the Cabinet increase.”

   Heras doubts the Israeli military leadership will want to cease
   targeted operations and strikes against the Hamas leadership and also
   wants to guarantee Hamas will not run Gaza after this war eventually
   comes to a formal end.

   “This reality, combined with the fact that the top echelon of Hamas
   military leaders in Gaza are still alive and will want to claim victory
   over Israel by surviving beyond the war, means that the situation is on
   the knife’s edge of returning to a full-blown war,” he said.

   NEW YORK (AP) — Oscar-winning actor Susan Sarandon and “Scream” star
   Melissa Barrera were each dropped by Hollywood companies after making
   comments on the Israel-Hamas war that some deemed antisemitic.

   Spyglass Media Group, the production company behind the upcoming
   “Scream VII,” acknowledged Barrera’s exit from the horror franchise.
   The Mexican-born actress, who starred in “In the Heights” and the two
   recent “Scream” installments, had posted statements on Instagram
   Stories calling the war “genocide and ethnic cleansing.”

   “Gaza,” she wrote, “is currently being treated like a concentration
   camp.”

   Spyglass said in a statement that its position “is unequivocally clear:
   We have zero tolerance for antisemitism or the incitement of hate in
   any form, including false references to genocide, ethnic cleansing,
   Holocaust distortion or anything that flagrantly crosses the line into
   hate speech.”

   Late Wednesday, Barrera posted a statement on Instagram Stories about
   her firing.

   “First and foremost I condemn antisemitism and Islamophobia. I condemn
   hate and prejudice of any kind against any group of people,” she wrote.

   “I believe a group of people are NOT their leadership, and that no
   governing body should be above criticism,” she added. “I pray day and
   night for no more deaths, for no more violence, and for peaceful
   co-existence. I will continue to speak out for those that need it most
   and continue to advocate for peace and safety, for human rights and
   freedom.”

   Earlier Wednesday, Deadline reported that Jenna Ortega, who played
   Barrera’s sister in the two previous “Scream” films, has exited the
   seventh installment. Ortega earlier departed the franchise because of
   her “Wednesday” schedule, the trade reported. A spokesperson for Ortega
   didn’t immediately respond to queries.

   A spokesman for the United Talent Agency said Sarandon, the five-time
   Oscar nominee, is no longer represented by the agency. Sarandon’s exit
   from UTA followed comments she’s made about Israel, most recently in an
   appearance Nov. 17 at a pro-Palestinian rally in New York.

   “There are a lot of people afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are
   getting a taste of what it feels like to be a Muslim in this country,
   so often subjected to violence,” Sarandon said, according to the New
   York Post.

   The Post reported that Sarandon joined the crowd in chanting “From the
   river to the sea, Palestine will be free” — a slogan some see as
   antisemitic because it suggests the eradication of Israel.

   Sarandon could not be reached for comment Wednesday. At the rally, she
   also was quoted as saying: “There’s a terrible thing that’s happened
   where antisemitism has been confused with speaking up against Israel. I
   am against antisemitism. I am against Islamophobia.”

   The Israel-Hamas war has caused rifts throughout Hollywood. Earlier,
   when many groups were issuing statements condemning Hamas’ Oct. 7
   attack on Israel, the Writers Guild of America ultimately didn’t after
   failing to come to an agreement. Maha Dakhil, a prominent agent with
   Creative Arts Agency, last month resigned her board seat after sharing
   a social media post accusing Israel of genocide. Dakhil apologized.

   Israel and Hamas on Wednesday agreed to a four-day cease-fire in the
   war in Gaza.

   Israel's Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi submitted a proposal to
   take action against Haaretz by ending the publication of government
   notices in Haaretz. Karhi, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin
   Netanyahu's Likud party, said the newspaper was "sabotaging Israel in
   wartime" and was an "inflammatory mouthpiece for Israel’s enemies."

   The proposal, which was submitted without being vetted by the
   ministry's legal adviser, would immediately halt any payments to
   Haaretz from any state entity within his purview.

   Haaretz publisher Amos Schocken responded to Karhi’s proposal by
   saying, “If the government wants to close Haaretz, that’s the time to
   read Haaretz.”

   Karhi's proposal, which would forbid the publication of official
   government notices in Haaretz, and would cancel all state employee
   Haaretz subscriptions – including those held by members of the IDF, the
   police, the prison service, government ministries and government
   companies – was sent to Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs.

   In a letter to Fuchs entitled, “Taking action against the Haaretz
   newspaper for the dissemination of lying, defeatist propaganda,” Karhi
   wrote: “Since the beginning of the war, I have received many complaints
   that Haaretz has taken an offensive line which undermines the war's
   goals and disparages the military effort and its social fortitude. It
   is possible that some of the paper's publications even cross the
   criminal standard set in those far-flung sections of the penal code
   reserved for wartime only.”

   Karhi added: “The State of Israel is one of Haaretz’s customers, and
   the government has the power to decide that it isn’t interested in
   being a customer of a newspaper that is sabotaging Israel in wartime
   and undermining the spirit of Israeli soldiers and civilians in the
   face of the enemy.” He noted he was still waiting for his ministry's
   legal adviser to offer an opinion regarding his proposal, “and I don’t
   know what it will be.”

   The Israeli journalists’ union said in a statement that “the
   communications minister has lost his way. Karhi, who spent most of his
   brief tenure in failed attempts to close the public broadcasting
   corporation, has decided to tame a new target. His new proposal to end
   all government business with Haaretz is a populistic proposal devoid of
   any feasibility or logic, and its entire purpose is to garner likes
   among his political base at the expense of dedicated journalists who
   are working night and day right now to cover the war."

   “We support Haaretz’s journalists, and we’re certain they will continue
   to do important work for the benefit of Israel and won’t be deterred by
   Minister Karhi’s stupid, empty threats,” it added.

   In his letter, Karhi cited the recently approved emergency regulations
   that allow the government to take action against foreign media outlets
   that harm the country.

   “It’s inconceivable that at a time when we are taking action against
   foreign stations, an Israeli newspaper should continue to get a
   significant share of its funding from the Israeli public while it
   serves as an inflammatory mouthpiece for Israel’s enemies,” he wrote.

   The security cabinet recently authorized Karhi to take action under
   these regulations against Al Mayadeen, a Lebanese television station
   affiliated with Hezbollah that also reports from Israel, on the grounds
   that it harms national security and serves a terrorist organization.
   Karhi subsequently signed an order blocking the station’s internet
   channel in Israel and asked the army to issue a closure order for its
   offices in the West Bank.

   However, the cabinet refused to approve his request to close the Qatari
   station Al Jazeera, in part because of Qatar’s involvement in
   negotiations for the release of the hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza
   Strip.

   Prominent journalists from around the world have denounced Karhi's
   threats. CNN's Jake Tapper tweeted: "A push to undermine the free press
   from the Netanyahu government." The Nation's Jeet Heer wrote: "Haaretz
   is a great newspaper, needed now more than ever." Yashar Ali, who
   writes for the Huffington Post and the New York Magazine, wrote in
   response: "I just subscribed."

Where things stand
       Hostage deal: A hotly anticipated hostage deal between Hamas and
       Israel - which includes a four-day pause to fighting - has been
       left up in the air. Hamas had announced there'd be a four-day pause
       beginning at 10am on Thursday - but an Israeli source has since
       told the BBC there's been a setback.
       It came after a security adviser to the Israeli government said
       there'd be no Israeli hostages released by Hamas before Friday.
       Criticism of pause time: Families of those being held in Gaza have
       said every captive "needs to come home", but the UN's Palestinian
       refugee agency Unrwa said a four-day pause - in which more aid
       would be allowed to go into the enclave - is simply not enough.
       Aid crisis: Lorries carrying aid are now queuing up at the Rafah
       crossing from Egypt into Gaza in anticipation of the pause in
       hostilities. Earlier, the executive director of Unicef - the UN's
       agency for children - said Gaza now faces a crisis of "child
       wasting" - a term used to describe the most life-threatening form
       of malnutrition.
       Fighting continues: On the ground, Israel has continued its ground
       and air operation in Gaza - and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
       has vowed to win "absolute victory" over Hamas. Meanwhile, Israeli
       defence minister Yoav Gallant said Israel is "slowly but surely"
       dismantling the military framework of Hamas.
       What happens now? Our colleagues on the ground are continuing to
       gather information about the hostage deal and what its potential
       delay means.

Hezbollah says son of senior lawmaker killed in Israeli strike
       Five members of Hezbollah - the powerful Iranian-backed militia in
       Lebanon - have been killed in an Israeli strike in Beit Yahoun,
       south Lebanon, according to the Shia Islamist group.
       Abbas Raad, son of senior Hezbollah figure and Lebanese lawmaker
       Mohammad Raad was one of them, the group says.
       According to Reuters news agency, a total of 85 Hezbollah fighters
       have now been killed since violence broke out along the
       Israel-Lebanon border.
       Israel's army said it struck several Hezbollah targets in Lebanon
       on Wednesday evening, including "terror infrastructure" and "terror
       cells" that tried to launch rockets into Israel and fired at
       Israeli troops.
       Hezbollah is the largest political and military force in Lebanon.
       It is classed as a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and the
       Arab League.

More than 50 from same family killed in Gaza, says Palestinian Authority
       As we've been reporting, the agreed pause in fighting is yet to
       begin - and Palestinian news agency Wafa has reported dozens of
       people killed in Israeli attacks on Wednesday.
       The foreign minister of the Palestinian Authority (PA), Riyad
       al-Maliki, has said 52 of those killed in the Jabalia refugee camp
       in northern Gaza on Wednesday morning belonged to the same family.
       "Only this morning, from the Qadoura family in Jabalia, 52 people
       have been wiped out completely, killed," he said during a trip to
       London.
       "I have the list of the names, 52 of them, they were wiped out
       completely from grandfather to grandchildren."
       The BBC has not been able to verify this independently. As a
       reminder, the PA is based in the occupied West Bank and is entirely
       separate to Hamas.

Who are the hostages taken by Hamas?
       Ditza Heiman
       Ditza Heiman familyCopyright: Ditza Heiman family
       The BBC has been tracking reports and stories of the people taken
       hostage by Hamas.
       It says it has hidden the hostages in "safe places and tunnels"
       within Gaza. Israel Defense Forces have previously said the
       hostages include children, and between 10 and 20 over-60s.
       One of those was Ditza Heiman, 84.
       She was seen by a neighbour at kibbutz Nir Oz being led away by
       Hamas gunmen, her niece said.
       A former social worker, she is the widow of Zvi Shdaimah, who came
       to the UK on the Kindertransport, the organised rescue of children
       from Nazi-controlled areas during World War Two.

Israeli government says it believes releasing Palestinians right move to get
hostages home
       Eylon Levy
       BBCCopyright: BBC
       A little earlier and before we got the news that the release of
       some hostages and pause in fighting will not take place before
       Friday, a spokesperson for the Israeli government spoke to our
       colleagues on the BBC News channel.
       Asked what he made of the hostage deal that's been agreed between
       Hamas and Israel, Eylon Levy described it as a "very difficult
       situation" - and said it won't be easy for Israel to let
       "terrorists" go.
       As part of the deal, which will see a four-day pause in the
       fighting - now not expected to begin before Friday - Hamas will
       release 50 Israeli hostages taken during the 7 October attacks in
       exchange for 150 Palestinian women and teenagers who've been held
       in Israeli jails.
       Levy says some of the people being released have committed
       "security offences" - including "stabbing and shooting attacks".
       Despite this, he says, the government believes this is the right
       move to get hostages being held home.
       "We have an obligation as a country to bring them home safely,"
       Levy says. "We're looking forward to seeing them come home."

A significant delay to the hostage deal
       Tom Bateman
       Middle East correspondent, in Jerusalem
       The sense had been all day in Israel that, according to the
       agreement, it would be 10:00 local time on Thursday (08:00 GMT)
       that a ceasefire would begin.
       A couple of hours after that, you'd get the release of the first
       batch of hostages held by Hamas - and then Palestinian prisoners
       held by Israel would also be freed.
       But more uncertainty appeared when Daniel Hagari, the chief
       spokesman for the Israeli military, gave a briefing a few hours ago
       and said he didn’t know what time a ceasefire might start.
       We've now heard the head of Israel's National Security Council say
       that the negotiations are progressing and continuing - but hostages
       won't be released before Friday.
       That appears to be quite a significant delay - anything from 24
       hours or even beyond - to plans that had been widely briefed and
       which we understood would be taking place tomorrow.

Ceasefire also delayed
       Orla Guerin
       Reporting from Jerusalem
       An Israeli government source has told the BBC that the ceasefire
       has also been delayed.

Israeli source says there are minor issues to work though
       Orla Guerin
       Reporting from Jerusalem
       This is certainly a change at the 11th hour. Israel was gearing up
       for a hostage release as early as tomorrow morning.
       There are conflicting reports here about what has caused the
       setback; some claims that Hamas has not ratified the ceasefire
       agreement.
       Other reports say Hamas has not provided Israel with a list of the
       hostages who were to be released on the first day. And that
       mechanism is supposed to be part of the agreement.
       An Israeli government source told me in the last half hour that
       they believed these were relatively minor issues which need to be
       ironed out, and that they would be ironed out on Thursday. That
       suggests that things would be back on track on Friday if that is
       the case.
       But what we can say for certain is that this is an awful blow to
       the families. They’ve been waiting almost 50 days, hoping that
       tomorrow was finally going to bring a moment of hope.
       Now once again they have to deal with uncertainty. And I think many
       of them will believe this deal is only happening when they see it.

BreakingSenior Israeli official says no hostages will be released before
Friday
       In the last few minutes, Tzachi Hanegbi, head of the National
       Security Council of Israel, has said Israeli hostages will not be
       released by Hamas before Friday.
       "The negotiations for the release of our hostages are advancing and
       continuing constantly," he adds in a statement released by the
       office of Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu.
       It was announced last night that Israel and Hamas had reached a
       deal to exchange 50 of the hostages held in Gaza for a four-day
       pause in fighting.
       The agreement will also see 150 Palestinian women and children held
       in Israeli jails released and an increase in humanitarian aid
       allowed into Gaza.

UN agency says a four-day pause is not enough time
       We've been hearing from the UN's Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa
       about its hopes for the four-day pause in fighting under the
       Israel-Hamas deal.
       The agency is currently hosting close to a million people in its
       shelters, a spokeswoman has told the BBC.
       Tamara Alrifa says the agency needs to be able to go to the
       northern part of Gaza - an area that Israel has urged Gazans to
       leave for their own safety. It will be able do so during the pause
       in fighting "if the Israeli authorities give us security
       guarantees".
       Alrifa says Unrwa would like to send mobile clinics into shelters
       and distribute bread, flour and drinking water in the north, as it
       has been doing in the south, but four days is "definitely not
       enough for the scale and scope of the humanitarian catastrophe".
       She says the 200 trucks carrying aid that will be allowed in each
       of the four days are "very insufficient", given that around 500
       trucks used to enter Gaza per day.
       The four fuel tankers permitted to enter under the deal will bring
       about half of what Unrwa needs to run its trucks, electricity
       generators, water pumping and desalination plants, and to provide
       fuel to hospitals and bakeries, she adds.

Gaza facing child malnutrition crisis - Unicef boss

       Back to the situation in Gaza Strip itself now. The executive
       director of Unicef - the UN's agency for children - says the
       territory faces a crisis of "child wasting": a term used to
       describe the most life-threatening form of malnutrition.
       In an article published in the New York Times today, Catherine
       Russell said Unicef was projecting that the rate of child wasting
       would increase 30% in the next few months - and there were already
       more than 7,000 cases before the events of 7 October. She added
       that these were conservative estimates, and the figure could rise
       as the conflict continued.
       Severe wasting means even catching a common cold could be life
       threatening, Russell explained.
       It's hoped that the hostage deal agreed by Israel and Hamas -
       following negotiations backed by Qatar and the US - will allow
       hundreds of lorries carrying aid to enter Gaza over four days.
       Russell says to ensure Gaza's children remain healthy and stave off
       looming health issues, humanitarian partners must be permitted to
       deliver supplies after hostilities resume.

ICRC earlier said it wasn't notified of hostages visit
       As we just reported, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says
       humanitarian workers from the International Committee of the Red
       Cross (ICRC) will be able to visit hostages in Gaza who are not
       being released under the imminent deal between Israel and Hamas.
       Netanyahu disputed an earlier comment from the ICRC - which said
       the organisation hadn't received any information about visiting
       hostages in Gaza.
       In its statement (quoted by Israeli media) the ICRC said it had
       continuously asked for the release of all hostages and for their
       humane treatment since the brutal 7 October attack. But, it added:

     Quote Message: Thus far, the ICRC has not been made aware of any
     agreement reached by both parties related to visits by the ICRC to
     the hostages. Should visits be agreed upon, the ICRC stands ready to
     visit. The ICRC does not take part in the negotiations between the
     parties to the conflict." from International Committee of the Red
     Cross

     Thus far, the ICRC has not been made aware of any agreement reached
     by both parties related to visits by the ICRC to the hostages.
     Should visits be agreed upon, the ICRC stands ready to visit. The
     ICRC does not take part in the negotiations between the parties to
     the conflict."

     International Committee of the Red Cross

       We've approached the ICRC for comment on those latest comments from
       Netanyahu.

       During that press conference, we also heard Israeli Prime Minister
       Benjamin Netanyahu say it's been agreed that humanitarian workers
       from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) will be
       allowed to visit remaining hostages in Gaza.
       "I expect the Red Cross to do its job, and to visit them all and to
       bring them the medication that they need," he said.

Gantz says Israel 'slowly but surely' dismantling Hamas
       We're now hearing from Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant, who
       says the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has been working very hard in
       the Gaza Strip - from land, air and sea.
       Gallant says Israel is "slowly but surely" dismantling the military
       framework of Hamas.
       The defence minister says he recommended to the Israeli parliament
       that the IDF should go further into Gaza - to show Hamas the powers
       of Israel's military and rescue hostages.
       He says that he "sincerely" hopes that the hostage release
       agreement "will be actually executed". And he hopes the results of
       negotiations will be seen in "next few days".

Netanyahu: 'The victory has a very heavy price'

       Israel Government Press OfficeCopyright: Israel Government Press
       Office
       Netanyahu says Israel will continue to fight Hamas in the north and
       in the south, which has only been possible "thanks to the heroism
       and the courage of our children".
       He adds: "This victory has a very heavy price to pay," and
       acknowledges that some members of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
       will die during the war.
       He says he has been told by the families of soldiers killed in
       combat to continue fighting.

Post update
       Netanyahu says he expects some mothers and children to be released.
       "There were various things we just had to do," Netanyahu adds. He
       says in his job he sometimes has to make "extremely tough"
       decisions.
       He says Israel is taking advantage of every possible chance to
       bring hostages safely home.
       The PM says he was reassured during meetings yesterday that the
       safety of Israeli soldiers will be guaranteed during the "temporary
       truce".
       The Israeli military will then continue its campaign against Hamas,
       he says.

Netanyahu salutes IDF for its work
       Israeli Prime Minister Benajmin Netanyahu is first up, and
       addressing the public.
       He repeats that the aims of this war are to release the hostages
       and eliminate Hamas.
       Netanyahu says he would like to "truly salute the IDF" (the Israeli
       military) for its work, and role in the war so far.
       Talking about the conditions of the hostage release, he says no
       murderers will be released from Israeli jails.

The Israel-Hamas War: The Humanitarian Crisis in Gaza

   Calls for a cease-fire are rising worldwide as the war between Israel
   and Hamas further exacerbates the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

   On October 7, the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a massive
   surprise assault on southern Israel, the deadliest single attack on
   Israelis in history. Israel’s subsequent declaration of war against
   Hamas has further worsened an already dire situation in the Gaza Strip,
   where more than two million Palestinians live. As the violence
   escalates, some injured civilians and foreign nationals in Gaza have
   been able to leave the territory during short “humanitarian pauses,”
   but international appeals for a full cease-fire are persisting as the
   war’s death toll mounts.

   Gaza, a small territory of about 139 square miles (360 square
   kilometers), or roughly the size of the city of Detroit, was already
   experiencing a severe humanitarian crisis before the current
   hostilities broke out. As a result of a sixteen-year blockade by
   Israel, about 95 percent of the population cannot access clean water,
   while more than half of all Gazans depend on international assistance
   for basic services. Additionally, some 80 percent of Gaza’s residents
   are considered refugees under international law, and Palestinians
   overall compose the largest stateless community in the world.

   Since Hamas’s attack, the situation in Gaza has become a “catastrophe,”
   UN Secretary-General António Guterres said. According to the
   Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry, as of November 10, Israel’s
   retaliation has killed at least 11,070 people, two-thirds of them women
   and children, while some 2,650 others have been reported missing. These
   figures could not be independently verified, but outside sources have
   also put the death numbers in the thousands. At least forty journalists
   and media workers have also been killed, as well as more than one
   hundred UN employees. Hamas’s assault killed around 1,200 Israelis,
   around 70 percent of them civilians.

   Israel has imposed a complete siege of the territory, cutting off
   electricity and water, and supplies of food and medicine are dwindling
   fast. Without fuel, meanwhile, Gaza’s only power station has gone dark.
   The lack of electricity has shut down desalination and waste-water
   treatment plants, further compromising access to safe drinking water.
   Israeli air strikes have destroyed neighborhoods, schools, and mosques,
   though the Israeli military has said that it is only targeting weapons
   storage centers and infrastructure used or occupied by Hamas militants.
   However, Israeli air strikes targeting residential buildings and
   medical facilities have resulted in numerous civilian casualties.

   By the second week of November, Gaza’s health system was reported to
   have collapsed, with hospitals running low on rationed fuel reserves
   and medical supplies. Northern Gaza’s two major hospitals have already
   greatly exceeded capacity, and hospitals in the south are also
   overflowing. Beginning in November, Israeli strikes have targeted
   al-Shifa Hospital, the largest and best-equipped hospital in Gaza.
   Israeli officials claim Hamas has a command center beneath the
   facility. Meanwhile, a dispute between Israel and health authorities in
   Gaza over a potential fuel delivery has delayed fuel from reaching the
   hospital, from which thousands of people have fled. Israel’s energy
   minister said on October 12 that electricity, fuel, and water would not
   be provided to Gaza until all hostages—totaling roughly 240 people—held
   by Hamas are freed.

What are the refuge options for Palestinians in Gaza?

   On October 13, Israel ordered more than one million people living in
   northern Gaza to evacuate to the south within twenty-four hours, ahead
   of an expected ground invasion targeting Hamas. The United Nations
   called on Israel to rescind the order, saying it would be “impossible”
   to achieve without “devastating humanitarian consequences.” As of
   November 10, more than 1.6 million people, or over half of Gaza’s
   population, had been displaced.

   Gazans’ options for refuge are limited. Israel has closed its two
   border crossings with Gaza as part of its blockade. Egypt, which shares
   the Rafah border crossing with Gaza and already hosts more than 350,000
   refugees and asylum seekers [PDF], is the only viable outlet left.
   Though the Egyptian government was initially reluctant to open the
   crossing, it has since done so to allow aid trucks carrying water,
   food, and medical supplies to enter Gaza. (However, UN officials say
   the daily quota for deliveries is only a fraction of what is required
   to meet Gaza’s urgent needs.) Some foreign nationals and injured
   civilians have also been allowed to flee Gaza via the border
   crossing, which has temporarily closed several times due to Israeli
   strikes.

   With food, fuel, and water supplies rapidly dwindling, the United
   States is working with the United Nations and other international aid
   organizations to create “safe zones” [PDF] within Gaza where civilians
   can receive urgent humanitarian aid.

How are humanitarian aid organizations responding?

   In November, the United Nations launched an updated $481 million flash
   appeal to address the needs of people in Gaza and the West Bank. In
   Gaza, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and UN Relief and Works Agency
   for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) are helping to provide
   essential goods and services, such as medical supplies, fuel, and
   emergency assistance. Several other major organizations, including the
   International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement—which comprises the
   Palestine Red Crescent Society—and Doctors Without Borders, are also
   supplying humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict. As the
   fighting continues, international calls for humanitarian pauses have
   grown, including from countries in the European Union and the Group of
   Seven (G7), while members of the Arab League have pushed for a complete
   cease-fire.

St Andrews University rector urged to apologise over Israel 'genocide' claim

   The newly-elected rector of St Andrews University is facing calls to
   apologise over an email accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza.

   Stella Maris said Palestinians had suffered "apartheid, siege, illegal
   occupation and collective punishment" during the Israel-Gaza war.

   Hundreds of students have demanded that she retract her remarks or
   resign just a month after taking up the role.

   St Andrews University said it was "dismayed" by the rector's comments.

   The row came as hundreds of people attended demonstrations in Scotland
   on Saturday calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.

   In Glasgow, people gathered at the Buchanan Street steps on Saturday
   holding signs and banners which said "ceasefire now".

   First Minister Humza Yousaf and Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar took
   part in the Scottish Trades Union Congress's (STUC) annual St Andrew's
   Day protest which saw marchers gather at Glasgow Green.

   Asked about the St Andrews rector's comments he said: "There are
   communities - Jewish communities, Muslim communities - who are feeling
   vulnerable and all of us have a responsibility to make sure we are
   simmering down any of those tensions as opposed to inflaming them.

   "We can do that while very passionately arguing that what's happening
   in Gaza is unacceptable."

   permanent ceasefire

   In a message to students sent on Tuesday, Ms Maris described how a
   vigil at the university was held earlier this month "following weeks of
   genocidal attacks by the Israeli government against Gaza".

   She said: "We must continue to recognize and condemn acts that are
   internationally regarded as humanitarian and war crimes.

   "It is also crucial to acknowledge and denounce the actions by Hamas
   that qualify as war crimes, notably the taking of hostages and
   deliberately targeting civilians, which I have and continue to do."

Human rights

   The email also included a link to a website which carried a story
   headlined: "The evidence Israel killed its own citizens on Oct 7."

   The role of rector, elected by students, is to provide pastoral support
   and represent the student community at the university's governing body
   where the rector serves as president.

   Ms Maris has rejected accusations that the message to students was
   antisemitic and argued her use of the terms genocide and apartheid were
   "supported by numerous human rights organizations".

   She told BBC Scotland News she would not be resigning and insisted she
   had done the right thing.

   Ms Maris sad: "I have received a lot of backlash and it's quite
   disappointing.

   "I really tried to write a statement that would make everyone happy,
   but realised I wasn't being true to my beliefs.

   "I'm glad I did it and it was the right thing to do."

   The rector added: "I've had racist comments as a result and have been
   accused of antisemitism, which I reject.

   "I don't intend on retracting my statement or resigning.

   "I denounce antisemitism in the strongest form. Reject the weaponising
   of antisemitism."

   However, a large group of students at the university, which was founded
   in 1413 and is one of the oldest in the UK, insisted Ms Maris's
   comments "will only bring division and hatred".

   They are now calling for her to apologise or step down.

   Image caption,
   Ms Maris was elected as rector of the 610-year-old university in
   October

   In a letter to the rector, they say: "We are concerned that your letter
   does not demonstrate equal care for Palestinian and Israeli lives.

   "What is truly unacceptable is that you do not care to mention, let
   alone demonstrate regard for, the two St Andrews students who were
   recently attacked because of their religion.

   "Moreover, your letter does not show any appreciation for how your
   inflammatory and unfounded accusations of 'genocide,' 'apartheid,' and
   'occupation' concerning the Jewish State will further embolden attacks
   and hatred against the Jewish students whom you were elected to care
   for.

   "It is unacceptable for the rector to be selective in their
   responsibility to represent all students."

Free speech

   Ms Maris is a former English and philosophy graduate at the university
   and has since filled a series of student representation roles.

   She was elected rector on 10 October.

   Responding to Ms Maris's remarks, St Andrews University principal and
   vice-chancellor, Prof Dame Sally Mapstone, said the university was
   committed to free speech but that there was "no place for antisemitism,
   Islamophobia, or racism of any kind".

   She added: "We are utterly dismayed that the rector, on this occasion,
   put her right to freedom of expression ahead of her duty to represent
   all students, and to be concerned for their welfare.

   "We know that while some may have welcomed the message, others have
   been deeply offended and concerned by it.

   "While every one of us shares a desire for peace and an end to
   hostilities in Israel and Gaza, we regret that her message, the
   language it used, and some of the sources it cited have caused alarm,
   division, and harm in our community, and more widely."

Temporary truce

   The temporary truce is still holding and follows weeks of fighting and
   Israeli bombardments of Gaza, with the conflict sparked by Hamas's
   unprecedented cross-border attack in southern Israel that saw 1,200
   people killed.

   Hamas earlier announced a delay in the release of further Israeli
   hostages, claiming Israel had broken the terms of the truce deal over
   aid deliveries to northern Gaza. Israel denied this, and the releases
   were due to resume following mediation.

   On the first day of the four-day ceasefire on Friday, Hamas released 24
   of the about 240 hostages taken during its attack on Israel and Israel
   freed 39 Palestinians from prison.

   The Israeli offensive has killed more than 14,500 Palestinians,
   according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza government.

Israel-Hamas war opens up German debate over meaning of ‘Never again’

   Intellectuals clash over country’s traditional commitment to defence of
   Israel amid bloodshed in Gaza
     * Israel-Hamas war – live updates

   The phrase “Never again” has been the central tenet of Germany’s
   political identity since the horrors of the Nazi-led Holocaust of
   Europe’s Jewish population. But the war between Israel and Hamas has
   opened up a fiercely fought debate about the phrase’s true meaning,
   dividing opinion among followers of the dominant German intellectual
   tradition.

   A letter published in the Guardian pits several prominent German and
   international figures influenced by the Frankfurt School of neo-Marxist
   “critical theory” against its most prominent living member, Jürgen
   Habermas. They argue that “Never again” must also mean staying alert to
   the possibility that what is unfolding in Gaza could amount to
   genocide.

   In a statement published on 13 November, Habermas made the case that
   the “Never again” principle must above all lead to a German commitment
   to protecting Jewish life and Israel’s right to exist.

   Habermas, 94, sometimes described as a contemporary successor to the
   Enlightenment philosophers for his writing on themes of power and
   justice, argued that Israel’s military retaliation following the 7
   October Hamas attacks was “justified in principle”. Likening the
   resulting bloodshed in Gaza to a genocide was beyond the boundaries of
   acceptable debate, he said.

   “Despite all the concern for the fate of the Palestinian population
   […], the standards of judgment slip completely when genocidal
   intentions are attributed to Israel’s actions,” said the statement,
   which was also signed by the political scientist Rainer Forst, the
   lawyer Klaus Günther and the peace researcher Nicole Deitelhoff.

   In response, the letter published on Wednesday echoes Habermas’s
   condemnation of the Hamas attack and hostage-taking, but expresses
   concern over the “apparent limits of the solidarity expressed” by the
   philosopher and his co-authors.

   “The statement’s concern for human dignity is not adequately extended
   to Palestinian civilians in Gaza who are facing death and destruction,”
   it adds. “Nor is it applied or extended to Muslims in Germany
   experiencing rising Islamophobia. Solidarity means that the principle
   of human dignity must apply to all people. This requires us to
   recognise and address the suffering of all those affected by an armed
   conflict.”

   The letter continues: “We are concerned that there is no mention of
   upholding international law, which also prohibits war crimes and crimes
   against humanity such as collective punishment, persecution, and the
   destruction of civilian infrastructure including schools, hospitals and
   places of worship.”

   While “not all signatories believe that the legal standards for
   genocide have been met” by the situation in Gaza, the letter says, all
   of them “agree this is a matter of legitimate debate”.

   On Sunday, a group of UN experts said there was “evidence of increasing
   genocidal incitement” against the Palestinian people. Israeli officials
   reject this.

   The letter’s full list of more than 100 supporters includes several
   academics who have either directly emerged from the Frankfurt School or
   are employed at New York’s New School for Social Research, which sees
   itself working within the same critical theory tradition.

   Other signatories include the economist Adam Tooze, the legal historian
   Samuel Moyn, and the philosophers Amia Srinivasan and Nancy Fraser.

   More than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed by Hamas
   militants on 7 October. Since Israel’s counter-offensive was launched ,
   more than 14,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to
   Hamas-run health authorities.

   On Wednesday, Israel and Hamas agreed a deal for the release of 50
   women and children hostages held in Gaza in return for 150 Palestinian
   women and children to be freed from Israeli jails during a four-day
   ceasefire.

   Founded in 1923, the Frankfurt School applied Marxist theory to
   philosophy and social theory to make sense of the rise of fascism out
   of apparently liberal European societies. Habermas, a former assistant
   to Theodor Adorno, took a more optimistic stance than the institution’s
   founding members, seeking to build an intellectual framework for
   democratic societies operating within market capitalism.

   Habermas’s letter reflects a strong, cross-party pro-Israel consensus
   in German politics. The to-and-fro of statements comes on the back of a
   motion for a resolution put forward on 7 November by the three
   centre-left and liberal parties of Olaf Scholz’s coalition government,
   which proposes allowing the extradition of non-German citizenship
   holders who spread hatred against Jews, as well as withdrawing funding
   from cultural institutions that support the Boycott, Divest and
   Sanctions (BDS) movement.

   Critics fear such a resolution would also result in the silencing of
   legitimate criticism of Israeli policies. In Berlin, the city senate is
   considering pulling funding for the Oyoun cultural centre in the German
   capital’s Neukölln district, after the centre’s directors reportedly
   refused to cancel a peace vigil by a leftwing Jewish group.

   WASHINGTON (AP) — The negotiations hardly ran smoothly. But in the end,
   persistence paid off.

   Six weeks ago, not long after Hamas killed more than 1,200 people in
   Israel and took scores of others hostage in a surprise assault, the
   government of Qatar quietly reached out to the United States to discuss
   how to secure the release of those who were taken captive by the
   militant group.

   But the mission demanded extreme sensitivity. It was so secret that
   U.S. officials established a communications cell to reach Hamas
   directly and kept those negotiations tightly guarded throughout the
   U.S. government. Only a handful of people were aware of the talks,
   according to a senior White House official.

   The cell allowed the small circle of negotiators to speak regularly
   without additional bureaucracy. U.S. and Israeli officials spent weeks
   scrambling to put together a deal that would free dozens of hostages
   held by Hamas. The White House saw that as the only realistic way to
   halt the bloody combat that has devastated the region for more than six
   weeks.

   What does the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas look like?

   The U.S. continuously pushed Hamas, with Qatar and Egypt acting as
   critical intermediaries. All the while, President Joe Biden and other
   senior U.S. officials assured distraught family members of hostages
   through emotional Zooms and in-person meetings that they were doing
   everything they could to secure their loved ones’ release.

   The U.S. president was still working on the hostage deal as late as
   Wednesday in phone calls with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
   and other world leaders, stressing the importance of moving from
   agreement to actual releases. Biden vowed that he would not relent
   until all American hostages in Gaza were released.

   And there was a final hiccup in the agreement both sides apparently had
   reached. Talks continued, and no hostages were to be released before
   Friday.

   Biden said the White House had been working tirelessly to secure the
   release of hostages since the “earliest moments of Hamas’s brutal
   assault.”

   This account of how the hostage deal came together was described by the
   senior White House official and two Egyptian officials who were granted
   anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations, as well as accounts in
   Israeli media.

   The cell to communicate with Hamas was established by Brett McGurk, the
   National Security Council’s coordinator for the Middle East, and Joshua
   Geltzer, legal adviser to the National Security Council. McGurk would
   speak every morning with Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani,
   the Qatari prime minister, while Jake Sullivan, the White House
   national security adviser, communicated daily with his Israeli
   counterparts, with Biden being briefed throughout. Also critical was
   CIA Director Bill Burns, who had been talking with David Barnea, the
   director of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency.

   The final deal that emerged this week — during a four-day cease-fire,
   Hamas would release 50 hostages in exchange for 150 Palestinian
   prisoners held by Israel — was an agreement that evolved through the
   weeks of negotiations.

   One of the earliest proposals was put forward on Oct. 12, five days
   after the initial Hamas attack, and it called for releasing all women
   and children held by Hamas and other Palestinian militants in Gaza, in
   return for freeing all Palestinian women in Israeli prisons, according
   to the Egyptian officials.

   The Israelis rejected that initial proposal, but it “opened the door
   for more talks,” one of the Egyptian officials said.

   In repeated conversations in late October between Biden and Netanyahu,
   the Israeli prime minister underscored his red line: The attacks on
   Gaza would cease only if there was a hostage release. Biden had his own
   demand throughout the talks: Humanitarian assistance had to reach Gaza,
   regardless of a deal.

   Eventually, the first two U.S. hostages held by Hamas – Natalie and
   Judith Raanan – were released. As senior national security officials
   tracked their release out of Gaza and Biden personally phoned Natalie’s
   father to tell him of the news, the White House became more confident
   that the secret cell set up to talk with Hamas would work, and
   intensified efforts to rescue more hostages.

   Shortly after the Raanans’ release — and just before a long-anticipated
   Israeli ground invasion into Gaza — the U.S. was informed that Hamas
   had signed off on the contours of a deal that would halt the offensive
   temporarily while the women and children were released.

   But there were multiple issues, from Israel’s view: Hamas had offered
   no proof of life of any of the hostages, nor would it say who precisely
   was being held until the fighting ceased. That, for Israel, wouldn’t be
   enough to stop the ground invasion. The U.S., too, was skeptical.

   Meanwhile, Hamas’ political leaders in Beirut, Doha and Cairo accused
   Israel of stalling the talks.

   Hamas political bureau member Basem Naim told journalists in Beirut on
   Nov. 10 that the group was prepared to release the civilian hostages if
   there were guarantees of “safe movement so that we can collect
   information and data to implement this step.” He complained that Israel
   was not responsive.

   Still, the negotiations continued.

   Israel’s ground invasion plans were revised so fighting could be paused
   if a hostage deal came together. The talks — with messages being routed
   through Doha or Cairo into Gaza — veered into highly technical details,
   and proposals flew back and forth. The U.S. repeatedly pushed Hamas,
   with Doha as the intermediary, to provide identifying information for
   the women and children being held. The militant group continued to
   refuse.

   By Nov. 12, Biden had had enough.

   He called Qatar’s ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and
   demanded specifics from Hamas. For any agreement to go through, Biden
   insisted, the U.S. needed clear identifications for the estimated 50
   hostages who would be freed — ages, gender, where they were from.
   Otherwise, the deal would not go through.

   Shortly after that call, Hamas produced the information the U.S. had
   sought. Biden called Netanyahu on Nov. 14 and urged the prime minister
   to take the deal. Netanyahu agreed to move forward. In meetings with
   McGurk, Netanyahu urged the U.S. to press the Qataris to nail down the
   final terms.

   During this time, the mediators had been swapping more workable drafts
   of a hostage agreement. One version outlined a five-day cease-fire and
   the release of somewhere between 200 to 300 Palestinian women and
   children. Israel had insisted on a two-day cease-fire and the release
   of about 100 non-Hamas Palestinians.

   But Hamas then went dark. The militant group stopped talking with the
   Qataris and Egyptians, threatening to walk from the talks after the
   Israeli Defense Forces entered Shifa Hospital, the largest and
   best-equipped medical center in Gaza that Israel insists is being used
   by Hamas for military purposes.

   “Everything was to fall apart at this stage,” one of the Egyptian
   officials said. “Hamas was angry. We all were angry.”

   For three days, Egypt, Qatar and the U.S. pressured the warring sides
   to reach a compromise: Four-day cease-fire, and three Palestinian
   prisoners for each hostage. Egypt also insisted on easing Israeli
   restrictions on the flow of humanitarian aid. Talks resumed last
   Friday, and in another conversation with the Qatari emir, Biden told
   him it was the last shot at a hostage deal and he had to close it now.

   McGurk spent the next several days after that call between Biden and Al
   Thani hammering out the finer points of the hostage agreement.
   Officials also crafted a way to try to entice Hamas to release more
   hostages than the 50 already agreed to. The universe of unresolved
   issues continued to narrow until Tuesday morning, Nov. 21, when Hamas
   told Qatari officials they were on board.

   On Wednesday, Israel’s war cabinet signed off.

   “In recent days, I have spoken with our friend, US President Joe Biden
   and I requested his intervention in order to improve the outline that
   will be presented to you,” Netanyahu said as his war cabinet convened.
   “Indeed, it has been improved to include more hostages and at a lower
   cost. These talks have been productive. President Biden joined in the
   effort and I thank him for it.”

Protesters from across Ontario travel to Ottawa for largest pro-Palestine
rally yet

   Thousands of people gathered on Parliament Hill in Ottawa Saturday for
   a rally calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza on the second-day of
   a four-day pause in the fighting.

   There have been protests in Ottawa every week since the Oct. 7 Hamas
   attack, which have grown in size and scope.

   Several groups, including the Palestinian Youth Movement and Jews Say
   No to Genocide, and their supporters gathered in Ottawa Saturday
   afternoon.

   The Palestinian Youth Movement said on social media it is demanding "an
   end to Canadian complicity in the ongoing genocide in Gaza and
   colonization of Palestine" and to demand that the government call for a
   permanent ceasefire in the region. It is also demanding Canada cease
   selling weapons to Israel.

   "We call on Palestinians, Arabs, and people of conscience from all
   across Canada to make plans to travel to Ottawa on this day for what is
   sure to be a historic march: together, a people's chorus becomes
   impossible for the Canadian government to ignore," the group said.

   "We are here to call for a genuine ceasefire. Not a pause but a genuine
   ceasefire," said the Palestinian Youth Movement's Yara Shoufani. "We
   are here today in a historic march in support of the Palestinian
   people."

   The Jews Say No to Genocide group said in a news release on Friday that
   it is also calling for a permanent ceasefire, a halt to all military
   aid and arms sales to Israel and for the government to demand an end to
   the occupation of Gaza and the West Bank.

   "The continued escalation we are witnessing of the Israeli
   state-sanctioned brutality, human rights violations and crimes against
   humanity across Gaza and the West Bank must end now," the group said.

   "Canadian Jews add their voices to this global chorus calling for
   justice for the Palestinian people. As Jews, we cannot and will not
   stand idly by as the State of Israel - with the full support of the
   Canadian government - continues to commit atrocities day-in, day-out
   that go against the very core of our faith."

   According to federal government figures, Canada exported more than $21
   million worth of military goods and technology to Israel in 2022.

   Organizers say people were bussed in to Ottawa from across Ontario,
   including Toronto, Mississauga, and Kitchener-Waterloo.

   Among the crowd was Ontario MPP Sara Jama, who was ejected from the
   provincial NDP caucus over a social media post two days after the Oct.
   7 attack in which she expressed support for the Palestinian people and
   called for an end to the "occupation of Palestinian land." She was
   criticized for not mentioning Hamas or the attack. She later apologized
   and condemned Hamas, but the Progressive Conservative government
   censured her in the legislature.

   "I'm here today in support of the many Palestinians that are organizing
   to continue to put pressure on this government for a ceasefire," Jama
   said Saturday. "We know that a four-day pause is not enough."

   Ottawa Centre NDP MPP Joel Harden was also at the rally.

   "Release all hostages. End the seige, end the occupation. It’s time for
   peace with justice," he wrote on X.

   Also in attendance was Dr. Tarek Loubani, from London, Ont., who is
   facing a mischief charge after an MP's office was vandalized with
   ketchup following a demonstration in October. Loubani expressed concern
   about the lack of medical supplies in Gaza.

   "They don't have the basic composites of medical care, like water,
   soap, anesthetic," he said. "With these things absent, they aren't able
   to do their job appropriately."

   Loubani made international headlines when he was detained in Egypt
   while on his way to Gaza for a medical mission in 2013.

   In 2018, he was shot in the legs while helping wounded protesters in
   Gaza.

   After leaving Parliament Hill, demonstrators marched through downtown
   Ottawa streets.

   A four-day ceasefire in Gaza began Friday as part of an agreement
   brokered by Qatar, to free hostages and prisoners. Twenty-four Hamas
   hostages were freed Friday, including 13 Israeli citizens, 10 Thai
   nationals and one Filipino person. Israel released 39 Palestinian
   prisoners. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the war
   effort will continue after the ceasefire expires.

   Over the four days, Hamas is supposed to release at least 50 Israeli
   hostages, and Israel will free 150 Palestinian prisoners, all of them
   women and children.

   The continued release of hostages from Gaza was delayed Saturday when
   Hamas alleged Israel violated the terms of the truce; however, it was
   later agreed that Hamas would release 13 Israelis and seven other
   foreign nationals in exchange for 39 Palestinians.

   Since the war began, around 1,200 people in Israel have been killed,
   largely from Hamas's incursion on Oct. 7, while more than 13,000
   Palestinians have been killed, according the Ministry of Health in
   Hamas-controlled Gaza, most often because of Israeli airstrikes in
   retaliation for the Hamas attack.

International Red Cross concludes release of 17 Gaza-held hostages

   Published Sat, Nov 25 20237:23 AM ESTUpdated 31 Min Ago

   The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Saturday it
   had concluded the release of 17 hostages held in Gaza.

   "Our teams have transported these 17 people from within Gaza to the
   Rafah border, where they were handed over to Israeli authorities," an
   ICRC spokesperson said in an email to Reuters. The ICRC team consisted
   of eight staff members, including a doctor, traveling in four vehicles,
   he said.

   The neutral, Swiss-based organization already facilitated the release
   and transfer of Gaza-held hostages and Palestinian detainees on Friday
   under the terms of a four-day truce.

   The Gaza hostage deal was back on track after a temporary delay over a
   dispute about aid supplies to the north of the besieged enclave.

   "13 Israelis and 4 foreigners were received by ICRC and on their way to
   Rafah," Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman, Majed Al Ansari, said on
   social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.

   TV images showed Red Cross vehicles at Rafah crossing between Gaza and
   Egypt.

   A Palestinian official familiar with the diplomacy said Hamas would
   continue with the four-day truce agreed with Israel, the first break in
   fighting in seven weeks of war.

   Al Ansari earlier said a brief delay and obstacle to the hostage
   release were overcome through Qatari-Egyptian contacts with both sides,
   adding that 39 Palestinian civilians were going to be released in
   exchange.

   Among the Israeli hostages, eight were expected to be children and five
   others women, Al Ansari said, while the Palestinians to be released
   from Israeli prisons would consist of 33 children and six women.

   U.S. President Joe Biden spoke to Qatar Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al
   Thani on the hold-up over the hostage deal, Adrienne Watson,
   spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, said. About
   3-1/2 hours after their call, the White House learned from the Qataris
   that the agreement was back on and the International Committee of the
   Red Cross (ICRC) was moving to collect the hostages, Watson added.

   The armed wing of Hamas had earlier said it was delaying Saturday's
   scheduled second round of hostage releases until Israel met all truce
   conditions, including committing to let aid trucks into northern Gaza.

   Hamas spokesperson Osama Hamdan said only 65 of 340 aid trucks that had
   entered Gaza since Friday had reached northern Gaza, which was "less
   than half of what Israel agreed on."

   Al-Qassam Brigades also said Israel had failed to respect the terms of
   the Palestinian prisoner releases. Qadura Fares, the Palestinian
   commissioner for prisoners, said Israel had not released detainees by
   seniority, as was expected.

   Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter, a member of Israel's security
   cabinet, told Channel 13 News that Israel was "abiding by the deal"
   with Hamas that Qatar had mediated.

   Israel has said 50 trucks with food, water, shelter equipment and
   medical supplies had deployed to northern Gaza under UN supervision,
   the first significant aid delivery there since the start of the war.

   The brief dispute over the truce raised concerns over the smooth
   implementation of the hostage deal after 13 Israeli women and children
   were freed by Hamas on Friday. Some 39 Palestinian women and teenagers
   were released from Israeli jails.

   Israeli army spokesperson Olivier Rafowicz told French television
   Israel was strictly honoring the terms of the truce, and said the
   military had carried out no attacks or offensive operations in Gaza on
   Saturday.

Truce extended?

   A total of 50 hostages are to be exchanged for 150 Palestinian
   prisoners over four days under the truce, the first halt in fighting
   since Hamas fighters rampaged through southern Israel on Oct. 7,
   killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages.

   In response to that attack, Israel has vowed to destroy the Hamas
   militants who run Gaza, raining bombs and shells on the enclave and
   launching a ground offensive in the north. To date, some 14,800 people,
   roughly 40% of them children, have been killed, Palestinian health
   authorities said on Saturday.

   Before the delay to the latest hostage and prisoner exchange, Egypt,
   which controls the Rafah border crossing through which aid supplies
   have resumed into southern Gaza, said it had received "positive
   signals" from all parties over a possible truce extension.

   Israel has said the ceasefire could be extended if Hamas continues to
   release hostages at a rate of at least 10 per day. A Palestinian source
   has said up to 100 hostages could go free.

Dancing for joy

   The short-lived row over the truce accord's implementation contrasted
   with scenes of joy earlier in the day as hostages were reunited with
   their families.

   After almost 50 days in captivity in Gaza, nine-year-old Ohad Munder
   ran down a hospital corridor in Israel into his father's arms, footage
   released by the hospital showed.

   He and three other children released at the same time were in
   relatively good condition, Gilat Livni, the center's Director of
   Paediatrics told reporters.

   "They shared experiences, we were up with them until late at night and
   it was interesting, upsetting and moving," said Livni.

   "I dreamt we came home," said another hostage, four-year-old Raz Asher,
   as she sat in her father's arms on a hospital bed after she and her
   mother and younger sister were freed. "Now the dream came true," her
   father, Yoni, replied.

   For Palestinians, however, joy at the release of prisoners from Israeli
   jails had a bitter tinge to it. Israeli police were seen raiding the
   home of Sawsan Bkeer on Friday shortly before her daughter Marah, 24,
   was released. Israeli police declined to comment.

   "There is no real joy, even this little joy we feel as we wait," said
   Sawsan Bkeer. "We are still afraid to feel happy," she said.

   In a barbaric surprise attack launched by Hamas on October 7, more Jews
   were slaughtered than on any day since the Holocaust. Thousands of
   elite Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip infiltrated small communities
   and cities in southern Israel, where they proceeded to commit sadistic,
   repulsive crimes against humanity, filming their vile deeds and
   boasting about them to friends and family back home.

   The assault was devastating for the Israeli people. Around 1,200 people
   were killed that day (the equivalent of around 42,500 Americans,
   adjusting for population) and some 240 were kidnapped—including young
   children and elderly people—and taken into Hamas’s vast tunnel network
   beneath Gaza.

   It was also devastating for the Israeli state. On that fateful day, the
   country’s long-standing security doctrine crumbled in the face of a
   perfect storm; as a consequence, its intelligence and military
   institutions were unable to keep citizens safe. For years, the
   country’s political and military establishment had allowed intolerable
   threats to gather by seeking to maintain the status quo in the conflict
   with the Palestinians and to establish a modus vivendi with the de
   facto Hamas state in Gaza based on deterrence, aiming to extend periods
   of tranquility.

   Israel cannot return to the status quo that existed before October 7.
   The state’s task now is to bring all the hostages back home and to make
   it impossible for Hamas and other adversaries, notably the
   Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, to carry out further
   terrorist attacks against Israeli citizens or pose direct threats to
   their security. Simultaneously, the government and the political
   establishment must accept responsibility for their strategic errors.
   They should prioritize national security interests above political
   survival and work to foster unity among Israelis, preparing them for
   the demanding times and challenges that lie ahead. And once the danger
   posed by Hamas has been eliminated, Israel must renew the process of
   promoting stable security and political arrangements with the
   Palestinians.

   A necessary paradigm shift is now underway. But a paradigm can shift in
   many different directions. For the sake of Israel’s future, this one
   must push the country’s defense institutions and security strategy back
   toward certain basic principles from which they have strayed in recent
   years.

KNOW YOUR ENEMY

   Israel’s national security doctrine was initially crafted in the
   mid-twentieth century under the country’s first prime minister, David
   Ben-Gurion. Over the decades, it has been updated to include four main
   pillars: deterrence, early warning, defense, and decisive victory.

   Deterrence is an intricate art. Its waning can be discerned in real
   time, yet its definitive breakdown becomes evident only in retrospect.
   In this case, there were plenty of reasons why Hamas ceased to be
   deterred and concluded the time was right to attack. Because of
   Israel’s overreliance on deterrence, and its tacit acceptance of a
   prolonged buildup of Hamas forces in Gaza (facilitated by Iranian
   funding and expertise), the group had achieved an unusually high level
   of operational readiness to carry out a major attack. It had also
   identified significant vulnerabilities in Israel’s defenses around
   Gaza. Hamas may have calculated there was a good chance that a major
   assault and the likely Israeli response might spark violence on other
   fronts, including inside Israel—as was the case with an escalation of
   the fighting in Gaza in May 2021 that provoked clashes among Arabs and
   Jews in cities across Israel.

   Meanwhile, the progress of talks intended to produce the normalization
   of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia heightened the concerns of
   both Hamas and Iran, which fear the further consolidation of a bloc
   opposed to the Islamic Republic and its allies and proxies—the
   so-called axis of resistance—and worry about Israel’s deeper
   integration into the region. Hamas presumably believed a major attack
   would thwart this process.

     Deterrence’s waning can be discerned in real time, yet its breakdown
     becomes evident only in retrospect.

   Hamas was likely encouraged by the impression that Israel’s internal
   political crisis—sparked by extensive protests against Prime Minister
   Benjamin Netanyahu’s proposal to curtail the power of the Israeli
   Supreme Court—had diverted attention from Gaza and significantly
   undermined Israel’s social cohesion and steadfastness. It is worth
   noting that officials with Israel’s Military Intelligence Directorate,
   the chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), and the minister
   of defense had all cautioned Netanyahu about Israel appearing
   historically weak in the eyes of its adversaries. Despite these
   warnings conveyed in recent months through a series of letters,
   Netanyahu chose to disregard them.

   According to Israel’s security doctrine, when deterrence fails, the
   intelligence community assumes the vital role of providing early
   warning, enabling the IDF to prepare and respond effectively to the
   threat. But a catastrophic misconception had taken hold within the
   Israeli intelligence community in recent years, just as happened in the
   run-up to the Yom Kippur War in 1973. During that time, the
   intelligence community wrongly assessed that Egypt and Syria would not
   dare to engage in a war they could not win, failing to comprehend
   Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat’s goal of breaking the status quo.

   As a jihadi terror organization aligned with Iran and its axis of
   resistance, Hamas’s fundamental aspiration is to inflict harm on Israel
   and undermine the state, with the ultimate aim of obliterating it. But
   Israeli intelligence and decision-makers had come to believe that
   Hamas’s responsibilities in Gaza—where it essentially governed a de
   facto state of over two million Palestinians—had tempered its
   extremism. Hamas deceitfully encouraged this misperception in recent
   years, posing as a reliable actor and warning of escalation if Israel
   did not allow funding from Qatar to arrive in Gaza and did not permit
   more Gazan workers in Israel. When Israel agreed to those concessions,
   Hamas used the resulting money and the information gathered from Gazans
   allowed to work in Israel to clandestinely plot its murderous
   offensive.

   This failure to properly comprehend Hamas’s nature and its intentions
   dates back to the 2005 Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the subsequent
   Hamas coup against the Palestinian Authority there. Since then, Israel
   had operated on the premise that a deterred and weakened Hamas was
   preferable to a governance vacuum in Gaza and would allow Israel to
   focus on what it perceived as more critical strategic challenges, such
   as Iran’s nuclear aspirations and Hezbollah’s military buildup.
   Accordingly, each time a flare-up occurred in Gaza, Israel’s aim was to
   reestablish deterrence through a limited use of force. This allowed
   Hamas to carry out a long-term buildup of arms and military
   infrastructure and to improve its operational capabilities.

   When deterrence falters and early warnings fail to materialize,
   Israel’s traditional security doctrine falls back on its third pillar:
   the IDF’s defensive capabilities. In the past decade, the IDF has
   succeeded in mitigating two central threats from Gaza: rocket attacks
   (which Israel’s Iron Dome defense system intercepts) and tunnels
   infiltrating Israeli territory (which were neutralized by an
   underground antitunnel barrier that Israel completed along the border
   with Gaza in 2021). But Israel failed to imagine an aboveground
   invasion and did not reinforce defenses around Gaza in proportion to
   Hamas’s growing military capabilities, deviating from a key lesson
   learned during the Yom Kippur War: organize defense according to an
   adversary’s capabilities and not only to its assessed intentions.
   Consequently, Israeli forces in the area were outnumbered and caught
   off guard after the IDF reduced its troop presence around Gaza and
   granted leave to many soldiers during the Sukkot holiday.

   The IDF had also become overly reliant on technological means of
   defending the border, such as cameras, advanced sensors, and remotely
   operated machine guns. Hamas used drones to neutralize those tools and
   breached the barrier with bulldozers: a combination of high-tech and
   low-tech means unlike anything Israel had anticipated.

   The fourth pillar of Israel’s security doctrine is the concept of
   achieving a decisive military outcome—that is, securing an uncontested
   victory over the enemy by neutralizing both its military capabilities
   and its resolve to continue fighting. This idea has sparked extensive
   debate among experts and senior IDF leaders for many years about how to
   define “decisive outcome” and “victory” and how to apply them to
   conflicts with nonstate actors and terrorist groups. Israel now
   understands that although the jihadi ideology of Hamas may persist (as
   have those of the Islamic State, or ISIS, and al Qaeda), the IDF must
   dismantle the organization’s military capabilities.

THE GOAL IN GAZA

   In the wake of Hamas’s brutal attack, Israel has come to see that it
   cannot coexist with a jihadi Islamist state akin to ISIS at its
   doorstep in Gaza. The era of intermittent cycles of fighting and
   cease-fires in Gaza is over. What will replace it is a continuous,
   protracted military campaign, one driven not by a desire for revenge
   but grounded in Israel’s paramount security interests and an unwavering
   commitment to the safe return of the hostages being held by Hamas.

   Israel’s ground operation was only the first step, and the military
   effort will persist after the withdrawal of IDF forces from Gaza. An
   effective Israeli strategy demands the integration of several
   interrelated, parallel endeavors—military, civilian, and
   political—executed methodically within a structured framework, which
   must be continually realigned with the expectations of the Israeli
   public and combined with a diplomatic campaign that will secure the
   assistance and support that the country will need from allies and
   partners.

   This war marks a return to the conditions outlined in the Oslo accords,
   which underscored Israel’s unwillingness to tolerate an armed
   Palestinian entity on its borders. The Israeli government is also
   seeking to restore the public’s trust in the IDF and other state
   institutions and send a signal that harming Israeli citizens will yield
   an unbearable cost for the country’s adversaries and lead to their
   eventual destruction. The extent of the damage inflicted by Hamas on
   Israel demands a decisive response, even if it entails significant
   sacrifices. The people of Israel, rallying for reserve duty in
   unprecedented numbers and orchestrating volunteer organizations to aid
   survivors and displaced people, are acutely aware of the formidable
   challenge ahead and are willing to bear the necessary burdens and
   costs.

     Israel believed that Hamas’s responsibilities in Gaza had tempered
     its extremism.

   The realistic objectives of the current ground phase of the war are not
   to eliminate every Hamas operative or completely demilitarize Gaza but
   to degrade Hamas (and its sometime ally, Palestinian Islamic Jihad) as
   a fighting force, destroy its infrastructure, and eliminate the direct
   threat it poses to Israeli communities near Gaza. This will require the
   destruction of Hamas’s nerve center in Gaza City, its underground
   facilities, and all its aboveground assets, such as military
   installations, headquarters, command-and-control centers,
   communications infrastructure, weapons manufacturing facilities, and
   arms depots.

   In selecting targets to bomb or raid, the IDF painstakingly attempts to
   distinguish Hamas operatives and infrastructure from the noncombatant
   civilian population in accordance with the laws of war. This task is
   complicated by the intense density of Gaza’s population within which
   Hamas deliberately operates and entrenches its military infrastructure
   and by the network of approximately 300 miles of tunnels that Hamas has
   built during the past 15 years, subterranean fortifications that
   stretch beneath every city in Gaza, often under critical civilian
   structures such as hospitals and schools.

   To contend with the dilemma this poses, the IDF has consistently urged
   Gazans to evacuate the main operational zone in the northern part of
   Gaza and move south through secure corridors the IDF has established.
   Furthermore, the IDF refrains from striking Hamas military targets in
   which many civilians reside, allowing them to evacuate. Despite these
   precautions, the war has nevertheless produced a significant number of
   civilian casualties, frequently as a result of Hamas’s tactic of using
   civilians as human shields. Hamas obstructs the evacuation of civilians
   from operational areas and sites, and it has even targeted the secure
   crossings established by the IDF with mortars, intentionally impeding
   civilians from relocating to the southern Gaza Strip. In the face of
   such tactics, the IDF has gone to extraordinary lengths to prevent
   civilian causalities, exceeding the precautions taken by the militaries
   of most other democratic countries. As the war progresses, the IDF must
   maintain those standards, consistently communicate and demonstrate its
   commitment to adhere to the laws of war, and acknowledge any lapses on
   its own part.

   To alleviate human suffering and to maintain the legitimacy of its
   military effort, Israel has permitted the entry of humanitarian aid
   into Gaza through Egypt. This excludes supplies that would directly aid
   Hamas’s war effort, however, such as fuel beyond the amount required
   for operations that meet humanitarian needs such as hospitals,
   bakeries, water desalination, and sewage pumping. It was, after all,
   the influx of goods and energy that Israel allowed into Gaza in recent
   years that enabled Hamas to build the terrorist army that attacked
   Israeli territory on October 7.

   The ground operation will end only when Hamas ceases to function as a
   governing authority in Gaza and its military capabilities are
   significantly degraded. At that point, the campaign will transition to
   a new phase, likely spanning several years, at least until all the
   hostages have been released and have returned home safely. Targeted
   incursions into Gaza and airstrikes against Hamas will persist, and
   Israel will need to fortify a number of strategically significant areas
   near the border with Gaza to create a buffer zone to enhance border
   defense.

   Meanwhile, the IDF will need to keep an eye on the Lebanese border.
   Israel wants to keep Hezbollah out of the conflict but is prepared for
   a potential escalation on its northern border, whether due to a
   miscalculation or to an Iranian decision to order its proxy to open a
   new front in the war.

   Following the conclusion of the main ground operation in Gaza, Israel
   will need to confront the substantial threat posed by Hezbollah’s elite
   Radwan forces stationed along the Israeli-Lebanese border. These forces
   are a significant menace to Israel’s northern villages and cities,
   which had already been evacuated at the onset of the war in Gaza.
   Israel must mobilize international pressure on Lebanon and Hezbollah to
   enforce and abide by the provisions of UN Security Council Resolution
   1701, which prohibits Hezbollah (and any armed forces other than UN
   peacekeepers and the Lebanese military) from maintaining a military
   presence south of the Litani River, which runs about 18 miles north of
   the Israeli border, with the nearest point only 2.5 miles from the
   border. If diplomatic efforts prove unsuccessful, Israel will stand
   ready to take military action, even at the risk of escalating the
   hostilities into a broader conflict with Hezbollah.

GAZA AND GEOPOLITICS

   To win this war, Israel will require the support of partners who share
   its strategic interests. A number of Arab states, the United States,
   and European countries will play pivotal roles. Their contributions
   will encompass military funding and support, a global campaign to
   curtail Hamas’s funding, humanitarian assistance for civilians and
   displaced persons within Gaza (and possibly beyond), reconstruction
   efforts, information campaigns to counter anti-Israeli and anti-Jewish
   propaganda worldwide, and, most crucially, the establishment of a
   legitimate governing authority in Gaza.

   Under the leadership of President Joe Biden, the United States has
   played an important role in Israel’s wartime decision-making,
   counseling restraint to prevent escalation in the north, demanding
   adherence to the laws of armed conflict, and pushing Israel to address
   the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. In the weeks since October 7, the
   Biden administration has deployed an unprecedented level of military
   aid and support. Aircraft carriers and U.S. forces have been rushed to
   the region on an unparalleled scale, intended to deter Iran and
   Hezbollah from intervening in the war, to protect American forces in
   the area from numerous attacks by other Iranian-backed Shiite militias,
   and to offer a robust response to such attacks. It is noteworthy,
   however, that Israel maintains its fundamental principle of defending
   itself by itself, refraining from requesting U.S. involvement at the
   cost of U.S. casualties.

   Many European countries have also demonstrated unwavering support for
   Israel, extending beyond their immediate concerns regarding the safety
   of the European citizens held hostage by Hamas. High-ranking European
   leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor
   Olaf Scholz, and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have visited Israel
   to express solidarity. During his visit in late October, Macron even
   called for the establishment of an international coalition to combat
   Hamas, modeled on the one that has taken on ISIS since 2014.

   To secure the ongoing assistance of American and European leaders, many
   of whom are contending with domestic criticism of their support, Israel
   needs to enhance its geopolitical alignment with the bloc best
   represented by the United States and its NATO allies. This may involve
   a reevaluation of Israel’s Ukraine policy, potentially leading to
   increased support for Kyiv’s defense against Russian aggression.
   Additionally, Israel should strive to further increase humanitarian aid
   to Gaza, make clear that it does not intend to permanently occupy the
   territory, consistently reaffirm its adherence to the laws of war (and
   acknowledge any errors in that regard), and place its mission in Gaza
   within the context of a broader Israeli-Palestinian political process
   that can advance robust security arrangements and sustain the viability
   of the two-state solution.

     The era of intermittent cycles of fighting and cease-fires in Gaza
     is over.

   In public, the leaders of many Arab states, including those with whom
   Israel maintains relations, have roundly condemned its war in Gaza,
   driven by the fear of unrest and domestic instability. Behind closed
   doors, however, they worry about the threat of a resurgent Hamas, an
   extremist Muslim Brotherhood organization that has always posed a grave
   threat to Arab regimes—and serves the interests of their primary
   regional rival, Iran. Governments in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and
   the United Arab Emirates fear that any success Hamas achieves in the
   current struggle will embolden Sunni jihadi forces in their own
   countries and Shiite militias that Iran backs in nearby states such as
   Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen.

   In terms of securing global support for the war against Hamas outside
   of Europe, the United States, and the Gulf, the picture darkens. China
   and Russia have abstained from publicly condemning the Hamas attack,
   have sought to curtail Israel’s efforts to dismantle the organization
   by calling for an immediate cease-fire, and have unleashed anti-Semitic
   propaganda on social media and state-controlled media outlets. For its
   part, Russia is driven by a desire to divert the West’s attention and
   resources away from the war in Ukraine and believes it will benefit
   from a heightened Middle East conflict. There is little reason to think
   Israel can do anything to change Moscow’s orientation.

   China’s position, however, is more nuanced. More than anything, the
   country fears a regional conflict that could trigger a surge in oil
   prices that might damage its flagging post-COVID economic recovery.
   Given Israel’s alignment with the West and the United States, it might
   be difficult for Israel to influence China’s policy toward its war
   efforts in Gaza. But Israel could leverage Beijing’s concerns about
   regional escalation to encourage it to pressure Iran to restrain
   Hezbollah and its proxies in Iraq and Yemen. Simultaneously, Israel
   must strengthen its strategic ties with India, which has notably
   supported Israel and condemned the Hamas attack; strong relations with
   New Delhi could help counter the criticism Israel faces from other
   countries in the global South.

THE STRUGGLE BACK HOME

   Alongside the complex military and diplomatic operations, Israeli
   leaders must launch a number of initiatives at home that will be no
   less challenging. First, they must begin to restore a sense of
   normality in a traumatized society, beginning with the rebuilding of
   the communities near Gaza’s border devastated by the Hamas attack and
   the repatriation of residents who fled their homes in Israel’s north as
   a precaution against an attack by Hezbollah. Economic activities
   throughout Israel should recommence immediately and should gradually
   return to their customary levels.

   More fundamentally, the government must work to restore trust in the
   state’s institutions among Israeli citizens. This will require new and
   unified leadership, the coordinated mobilization of all government
   ministries, and an official investigation into the origins of the Hamas
   attack. The current government—and especially Netanyahu—is unfit for
   this task. He and his close allies, after all, are responsible for the
   failure to address the problem of Gaza and Hamas over the past 15 years
   and for the unprecedented rift in Israeli society that reduced its
   preparedness in the months leading up to the attack. Israel will have
   to hold elections as soon as possible after the ground operation in
   Gaza ends, as long as security conditions, including in the north,
   allow for it.

   Even before the main ground operation concludes and Israeli troops
   withdraw, Israel should initiate a dialogue with Arab countries and
   international partners to formulate a plan for the future governance of
   Gaza. The most promising approach would be the establishment of an
   interim administration to oversee the territory until the Palestinian
   Authority is capable of assuming that role. This administration would
   be led by the United States and the five Arab states that have
   established peace agreements with Israel. To pave the way for the PA’s
   eventual return to Gaza, the international community, with Israeli
   assistance and coordination, must work with the PA to build its
   governing capacities and address the corruption in its ranks.

   Significant backing from the affluent Gulf Arab states will be
   indispensable to tackle the diverse economic, political, and security
   aspects of governance in Gaza. In this regard, the renewal of
   normalization talks between Israel and Saudi Arabia is crucial, as will
   be the integration of the kingdom into the project of governing Gaza.
   Tehran’s role in helping Hamas develop in recent years may have
   heightened the level of interest in normalization within the
   anti-Iranian bloc of Arab countries. A new Israeli government committed
   to strengthening the PA and maintaining an open perspective on a
   two-state solution could further propel the normalization process
   forward.

   A war against Hamas and the possibility of discussing a two-state
   solution may appear to sit uneasily. But since its inception, Hamas has
   opposed and undermined the prospect of two states; whenever talks
   between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization seemed to gain
   momentum, Hamas reliably launched terror attacks. The organization
   adamantly rejects the Oslo accords, refuses to acknowledge Israel’s
   right to exist, and openly pursues its destruction. Consequently, the
   removal of Hamas from power in Gaza is not an impediment to the
   two-state idea: it is a necessary (although not sufficient) condition
   for any positive advancements in the Israeli-Palestinian relationship
   and in the Middle East in general.

BACK TO BASICS

   In the wake of the trauma of October 7, Israel finds itself in a new
   reality. Going forward, it will have to set aside perceptions, beliefs,
   and assumptions that have become customary in recent years and return
   to some foundational principles that it has neglected.

   To deal with the presence of threatening military forces along its
   borders, Israel may find it necessary to shift from a reactive strategy
   of retaliation to a more proactive approach involving preventive
   strikes. Dismantling the Hamas regime in Gaza will help restore
   deterrence. The country will also need to reassess, enhance, and
   potentially overhaul its early-warning system, especially by increasing
   the use of human intelligence sources. The IDF will also need to shift
   its focus to anticipating breaches and building secondary lines of
   defense. The onus of achieving decisive outcomes will always rest on
   Israel’s shoulders. Despite Israel’s enduring commitment to
   self-reliance, however, it may prove necessary to formulate a more
   closely coordinated joint strategy with the United States, the
   country’s most steadfast ally, and even some additional partners.

   The last time Israel faced a challenge even remotely like this was in
   1973. And at first, the Yom Kippur War seemed like a defeat for Israel;
   the Arab states certainly saw it that way. In the end, however, Israel
   came out on top, and its victory led to a groundbreaking peace
   agreement with Egypt—an outcome that set in motion virtually every
   positive development that has taken place in the region since then. It
   is too early to tell whether Israel will be able to once again turn
   suffering and loss into peace and progress. But even in this grim new
   reality, there is some cause for hope.

Hamas frees 10 Thai citizens, one Filipino under separate deal: Qatar

   Their release was outside of truce between Israel and Hamas, in which
   13 Israelis were freed for 39 Palestinians.

   Published On 24 Nov 202324 Nov 2023

   Hamas has released a group of 10 Thai nationals and one citizen from
   the Philippines who were being held in Gaza, as part of a separate
   agreement to the one between Israel and the Palestinian group that saw
   Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners being freed.

   Majed al-Ansari, a spokesperson of the foreign ministry in Qatar –
   which has played a key mediating role – said on Friday that the Thai
   nationals and Filipino were among a total of 24 captives who were
   released.

   The Thai nationals, he said, were “currently on their way out of the
   strip” with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).

   They were not covered by the truce deal between Hamas and Israel, and
   Qatar and Egypt mediated a separate deal with Hamas, Thai officials
   said.

   That negotiation track was opened when Thailand’s foreign minister
   visited Qatar on October 31, which led to a specific agreement with
   Hamas to release the Thais, the officials added. Thai nationals were
   the single biggest group of foreigners taken captive.

   But Thailand’s Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin posted earlier on X that
   he had received confirmation of the release of 12 nationals and that
   Thai embassy officials were to pick them up.

   The group was brought to Rafah and then to the Karem Abu Salem
   crossing, called Kerem Shalom by Israel, east of the Rafah crossing
   between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign
   Affairs said. They were transported to a processing point at the
   Hatzerim Air Force base and were to be taken to the Shamir Medical
   Centre, southeast of Tel Aviv.

   “At this time, the gender and names of these Thais are not known,” the
   ministry statement said.

   Apart from Qatar and Egypt, the ministry also thanked Israel, Iran,
   Malaysia and the ICRC.

   Iran and Thailand maintain friendly relations and prominent members of
   Thailand’s Muslim minority made unofficial trips to Tehran to seek the
   captives’ freedom, The Associated Press news agency reported.

   Thai Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara had said that his
   Iranian counterpart, who was serving as Thailand’s intermediary with
   Hamas, had told him there would be “good news soon”, the report said.

   At least 23 Thai workers are believed to be among the estimated 240
   people who were taken captive by Hamas during the October 7 attack.

   An additional 32 Thai workers were killed in the attack in southern
   Israel.

   According to the Thai ministry, some 30,000 Thais were employed mainly
   in Israel’s agricultural sector at the time of the attack. More than
   8,600 Thai workers have been voluntarily repatriated since then.

   Under an agreement with Israel, Thai workers are paid a minimum wage of
   5,300 shekels a month ($2,000), six or seven times more than they earn
   at home.

   Qatar has led weeks of intense negotiations, coordinating with the
   United States and Egypt, to reach an agreement for the freeing of 50
   civilian hostages from Gaza in return for the release of Palestinian
   prisoners, a brief truce and access to humanitarian aid.

   Thirteen Israelis, including dual nationals, were released by Hamas on
   Friday.

   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged that the captive
   release deal would not spell the end of the war, saying Israel would
   continue its push to “eliminate” Hamas.

   Benny Gantz, a part of Israel’s war cabinet, reiterated at a solidarity
   rally for the families of captives in Tel Aviv that the army will
   resume fighting after the humanitarian pause.

   “I want to assure the families of all the hostages: We will not stop.
   We will resume the efforts and the military action in Gaza to retrieve
   the hostages and restore deterrence,” Gantz said.

   In his first statement since the Israeli captives were released,
   Netanyahu said that their return was “one of the aims of the war and we
   are committed to achieving all the aims of the war”.

IDF confirms released hostages are inside Israel

   The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have confirmed that the Israeli
   hostages freed from Gaza are now in Israel and have undergone medical
   checks.

   A statement from the IDF reads:

     The released hostages underwent an initial medical assessment inside
     Israeli territory. They will continue to be accompanied by IDF
     soldiers as they make their way to Israeli hospitals, where they
     will be reunited with their families.

   Axios’ Barak Ravid has shared the full IDF statement in English:

Closing summary

   It’s turned 7.15am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv and we’ll close this blog
   in a moment. Our live coverage of the Israel-Hamas war will resume
   soon, and in the meantime you can see all our coverage here. Here’s
   where things stand.
     * The first group of hostages were released by Hamas – 13 Israelis,
       10 Thais and a Philippine national – on Friday. The 13 Israelis,
       who included very young children and older women, had reached their
       home country by early evening. The Thai ministry said it “will do
       all possible to expedite” the return of their nationals to
       Thailand. Israel has received a list of hostages who are expected
       to be released by Hamas on Saturday, Israeli prime minister
       Benjamin Netanyahu’s office says.
     * Thirty-nine Palestinian prisoners were released by Israel on Friday
       evening. They consisted of 24 women, including some convicted of
       attempted murder for attacks on Israeli forces, and 15 teenagers
       jailed for offences such as throwing stones. Celebrations have been
       taking place in the occupied West Bank following their release.
     * The hostage release came as part of a deal that has brought about a
       temporary pause in hostilities, with the four-day ceasefire marking
       the first break in seven weeks of war in Gaza. Under the agreement,
       Hamas is due to free at least 50 of the about 240 mostly Israeli
       hostages it has held since launching attacks into southern Israel
       on 7 October in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed.
       In return, Israel will release at least 150 Palestinian prisoners
       and allow up to 300 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
     * The families of the 10 Thai hostages released on Friday had been
       notified, Thailand’s ministry of foreign affairs said, and the
       group was now with officials from the Thai embassy. The ministry
       also said there were now an estimated 20 Thai nationals who were
       still being held in Gaza.
     * US president Joe Biden said the chances were “real” that a
       temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be extended.
       Biden said Friday’s hostage release was the “start of a process”
       and that he “will not stop” until all remaining hostages in Gaza
       were brought home. The deal reached by Israel and Hamas involved
       “extensive US diplomacy”, he said, adding: “It’s only a start, but
       so far it’s gone well.” Biden also said he expected American
       citizens to be among the hostages who would be released.
     * Most of the Israeli hostages released by Hamas were said to be in
       good health after returning to Israel, the hospital receiving them
       announced. Schneider Children’s hospital, where four women and four
       child hostages were released, said doctors had conducted a
       preliminary examination and said they were all in in good physical
       condition.
     * Some 137 trucks of goods were offloaded by the UN agency for
       Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reception point in the Gaza Strip on
       Friday. The UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs
       said it was “the biggest humanitarian convoy received” in Gaza
       since 7 October. In addition, 129,000 litres of fuel and four
       trucks of gas also crossed into Gaza, it said.
     * Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos said on X that he was
       “overjoyed” to confirm that a Filipino, Gelienor “Jimmy” Pacheco,
       was among the first group of hostages released on Friday. Pacheco
       was working as a carer when he was captured by Hamas during the 7
       October attacks.
     * The World Health Organisation has voiced concern about the fate of
       the head of Gaza City’s al-Shifa hospital, whom Israeli forces
       detained over the facility’s alleged use by Hamas.
     * Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters are expected to
       gather in London for the latest demonstration calling for a
       permanent ceasefire in Gaza. The Metropolitan police will be on
       high alert and about 1,500 officers will be deployed for the
       protests on Saturday.
     * The Israeli offensive on Gaza has killed more than 14,000 people,
       thousands of them children, according to Palestinian officials.
       More are thought to be buried under rubble. At least 1,200 people,
       mostly civilians, were killed in the Hamas attacks on 7 October,
       and more than 240 people taken hostage.

   The war is paused, but it is not over.

   There will be relief at the promised four days of quiet between Israel
   and Hamas, and there will be joy for the families waiting to be
   reunited with loved ones, thanks to Friday’s exchange of hostages held
   in Gaza for prisoners held in Israel.

   But even if the ceasefire is extended, perhaps in return for the
   release of more Hamas-held captives, this war will not be over anytime
   soon. If anything, it is likely to intensify.

   It is too big to stop now, it runs too deep. And it has already turned
   Israel upside down.

   You only have to spend a few days in the country to see that. The war
   is everywhere.

   In case you missed this earlier, Jonathan Freedland has spoken to
   survivors, displaced people and senior political and military figures
   about life in Israel before and after 7 October, and considers the
   longer-term ramifications:

WHO concerned for arrested al-Shifa hospital chief

   The World Health Organisation has voiced concern about the fate of the
   head of Gaza City’s al-Shifa hospital, whom Israeli forces detained
   over the facility’s alleged use by Hamas.

   The WHO said in a statement that the chief of the Gaza Strip’s biggest
   hospital, Mohammad Abu Salmiya, had been arrested on Wednesday along
   with five other health workers while they were taking part in a UN
   mission to evacuate patients, Agence France-Presse reports.

   “Three medical personnel from the Palestine Red Crescent Society and
   three from the ministry of health were detained,” the WHO said.

   Since then two of the six have reportedly been released, but “we do not
   have information about the well-being of the four remaining health
   staff, including the director of al-Shifa hospital”, the statement
   added.

   The UN agency called for “their legal and human rights to be fully
   observed during their detention”.

   A spokesperson for the Israeli army said on Saturday that Abu Salmiya
   was being questioned. Doron Spielman said:

     We are currently moving forward with... questioning him over the
     fact that he was the head of a hospital that was really sitting on
     top of an entire terror network.

     How could he not know what’s happening? We have hostages that were
     on, you know, CCTV in his hospital.

   The Israeli army, which raided the hospital last week, has alleged
   Hamas fighters used a tunnel complex beneath the facility. Hamas and
   hospital officials have repeatedly denied the claims.

   During the WHO’s latest mission to the hospital on Wednesday – carried
   out in cooperation with the Palestine Red Crescent – 151 people were
   evacuated, including patients, their relatives and healthcare workers,
   according to the WHO.

Israel reviews list of Hamas hostages to be freed on Saturday

   Israel has received a list of hostages set to be freed by Hamas from
   Gaza on Saturday, Israeli officials said, following the release of 24
   hostages on Friday – the first of a planned four-day ceasefire.

   Reuters reports that Israeli security officials were reviewing the
   list, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement,
   after his government’s vow to work for the release of all hostages
   taken by Hamas in the militant group’s attack on southern Israel on 7
   October.

   The pause in the fighting was the first such break, with both sides
   saying hostilities would resume as soon as the truce ends. US president
   Joe Biden, however, expressed hope the pause could be extended.

   The released hostages, including Israeli women and children and Thai
   farm workers, were transferred from Gaza and handed to Egyptian
   authorities at the Rafah border crossing, along with eight staff of the
   International Committee of the Red Cross in a four-car convoy, the
   organisation said.

   They were then taken to Israel for medical checks and reunions with
   relatives.

Twenty Thais still captive in Gaza, says Thailand, after 10 freed

   Thailand’s ministry of foreign affairs said the families of the 10 Thai
   hostages released by Hamas on Friday had been notified, and the group
   was now with officials from the Thai embassy.

   The ministry said in a statement.

     This group will stay in the hospital for at least 48 hours, while
     RTE [the royal Thai embassy] will make all the necessary
     arrangements for their travel back to Thailand and their families as
     soon as possible.

   The ministry has confirmed that 10 Thai hostages were released on
   Friday, not 12 as was initially suggested by Thai authorities.

     Families have been notified and the group is now with embassy
     officials. There are now an estimated 20 Thai nationals still being

     confirmed as hostages) pic.twitter.com/Eb6PDvc4dY
     — Rebecca Ratcliffe (@rebeccarat) November 25, 2023

   The ministry also said there were now an estimated 20 Thai nationals
   who were still being held in Gaza. It was previously thought that at
   least 26 Thai nationals had been abducted, including the 10 people
   recently released. However, of the group of 10 released on Friday, four
   had not previously been confirmed as hostages.

   The ministry thanked all governments and organisations who helped to
   secure Friday’s release, saying:

     The Thai government would like to express, once again, its deepest
     appreciation to all of the parties from whom the Thai authorities
     had sought assistance and support, such as the governments of Qatar,
     Israel, Egypt, Iran, Malaysia and the ICRC [International Committee
     of the Red Cross], as well as others involved in the immense efforts
     that led to this recent release.

     We sincerely hope that the remaining hostages will be treated
     humanely and released safely as soon as possible.

   Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos has said on X that he is
   “overjoyed” to confirm that a Filipino, Gelienor “Jimmy” Pacheco, was
   among the first group of hostages released on Friday.
   Pacheco was working as a carer when he was captured by Hamas during the
   7 October attacks.
   Marcos added:

     He is now safely in the custody of officials in our Israel Embassy.
     I salute the work of the Philippine Foreign Service in securing his
     release, and once again thank the State of Qatar for their
     invaluable assistance in making Jimmy’s release possible.

   Marcos said the search for a second missing person continued.

     We remain concerned over the whereabouts of our other national, Ms
     Noralyn Babadilla, and are sparing no effort to locate and secure
     her if she is indeed found to be one of the hostages. We pray for
     the continued success of the truce and for all hostages to be
     released.

     I am overjoyed to confirm that a Filipino, Mr. Gelienor “Jimmy”
     Pacheco, was among the first group of 24 hostages released by the

   The Metropolitan police said officers would hand out leaflets to
   provide “absolute clarity” on what would be deemed at Saturday’s
   pro-Palestinian rally in London, where tens of thousands are expected
   to call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.

   Deputy assistant commissioner Ade Adelekan said:

     This sets out that anyone who is racist or incites hatred against
     any group should expect to be arrested. As should anyone who
     supports Hamas or any other banned organisation.

   Organisers Stop the War coalition said such a measure was “intrusive”
   but asked anyone attending to avoid “any actions that might leave you
   or others around you open to arrest”.

   The afternoon will also see a protest by Hizb-ut-Tahrir outside the
   Egyptian embassy. It is the first by the group since 21 October, after
   a video emerged showing a man chanting “jihad”, prompting an outcry
   from politicians.

   A march organised by the charity Campaign Against Antisemitism is also
   due to take place on Sunday, with about 40,000 to 50,000 people
   expected to attend.

London police on high alert over major pro-Palestinian protest

   Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters are expected to gather
   in London for the latest demonstration calling for a permanent
   ceasefire in Gaza.

   PA Media reports that about 1,500 officers will be deployed for the
   protests, which come amid the temporary truce in the war and Hamas’
   release of 24 hostages, along with Israel’s release of 39 Palestinian
   prisoners.

   The Metropolitan police will be on high alert in the capital, after a
   previous rally on Armistice Day saw scenes of violent disorder after
   counter-protesters clashed with officers.

   The Met had come under severe pressure from politicians over the
   decision to allow that march to go ahead, with former home secretary
   Suella Braverman accusing the force of showing bias in favour of
   leftwing protesters.

   About 100,000 people are expected to march on Saturday from Park Lane
   to Whitehall, as organisers rejected the label of “hate march” deployed
   by Braverman before she was sacked by prime minister Rishi Sunak.

   Reuters has posted a video report on displaced Palestinians in Gaza
   saying they’re not being allowed to return north as the Israel-Hamas
   ceasefire continues.

   A man beside a road in Khan Younis, in the territory’s south, says in
   the video, posted on X (formerly Twitter):

     They didn’t let us go back to Gaza City to see our children. They’re
     young and don’t know their way ... No one knows what to do or how we
     will bring them back.

     We are poor people, I got them food to eat. Our hearts are aching.

   As we posted earlier, Israeli troops fatally shot two Palestinians and
   wounded 11 others on Friday as they headed toward northern Gaza,
   Associated Press reported.

   The shooting took place as hundreds of Palestinians who sought refuge
   in southern Gaza were seen trying to head back to the north, despite
   warnings by the Israeli army not to attempt to return to their homes.

   Witnesses said Israeli troops were opening fire on people trying to
   head north.

   An AP journalist saw the two bodies and the wounded as they arrived at
   a hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah in the southern half of Gaza.
   The injured people had been shot in the legs.

   For the families of the Israelis hostages freed by Hamas, there was
   happiness mingled with concern for those who remained in Gaza, Reuters
   reports.

   “I am happy I received my family back, it’s allowed to feel joy and
   it’s allowed to shed a tear. That’s a human thing,” said Yoni Katz
   Asher, whose wife Doron and children Raz and Aviv were freed on Friday.

     But I am not celebrating, I will not celebrate until the last of the
     hostages returns home.

   Israeli leaders have sworn to free the rest of the hostages as the
   military pursues its invasion of Gaza in the wake of Hamas’ attack on 7
   October.

   For the moment, the hostages are being kept away from the media while
   their condition is assessed. And for those whose relatives have not
   come home, the wait continues in a conflicting swirl of feelings.

   “The emotions are mixed emotions,” said Shelly Shem Tov, the mother
   Omer Shem Tov, 21, who had attended the outdoor Supernova dance
   festival that was targeted in the attack and was among those taken
   hostage. He was not among those released on Friday.

   “I’m excited for the families who today are going to hug their loved
   ones,” she said in an interview with Israel’s Channel 12.

     I am jealous. And I am sad. Mostly sad that Omer is still not coming
     home.

   Hamas released the first group of hostages – 13 Israelis, 10 Thais and
   a Philippine national – on Friday, while Israel released 39 Palestinian
   prisoners.

   Organisers of a march against antisemitism billed as Britain’s biggest
   since the second world war have demanded that the far-right leader
   Stephen Yaxley-Lennon stay away.

   Yaxley-Lennon, who uses the name Tommy Robinson, has claimed to support
   the aims of the march through central London due to be held this
   Sunday.

   Organisers say it will be the biggest protest against anti-Jewish
   hatred since the 1936 Cable Street protests against Oswald Mosley’s
   blackshirts.

   Britain’s Jewish communities have suffered a large rise in antisemitism
   since the Middle East exploded into crisis after the Hamas attacks
   against Israel on 7 October. Police said up to 50,000 people were
   expected at Sunday’s march.

   A spokesperson for Campaign Against Antisemitism said:

     Contrary to what Tommy Robinson appears to believe, the drunken
     far-right thugs who came to ‘protect the Cenotaph’ on Armistice Day,
     some of whom shouted ‘sieg heil’ or hospitalised police officers,
     are not allies of the Jewish community and are not welcome at our
     solidarity march on Sunday 26 November.

     We look forward to seeing those who genuinely support our community
     and invite all of our allies to join us and march shoulder to
     shoulder in solidarity with British Jews.

   On 11 November, Armistice Day, Robinson supporters were among those who
   attacked police after claiming to be protecting war monuments from
   pro-Palestine marchers.

   The Met deputy assistant commissioner Ade Adelekan said:

     Having spoken to the Campaign Against Antisemitism, Tommy Robinson
     is not welcome at the march on Sunday.

   Police said they were aware that Robinson might try to attend posing as
   a reporter.

WHO 'extremely concerned' about safety of patients at al-Shifa after hospital
director arrested

   The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is “extremely
   concerned” about the safety of the estimated 100 patients and health
   worker remaining at Gaza’s al-Shifa hospital.

   In a statement published today, the WHO said it did not “have
   information about the well-being” of four health workers who have been
   arrested, including the director of al-Shifa hospital.

   On Thursday, Mohammad abu Salmiya and other medics were reportedly
   arrested by members of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) as they were
   travelling with a WHO evacuation convoy.

   The WHO said it participated in a “high-risk mission” on Wednesday, in
   cooperation with the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), to transfer
   151 patients, relatives and health workers from al-Shifa.

   During the screening process by members of the IDF, three medical
   personnel from the PRCS and three from the health ministry were
   detained, it said. The statement continued:

     Two of the six detained health workers have reportedly been
     released. We do not have information about the well-being of the
     four remaining health staff, including the director of Al-Shifa
     hospital. WHO calls for their legal and human rights to be fully
     observed during their detention.

   The IDF has confirmed Abu Salmiya had been arrested and transferred to
   the Shin Bet domestic security service for further questioning. It said
   that al-Shifa “under his direct management, served as a Hamas command
   and control centre” and that Hamas fighters had sought refuge in the
   hospital.

'Real' chance of ceasefire extension, says Biden; putting conditions on
Israel aid 'worthwhile thought'

   Joe Biden has said the chances were “real” that a temporary ceasefire
   between Israel and Hamas could be extended.

   The pause in hostilities, which began this morning and will initially
   last four or five days, was announced early on Wednesday and has raised
   hopes for a more durable pause in the violence.

   The US president, speaking to reporters from Nantucket, Massachusetts
   earlier today, was asked whether the truce could be extended, Reuters
   reported. He replied:

     I think the chances are real.

   Asked what his expectations were, Biden said “I don’t know how long it
   will take,” adding:

     My expectation and hope is that as we move forward, the rest of the
     Arab world and the region is also putting pressure on all sides to
     slow this down, to bring this to an end as quickly as we can.

   He also said that conditioning military aid to Israel was a “worthwhile
   thought, but I don’t think if I started off with that we would have
   ever gotten where we are today”, AP reported.

   “It is absolutely necessary to establish a lasting humanitarian
   ceasefire to reverse the catastrophic situation that the people of the

   Sánchez.

   Alexander De Croo, Belgium’s prime minister, echoed Sánchez, saying:
   “The destruction of Gaza is unacceptable. We cannot accept that a
   society is being destroyed the way it is being destroyed.”

A roadmap for the future of Palestine

   At this critical juncture, Palestine’s leaders should come together to
   craft a clear strategy for reunifying the Palestinian people

   As Israel continues its war on Gaza, which is causing loss of life and
   displacement at a scale that has led to it being labeled a “genocide”
   by various experts, the Palestinian liberation struggle is at a
   critical juncture.

   Despite undoubtedly recognising the importance of the current moment,
   however, Palestinian political factions, including Hamas and Fatah
   among others, appear unable to come together and lay out a coherent and
   realistic vision for the future of Palestine. It’s imperative for them
   to set aside their differences, acknowledge their moral
   responsibilities to the nation, and come together to craft a clear
   strategy for reunifying the Palestinian people. Such a strategy must
   not only thwart Israel’s well-defined and openly discussed plan to
   ethnically cleanse Gaza and detach it from the Palestinian homeland,
   but also respond to Israeli efforts to displace Palestinians in the
   West Bank and Israel itself.

   end of list

   As a Palestinian from Gaza, I believe at this point in the conflict,
   opportunities are ripe for putting an end to the ongoing war in Gaza,
   uniting the Palestinian factions, and launching a new political path to
   end the occupation. There are 10 clear steps that could and should be
   taken, starting with Palestinian leaders, to achieve this and put our
   nation on a direct path towards justice, peace and statehood:
    1. First and foremost, all Palestinian factions should commit to the
       fulfilment and eventual expansion of the Qatar-brokered agreement
       to exchange Israeli captives in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners in
       Israeli jails.
    2. Hamas should declare its acceptance of and commitment to the Fatah
       reconciliation agreement it signed in Cairo in 2017. It should call
       on the Palestinian Authority to assume its responsibilities in Gaza
       and also reassert the commitment of resistance factions in Gaza to
       all agreements signed by the Palestine Liberation Organisation
       (PLO). To counter Israel’s destructive post-war plans for Gaza,
       Palestinian leaders should establish an interim governing council
       for the Strip comprising technocrats from the region. All past
       Palestinian Authority personnel from Gaza, including the police,
       should be called upon to return to their duties. This plan should
       also include retaining civilian Hamas employees, including the
       police. The reintegration of Hamas fighters and weaponry into the
       Palestinian Authority forces after the end of the war should also
       remain under consideration.
    3. Hamas should publicly acknowledge the Peace Accords signed between
       Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the
       foundation for a peace process, and agree to the scheduling of
       elections for the entire Palestinian territory within one year. In
       return, Israel should be pressured to recognise a reformed Hamas as
       a mainstream Palestinian political faction and a party to future
       negotiations.
    4. The PLO should be reactivated and reformed in a way that would
       ensure the representation of all Palestinian parties and components
       within its structures. Particular emphasis should be placed on
       empowering young Palestinians, both men and women, taking on
       consequential roles within the organisation and have a say in the
       future of Palestine. The reformed PLO should include not only
       Fatah, Hamas and other PLO factions, but also representatives from
       the Palestinian diaspora, as well as independent representatives
       from across the nation. Members of the organisation should be
       reelected every four years in free and fair elections, and it
       should be agreed that the organisation will have the final say in
       all critical issues concerning the Palestinian people until an
       independent Palestinian state is established.
    5. The reconstruction of Gaza should start immediately under
       international and Arab supervision. While the international
       community should contribute to funding the project, the brunt of
       the financial burden should be put on Israel as the occupying power
       responsible for causing the destruction. The reconstruction effort
       should be used to put Gaza on the path to achieving sustainable
       economic growth. It should also aim to address the rapid depletion
       of the Strip’s environmental resources as a result of the
       occupation, including issues relating to water and electricity
       shortages, shrinking fishing areas, and destruction of agricultural
       land among others.
    6. Israel should be made to set up a compensation fund for the
       families – both Israeli and Palestinian – victimised by its wars,
       aggressions and occupation. Western countries adopted the idea that
       Russia would be compelled to pay for its war in Ukraine, and
       Ukraine would be rebuilt using frozen Russian assets. The
       Palestinian leadership should insist that the same responsibility
       is imposed on Israel.
    7. International observers should be deployed along Israel’s borders
       to prevent confrontations. Turkiye [Turkey], which is accepted as
       an honest broker by the Palestinians and has strong relations with
       the West and Israel as a NATO member, could be asked to take on
       this important responsibility.
    8. The siege on Gaza should be lifted, fully and unconditionally, with
       its border crossings, airports and ports reopened and its residents
       given full freedom of movement. A permanent and secure passage
       between Gaza and the West Bank should also be established. Turkiye
       can also play a crucial role in opening Gaza up to the world, by
       establishing maritime and aerial bridges for reconstruction and
       development.
    9. Israel should be pressured to immediately and unconditionally halt
       all its settlement activities and initiate comprehensive
       negotiations for bringing an end to its occupation under UN
       auspices, based on the 1967 borders, and within a pre-set timeframe
       of no more than three years. The Arab League should continue to
       push for its 2002 Arab Peace Initiative which called for all Arab
       states to recognise and normalise relations with Israel in exchange
       for the establishment of a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders,
       with East Jerusalem as its capital. Any further attempts at
       normalisation should be frozen until this is achieved.
   10. Finally, if this political track towards sustainable peace and
       dignified co-existence fails or faces a significant roadblock, a
       reformed PLO that is kept in check by the Palestinian people
       through regular elections should be accepted as the sole entity
       that could decide on the future direction and nature of the
       Palestinian struggle for liberation.

Israel-Hamas war: North Korea's bloody fingerprints are over October 7 - opinion

North Korea has shown itself to be nothing less than an enemy of Israel. It has
close ties with Iran and Syria and has backed Hamas and Hezbollah.

   In the seven weeks since Hamas invaded Israel and massacred over 1,200
   people, growing international attention has been directed toward the
   terrorist organization’s primary backers and paymasters, chief among
   them Iran and Qatar.

   The two autocratic regimes, which have provided Hamas with various
   forms of support over the course of many years, both bear
   responsibility for the savagery that was inflicted by their Gaza-based
   client. Largely overlooked, however, has been the role of yet another
   nefarious dictatorship, one that also deserves to be held to account
   for the part that it played in the largest mass murder of Jews since
   the Holocaust.

   While its capital city of Pyongyang may be 8,000 kilometers away, the
   North Korean regime’s bloody fingerprints are in fact all over the
   October 7 Hamas atrocities. And Kim Jong Un’s evil Stalinist state must
   not go unpunished for the chaos that it helped to unleash. Although
   North Korea’s state-run news agency has vehemently denied any
   involvement, the facts on the ground indicate otherwise.

  How did North Korea help Hamas carry out the October 7 massacre against
  Israel?

   To begin with, Hamas used weapons that were made in the Hermit
   Kingdom.

   On October 19, the Associated Press (AP) reported, based on information
   provided by South Korean officials, two experts on North Korean arms,
   as well as the AP’s own analysis of weapons captured by Israel on the
   battlefield, that Hamas was using Pyongyang’s F-7 rocket-propelled
   grenade, or RPGs.

   “North Korea has long supported Palestinian militant [terrorist]
   groups, and North Korean arms have previously been documented amongst
   interdicted supplies,” arms expert N.R. Jenzen-Jones told AP.

   He further added, based on video imagery of the October 7 assault, that
   the terrorist group was employing North Korea’s Type 58 self-loading
   rifle, a variant of the Kalashnikov assault rifle. In other words, it
   is highly likely that at least some of the Israelis who were murdered
   by Hamas died at the hands of weapons provided by North Korea. Indeed,
   on October 26, Agence France-Presse quoted an Israeli military official
   as saying that 10% of the weapons used by Hamas in the attacks had
   originated in North Korea. South Korean military and intelligence
   sources concur.

   On October 17, a senior official from South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of
   Staff was quoted by UPI as saying, “Hamas is believed to be directly or
   indirectly linked to North Korea in various areas, such as the weapons
   trade, tactical guidance, and training.”

   “The official also noted,” the report said, “that North Korean-made
   122-mm. multiple rocket launchers were provided to an armed group
   related to Hamas, and artillery shells marked ‘Bang-122’ – the same as
   ammunition used by North Korea – were found on the Israel-Gaza border.”

   In addition to providing Hamas with the means to murder, Pyongyang may
   also have assisted with the know-how.

   Back in December 2016, Kim Jong Un publicly presided over a military
   training exercise of North Korean paragliders simulating an assault on
   the South Korean presidential residence in Seoul. And that tactic is
   precisely what Hamas utilized as part of its coordinated attack on
   Israel on October 7.

   “There is a possibility that this know-how was passed on to Hamas,” the
   South Korean official told UPI. His remarks were later confirmed by the
   South Korean Defense Ministry.

   THE RELATIONSHIP between Hamas and North Korea is actually not new and
   stretches back for years.

   Nearly a decade ago, on July 26, 2014, the UK Daily Telegraph reported
   that Hamas had made a down payment to Pyongyang to acquire missiles and
   communications equipment as part of a larger arms deal. The paper noted
   that “Hamas has forged close links with North Korea, which is keen to
   support groups that are opposed to Western interests in the region.” It
   also cited unnamed Israeli military commanders as saying that North
   Korean experts had been advising Hamas on how to build its network of
   underground terror tunnels based on those that Pyongyang constructed
   decades ago beneath the demilitarized zone with South Korea.

   Prior to that, in 2009, a shipment from North Korea of 35 tons of
   military materiel, which included rockets, was seized in Thailand. It
   was later revealed that it had been intended for delivery to Iran,
   which was planning to smuggle the weapons to Hamas in Gaza and
   Hezbollah in Lebanon.

   And last month, in an article on the 38 North website, a publication of
   the Stimson Center, Dr. Samuel Ramani highlighted the history of “North
   Korea’s covert alliance with Iran-aligned militias in the Middle East.”

   These ties stretch back to the 1970s when Pyongyang provided weapons to
   Yasser Arafat and training to other Palestinian terrorist groups.

   By any measure, North Korea has shown itself to be nothing less than an
   enemy of Israel. It has close ties with Iran and Syria, has backed
   Hamas and Hezbollah, and provided arms and know-how to those who seek
   to destroy the Jewish state.

   Kim Jong Un may be pudgy and puerile, but he is perilous too. It is
   therefore essential that Israel take a more forceful public stand
   against North Korea and continue to strengthen relations with South
   Korea, which can serve as an important partner in trying to contain
   Pyongyang’s Middle Eastern mischief.

   And we must raise greater awareness about North Korea’s support for
   groups such as Hamas, which underlines how Kim’s regime is a force for
   instability not only in the Far East but around the globe.

   Simply put, North Korea has Jewish blood on its hands. It cannot be
   allowed to act with impunity. 

   Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his first term of office.

Israel-Hamas truce comes into effect: How it could now unfold

   With the truce the first break in fighting after seven weeks, several
   scenarios in the war are now possible.

   The mother of the longest-serving female Palestinian prisoner in
   Israeli jails is gripped with anxiety, but for once, optimism too.

   The mother of another prisoner arrested just months after he turned 18,
   is baking chocolate cake and other pastries in anticipation of his
   release.

Israel-Hamas deal: What makes a truce lead to lasting peace?

   end of list

   In Israel, a grandfather wonders whether his three-year-old
   granddaughter will be released, the toddler among six other family
   members held captive by Hamas.

   A Tel Aviv developmental psychologist, meanwhile, worries about the
   post-trauma signs in children when they return from Gaza.

   On Friday morning at 7am local time (05:00 GMT), the truce between
   Israel and Hamas came into force, marking the first break in Israel’s
   continuous seven-week bombardment of the Gaza Strip following Hamas’s
   October 7 attack on southern Israel.

   The four-day pause is expected to see the exchange of 150 Palestinian
   women and children imprisoned in Israeli jails for 50 women and
   children hostages held by Hamas. It also offers an opportunity for aid
   to filter into the battered enclave where nearly 15,000 people have
   been killed in the bombing, including more than 6,000 children.

   Israeli officials, while adamant that the truce is not an end to the
   war, have also agreed to pause fighting for an additional day for every
   further 10 captives freed by Hamas.

   With the truce the first breakthrough in coaxing a cessation of
   hostilities after weeks of fighting, several scenarios are possible now
   that it has come into effect.

   Here is a look at some of them:
   INTERACTIVE - Gaza truce deal possible scenarios-1700745219 (Al
   Jazeera)

The truce holds

   First, the truce may very well hold, the agreement respected by both
   parties.

   While the prisoners and captives are exchanged, humanitarian aid may
   enter not just southern Gaza as it has in the past few weeks, but could
   also enter northern Gaza, where Israeli forces are staging a ground
   assault, said Aboud Hamayel, a lecturer at Birzeit University in the
   occupied West Bank.

   But while humanitarian aid there will be welcomed, the truce will also
   prompt the question of what should be done with northern Gaza, as it
   has largely been emptied of Palestinians, said Sami Hamdi, the managing
   director at International Interest, a political risk firm focusing on
   the Middle East.

   “There will be increasingly loud voices demanding that these
   Palestinian families be allowed to return to northern Gaza in order to
   reverse the Israeli attempt at ethnic cleansing,” Hamdi told Al
   Jazeera.

   Despite this, the pause in fighting would be a lifeline for many
   Palestinians, an opportunity for them to recuperate and “take out
   people from under rubble”, Hamayel told Al Jazeera.

   In Israel, the return of captives may deliver a small public relations
   victory for embattled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who
   has been facing mounting pressure from their families since their
   capture, the analyst said.

   But it was international pressure in addition to the families’ pressure
   which obliged the Israeli leader to accept the truce after weeks of
   refusing similar deals, said Hamdi.

   International pressure will therefore be critical to ensuring that both
   sides uphold the truce, agreed Hamayel, with Western actors
   particularly interested in maintaining regional stability so that the
   oil economy doesn’t become too volatile.

The truce is extended

   If international pressure succeeds, or if Hamas agrees to free more of
   the 237 currently held captives, there may be the possibility that the
   truce not only sticks, but holds beyond the initial four days, for up
   to about three weeks.

   Both sides could use this longer lull in fighting to convalesce,
   rearrange their troops and gather intelligence for the next phase of
   the war, said Hamayel.

   Israel may also use the pause to scope out Hamas tunnels, which it
   hasn’t yet done, but has hinted at doing.

   Israel, while signalling it has no intention of ending the war, may
   also prefer a longer pause as the war is draining its economy and
   affecting its tourism, said Hamayel.

   Meanwhile, it may ramp up its raids in the occupied West Bank as the
   Gaza front cools, the analyst said. More than 226 people have been
   killed and more than 2,750 injured in the West Bank since October 7.

The truce breaks

   The scenario opposite the two previous ones is of the truce breaking,
   with Israel having more incentives to break it than Hamas, the analysts
   said.

   Hamas doesn’t want to lose credibility with its mediators, while the
   situation for Palestinian civilians is too dire for the group to risk
   not giving them a respite from fighting, said Hamayel.

   Meanwhile, Netanyahu has failed to achieve any of the strategic
   objectives that he claimed to be seeking when he began military
   operations, and which compel him to continue the fighting, said Hamdi.

   “He hasn’t been able to kill any high-profile Hamas officials. He
   hasn’t been able to wipe out Hamas in Gaza,’ Hamdi said.

   But Hamas and its regional allies would not take Israel’s breaking of
   the truce lightly, with the Palestinian armed group expected to fire
   missiles on Israel in response, and the possibility of a gradual
   escalation in tensions on multiple fronts of the war, said Hamayel.

   It is also possible that Hamas may break the truce, with such a
   response not only prompting Western ire at the group, but it would
   likely ramp up Israeli aggression from both the air and ground, he
   added.

   Its regional allies would still err on the side of caution, and would
   work towards pursuing a de-escalation of the conflict, said Hamdi.

A path to ending the war?

   Meanwhile, there is a concern among Israeli officials, including
   Netanyahu’s allies, that “this hostage exchange is essentially a bid to
   lure Israel into a permanent ceasefire”, said Hamdi.

   The prime minister has, as a result, been making assurances that
   military operations will continue, he added. On Thursday, Israel’s
   Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said that the war would continue for at
   least another two months after the end of the truce.

   But international pressure for a ceasefire is mounting. That was the
   majority view at a summit of the BRICS grouping earlier this week, the
   world’s most powerful bloc of emerging economies. United Nations
   Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has also called for a humanitarian
   ceasefire.

   The truce has opened up a possibility for more diplomatic engagements
   and solutions to the possible end of a bloody, bitter conflict that has
   gripped the world, said Hamayel.

Israel-Hamas conflict is the West’s war too

   Patience and tolerance towards a radical ideology that doesn’t
   recognize the legitimacy of your way of life is the greatest enemy of
   peace and coexistence.

   Gideon Sa’ar is a minister in the Israeli Government, a member of the
   Security Cabinet and chairman of the New Hope Party.

   In 2005 Israel withdrew from Gaza. It uprooted every Israeli and every
   community. Every Israeli grave was relocated. All soldiers were
   withdrawn, and military bases shuttered. Israel unilaterally withdrew
   to the pre-1967 border.

   Gaza has always been an epicenter of hate, incitement, and terrorism
   against Israel. Since Israel’s withdrawal, instead of choosing
   prosperity and peace, instead of developing Gaza into the Singapore of
   the Middle East, Hamas and Islamic Jihad decided to use the entity as a
   launching pad for their armies to wage their war against Israel.

   In the past decades and elsewhere in the Middle East (Lebanon, Yemen
   and others), Islamist terrorists have taken control and created “terror
   states” that operate and function completely differently from normal
   sovereign states.

   They’re not just a “terrorist organization” acting within the territory
   of another country. They control every aspect of the territory they
   occupy and exploit resources and civilian populations for their war
   effort. This is the phenomenon of a terrorist state.

   The barbarous attacks of Hamas on October 7 against Israeli civilians
   were an act of state madness, aside from the utter immorality of mass
   murder and rape. It is not rational to start an all-out war against a
   much stronger country. But their rationale is different. It is
   fanatical.

   To grasp the antisemitic and psychotic state of mind of this movement,
   it is enough to read Hamas’s founding charter.

   According to Hamas, the murder of Jews is a religious commandment.
   According to the charter, Jews, in their minds, are responsible for
   every war or destructive historical event, including those where Jews
   themselves were victims. Among the events, the French Revolution, the
   Communist Revolution, the First and Second World Wars, the founding of
   the League of Nations (to control the world), and the establishment of
   the UN.

   In their eyes the entire land of Israel is sacred to Muslims until the
   resurrection of the dead and therefore nobody has the authority to
   relinquish any part of it whatsoever.

   To try and legitimize the barbaric massacre that took place on October
   7 is as absurd as trying to find justification for the perverse,
   murderous attack by al-Qaeda against the U.S. on September 11 2001.
   It’s the same madness, the same extremism, the same cruel
   murderousness.

   The reason for the attack on Israel was simple: Hamas wants to destroy
   the state of Israel. Hamas’ conflict with Israel is not a territorial
   one, it is a total ideological one.

   Since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, radical Islam has become an
   ideological rival of the democratic West. Radical Islam totally rejects
   Western values and wants to destroy Western civilization — so much for
   Francis Fukuyama’s theory of “the end of history.”

   Strategically, as it did on September 11, or during terror attacks
   inspired, encouraged and sometimes organized in European cities,
   radical Islam always seeks to attack people as well as nations on their
   own soil and in their own homes. It’s an attempt to undermine a sense
   of safety and security and to instil fear. Hamas’ charter states that
   no one will enjoy peace and security unless under the control of Islam.

   There is only one way to deal with terror states. Total war that ends
   with the destruction of the regime and its military capabilities — like
   the war the United States led against ISIS or like the Second World
   War. Truth be told, you cannot wipe out an ideology — after all, there
   are still Nazis in the world. But the danger they pose today is
   different from the Nazi regime.

   Radical ideologies are far more dangerous when they control or form a
   state, or a territorial caliphate. That is why the United States, along
   with its allies in the Middle East and Europe, decided it couldn’t
   allow Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s Islamic State to persist. The same goes
   for Hamas.

   During the nine-month-long battle for Mosul, the world saw ISIS use
   thousands of people as human shields. Thousands were kidnapped and
   executed who didn’t want to be human shields. ISIS terrorists shot
   civilians who sought to flee to safety. Hamas operates in the same way.

   The Hamas terrorist, in some cases, is less than one mile from where
   our citizens were butchered, beheaded, and cold-heartedly slaughtered.
   But make no mistake, Israel is the West’s frontline in the Middle East
   — Israel is certainly not the end game as far as radical Islam is
   concerned. And Israel’s war against radical Islam is also the West’s
   war — even if it refuses to acknowledge that.

   Israel is grateful to the United States, to its people and the
   administration led by President Joe Biden for unwavering friendship
   that is once again standing up to the test. But the loss of moral
   clarity and compass in some of America’s top university campuses is
   extremely concerning — so too are the pro-Hamas protests in American
   and European cities with participants baying for the destruction of the
   Jewish state.

   Israel has no choice but to inflict an absolute defeat on Hamas. This
   war comes after six previous military rounds when Israel didn’t utilize
   its full might against Hamas. Since 2007, when Hamas seized control of
   Gaza, Israeli citizens have been subjected time and again to constant
   rocket, missile, and mortar fire on their homes.

   The war being waged by radical Islam against the West and its values is
   only at its start. Al-Qaeda, ISIS and Hamas are the opening chapters in
   a war against the West and its values. In fact, radical Islam already
   has a grip on many European cities.

   It is imperative for the West to learn an important lesson that Israel
   knew in the past and unfortunately forgot in recent times: It is better
   to fight your enemy on their territory rather than wait for them to
   come to you.

   Patience and tolerance towards a radical ideology that doesn’t
   recognize the legitimacy of your way of life is the greatest enemy of
   peace and coexistence. If the Western way of life is important and
   meaningful, then there must be a willingness to stand up and fight for
   it against its foes.

   Israel’s war against Hamas is crucial to the safety and security of its
   citizens but not only to them. It is also vital to the security of the
   democratic West and to the United States.
